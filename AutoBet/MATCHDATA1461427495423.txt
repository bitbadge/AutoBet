Immunity (Tier3, Form: 51.7) obviously are a bit of a question mark, since they can't face Euro teams on a consistent basis due their location. However in their previous shows they always provided performances in line with the Tier3, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a decent fight against Dignitas, even if the chances of watching them taking the whole Bo3 are quite low. On the ther hand Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) are obviously favored, they are part of the four top-ranked Tier2 teams looking for a Tier1 spot, and even if lately they stepped back a bit they are still pretty capable to deal with most of the T2-3 teams around. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Dignitas, and even if we agree on this trend, unfortunately the percentages are quite terrible and nowhere profitable. So we're a bit more oriented in attempting a #yolo ICB on Immunity just in order to add some pepper into the salad (but the chances for it to pay off are pretty low).
http://csgo.guru/match/3!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7022!$SKDC!$WinterFox!$WinterFox!$0.5!$0.36!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$As we get ready for DreamHack Winter, we do have one match of note on the schedule for tonight. Kind of an interesting low-end matchup for a best of three StarSeries contest. SKDC certainly isn't one the more relevant low teired teams, but gained some exposure during the RGN Pro Series. But more importantly they gained some much needed experience battling some of the more established and notable teams of the scene. However they didn't perform too well in their recent relevant matches, and are surely a good ways off from competing with the upper T3+ teams, but considering some of the recent bumps we've seen from their NA opponents here, we could see this game go to third map. The recent bumps of Winterfox just mentioned, were largely evident during their brief appearance at RGN. Granted, it was one of the very first events for the currently composed Wfx roster, but honestly we expected a little bit more from them than what they brought. Especially after a respectable entry game victory over Torqued. But since that win, Wfx's struggles have been on full display, even in their last online match vs 3sUP. So this should make for a good opponent for them to try and rebuild some confidence. Since these two teams, as currently composed, have no real match history to reference the veto will likely be driven by whichever maps both teams played well together in practice. So theres no basis to guess the final selection. Ordinarily we'd expect Wfx to be able to grab by a possible 2-0 sweep, but their recent troubles will likely see them lose at least one map, and even a chance to blow the contest all together, putting real-world odds at a 50/50 toss-up. But on our end, we believe the raw team skill of Wfx should be able to prevail, so our pick is a Low bet on them.

The first of the opening matches for this BO1 hell, features a pretty interesting matchup between Mousesports and NiP. Mouz has a had a decent start to the year, playing pretty consistently at a high T2 level, and have certainly made a strong case as a T1 prospect. At APM Finals, we watched the Germans dominate the field without losing a single map. So theres no question regarding their LAN capabilities, though here they'll surely have a more difficult path to travel, beginning with the Swedes who managed to to edge them out, twice, online last week for EPL. NiP on the other hand, have actually been one of the least active T1 teams of this first Quarter. However, to some surprise, the downtime seems to have had little to no affect, on their effectiveness and executions. But this will be their first LAN appearance of the year, so we wouldn't be too surprised to see them going through a small period of adjustment moving offline. Overall, F0rest and friends are good form entering the week, backed by a series of encouraging results. Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Swedes, which is correct, especially since they've already topped the Germans in their first two meeting this year. But Real-World Odds are way closer to even than the percentages we're seeing right now. Although they manged to wins those contests, but by the slimmest of margins, including some OT. On our end, we're inclined to pick the Swedes as well. But if the percentages reach 75/25, we're oriented toward trying our luck with an ICB on Mousesports, in hopes they take advantage of some NiP LAN rust for their entry game.

Little time, so getting right to it. LG was top seed and awarded a bye through the first round. So this is their first game today. They're coming off a mediocre performance with Cloud9, where the two split the EPL set. But Overall, the Brazilians at right at the top near the Swedes, so they're surely a level above shakier American-side. Selfless on the other hand,had to work their way into this match, by sweeping WinterFox 2-0. But they had to sweat for the 2nd map, but managed to end it quickly. Overall, Relyks and co. don't quite sport the firepower to match the Brazilian-side, so we doubt they'll manage more than a single map with the extended map-pool in play. So our pick is Low Bet Luminosity, or just skip since the percentages aren't really rewarding enough.

CSGL has recently shown some signs of stability, as they've managed to add two event dates to their calander. The Poles in the past months have seem to regain some consistency they've been in absence of, generally, for quite some time. And in March alone, they successful managed to secure their tickets for both DH Malmo, and just the other day adding DH Austin as well. And bring with them today, actually a decent winning streak and set of positive peformances. Meanwhile ALTERNATE aTTaX has really fall in a hard times recetly, in contrast to the Polish-side have collected a stretch of dispappointing outings. While CSGL was grabbing theor spot in DH, the Germans failed to even threaten in the closed qualifiy. And as for this matchup, they may likely manage to puch the contetst to a third map, but overall, we doubt they manage to upset the Poles while running on their current peak. So on our end, we're in agreement with percentages trendoing in favor of the Poles, so on our end, we're oriented in going with a Low Bet on CSGL, with expectation of watching them continue perform at a level on par with much of the Tier-2.
http://csgo.guru/match/7!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9140!$mouz!$Godsent!$Godsent!$0.52!$0.68!$-0.16000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Third match of the DreamHack Masters Malmo Quarter-Finals, and here we're expecting to watch a fairly balanced matchup. GodSent started their journey suffering a 16-11 defeat versus Natus Vincere, mostly triggered due to a far too risky map pick. However they quickly moved back on track and surprisingly managed to reach playoffs following victories over CLG and Gamers2.Ttwo matches that were far from easy, particularly for a newly formed roster. Anyway this event surely shed some light on the very high potential of this roster, and we'll likely watch them doing pretty well in the future too. On the other hand, Mousesports are actually the team showing the best things within the 2nd Tier. In the short-term, the German mix looked extremely consistent and have become a serious threat to Tier-1 rosters as well. Here in Malmo they hit the top of their Group, and forced others to the Deciders, such as Luminosity and Liquid, so ChrisJ and his gang are surely peaking right now and offering performances way above their average. Its worth mentioning that we now have moved to the BO3 format we might watch them slowing down their run a bit. About maps, we'll likely watch de_cbble, de_cache and de_train. If the Veto will take this way, Cache should be in favor of Mouz, while Train may go to GodSent and Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Mousesports, and this is correct since the Germans should sport a more complete knowledge on the extended map-pool compared to Pronax and friends. At our end we're prone in sticking with Mousesports as well, but honestly this is going to be a quite even game and we wouldn't be surprised to watch OTs and close scores.

Actually the current situation seems a bit more stable, so it's time to provide again some love to NA games. Talking about the current match, both teams never shone on the International soil, but locally they are pretty fine, since most of the NA teams share the same meta, with just C9 (and partially, ex-LG) standing out from the bunch. Usually CLG are a bit more consistent than Liquid, in particular on the extended map-pool, however we need to note that Hiko is currently standing-in (he's on a trial) for Liquid, and this may help a bit, even if his form isn't extremely high (61/100 according to our Ranking) or comparable to the first Quarter of the year. About maps, as displayed in our Veto Pattern graph, de_dust2, de_overpass, de_mirage and de_train are all pretty popular picks, and there are good chances to watch all of them if the match will last more than a Bo3. If it goes so, D2 and Mirage (here the edge is pretty low) should be in favor of CLG, while Overpass and Train are usually pretty random and can easily go both ways. Anyway, the default 1-0 is a pretty big advantage, and we doubt we'll watch CLG wasting it, or losing two Bo3s in a row, so, even if CSGL odds are currently pretty bad, we're oriented in picking an Avg bet on CLG.

This game and the following one will be played as Bo1, so as usual we'll enjoy a quite unpredictable fight, mostly decided by the veto-session together with some luck, rather than accurate planning. However we're sure that this will be a quite exciting game to watch. Both teams are currently rolling pretty fine, and looks like that Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) finally managed to re-acquire some self-confidence. Yesterday they managed to beat Dignitas with a clean 16-13 on Mirage and they ended the day with a 2-1 victory over Fsid3 in the FaceIT Qualifier Final, so we're sure they'll move here with a quite high motivation. On the other hand Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) are the hottest Tier2 team of the past two weeks, and looks like they're a step above Dignitas (they tilt frequently) and HR (they're inconsistent as hell). Additionally they already managed to take down Titan plenty of times in the short-term and they're the favorite candidate for switching with them in the Tier1 Olympus. Talking about the current match, current CSGL odds are skewed in favor of Kinguin mostly because two factors, the first one is the huge amount of Kinguin supporters scattered around the globe, but the 2nd is the previous Head to Head that these team had in early August during the PGL Qualifier, where Kinguin managed to take the Bo5 Final with a clean 3-0 score (Mouz later managed to Qualify via an 'Emergency Qualifier' happened as result of the EnvyUs's withdrawn). However we suggest to don't give too much importance to this result, since we're talking about a match happened in mid-summer and about a month ago. About the map, this time there are multiple possibilities since both teams share a kinda similar pattern, so the most likely options are de_mirage, de_train and de_overpass, but at our end we trend towards Mirage. If this will be the case, Mouz may have a little edge, but overall we're talking about a pure 50/50 game. Betting Odds are globally trending in favor of Kinguin, but as we stated above we really believe we'll enjoy a balanced game, so our pick is a Low bet on Mousesports.

However this is for sure a nice match-up, and probably the best one so far. Ukraine is fielding a mix between NaVi and HR players (S1mple just joined HR), with Bondik (actually the most consistent Fsid3 player, ranked #21 as Rifler, Form: 67.5) as icing on the cake. France is replying with a core composed by current/former EnvyUs players (Shox, Apex, Kennys, Happy) together with Rpk, who lately stepped up a lot. For sure the French lineup is extremely interesting, since most of these players are used to play together since a long time, and even if lately the shuffle mixed them, they still work well together. On the other hand, The Ukrainian roster looks a bit experimental, S1mple isn't playing seriously since he moved out from Fsid3, and he still has to play his first game with the HR shirt. Zeus and Edward are for sure a couple of solid picks, while Ange1 is a bit like Rpk, he started slow but currently he's doing quite fine. Betting odds are trending in favor of France, and this is understandable due the Envy-core, but honestly we're talking about a Bo1, so real-world odds are just in the middle and the match can easily go both ways, in particular if we'll watch a new map. Our pick is a Low bet on Ukraine in order to take advantage of the skewed odds.

EnvyUs are clearly several steps ahead of EzSkins, and for sure this will be an extremely difficult match for the British side.

However in their previous shows they always provided performances in line with the Tier3, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a decent fight against Dignitas, even if the chances of watching them taking the whole Bo3 are quite low.

On the other hand Germany is fielding players coming from three teams. Its quite an interesting mix of youngsters and experienced players, (such as Spiidi and Tabsen) so we're inclined to expect they'll jump in the game with quite an aggressive playstyle. That said, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a game closer than initially expected. Additionally, since this is a Bo1 format, (DE will likely push for a *new* map during the veto). Honestly, Russia is the better team, but we still actually feel this game pretty risky and certainly unpredictable due the composition of the German roster, so even thuough our pick is a Low+ bet on Russia, we do suggest caution with the values.

They continue slowly improving, which is for sure a good and promising thing. 3sUp performances on the other hand are quite random. They moreso resemble a pickup team, rather than a permanent team, and its been while since they've enjoyed pleasure of victory. Honestly there is plenty of room for a Tie, but since we need to choose a side, Method are certainly looking a bit more focused, and doubt we'll watch them lose twice, especially if they manage to pick de_mirage or de_dust2.

In the short-term they failed to achieve anything relevant, they lost against a wide range of T2 and T3 teams, and actually they are edging demotion to Tier3. On the other hand FlipSid3 are currently sporting a really amazing teamplay, for sure they lack a bit of raw firepower since with the exclusion of Bondik the rest of the roster is composed by pretty average players, but after-all the results are what matter and this lineup in the short-term improved a lot and they are actually solidly placed within the Tier2. For sure the Bo2 format used by CEVO may trigger a Draw, but for sure Fsid3 are the advantaged side, and the ones that in this game have more chance to take a 2-0 victory; so our pick is an Average bet on them.

In particular if they'll go for Mirage and Cbble. Betting odds are currently in favor of Titan, but honestly we don't believe they deserve more than just a 5% edge over Mouz, since we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game.

http://csgo.guru/match/27!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6492!$LG!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.39!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$And so we end today's Quarter-finals with what should be a pretty exciting matchup. The first seed coming out of Group A, Luminosity, took the hard road here. In the both of their first two matches, they had an uphill battle to climb as the underdog, but managed victorious over higher ranked opponenents in Cloud9 and Fnatic. LG began Cluj determined and prepared, having already moved to EU more than a week in advance in preparation for this DH lan event, and so far their commitment has paid dividends. So they're coming into this match rested after enjoy the winners' bye, but certainly brimming with confidence following the first two rounds. Natus Vincere on the other hand, didn't have the most difficult of a path to these qtr-finals, but did have to survive a decider match, to beat CLG for a 2nd time, after pushing past them the first time in their entry game. However, Navi was forced to the decider match after falling to EnVyUs in a humbling 16-9 loss on Day 2. Unfortunately, that loss exposed many weak points in Navi's game, so we're interested to see how intelligently LG manages that resource. But we need to note, Navi is undoubtedly the more experienced of the two, particluarly on lan. So the deeper this goes into the bo3, the more that may play in their favor. As for maps, we expect to we'll see de_Mirage, de_Cobble, and de_Dust2. If this is how it plays out, Navi should have a bit of an advantage on Mirage, while Dust2 and Cobblestone are mostly 50/50. So this for sure has all the ingredients for quite a potentially exciting finish to today's activity. Considering the impressive roll LG is on currently, on our end, we're oriented towards taking advantage of the percentages, so our pick is the slightly more rewarding Low bet on Luminosity.

On the other hand, nothing really new to say about FlipSid3, their firepower isn't crazy high but they compensate with a smart way to play and good strats, so usually they always manage to offer good fights against T2/3 teams. About maps, there are good chances to watch de_cbble, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, Fsid3 should be slightly advantaged on Cobblestone while both Train and Overpass are mostly 50/50. Betting odds are a bit too skewed in favor of Bondik and friends, while real-world ones are more in the middle, so at our end we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on SK, with the hope to watch them playing as good as yesterday.

Cloud9, as expected, has absolutely no issues in advancing to the round. Coming into this event directly from the winners' circle after winning IBP Cup, C9 didnt skip a beat as they rolled through the first round of competition. In the their 3 Group B matches, Skadoodle and friends conceded a mere FIVE round between all three games combined. Even with the inferior opponents, this is very impressive. So they drew the Group C runner-up. Games Academy is below teir 3, and not a team we've covered prior to this event. So our point of reference is as limited as C9's. The Brazilians did show some good things against SKDC and then again in their somewhat surprising victory over CSGL. But honestly, neither of those are a measuring stick for what LG can offer. Betting odds are overwhelmingly in in favor of Cloud9, which of course is to be expected. This honestly isn't even a fair matchup, and with the percentages being a heavy as they are, this must be an automatic skip, and save your skins for the next round. But naturally, feel free to bet on C9 if you gotta pick.

Kind of an interesting low-end matchup for a best of three StarSeries contest. SKDC certainly isn't one the more relevant low teired teams, but gained some exposure during the RGN Pro Series. But more importantly they gained some much needed experience battling some of the more established and notable teams of the scene. However they didn't perform too well in their recent relevant matches, and are surely a good ways off from competing with the upper T3+ teams, but considering some of the recent bumps we've seen from their NA opponents here, we could see this game go to third map. The recent bumps of Winterfox just mentioned, were largely evident during their brief appearance at RGN. Granted, it was one of the very first events for the currently composed Wfx roster, but honestly we expected a little bit more from them than what they brought.

So this should make for a good opponent for them to try and rebuild some confidence.

Overall they looked a bit revitalized, for sure a bit fresher compared to their latest kinda disappointing shows. So we can say that they are on the good path for regaining their momentum. On the other hand Natus Vincere had to work slightly harder in order to take home a victory over Luminosity. GuardiaN and friends managed to grab de_dust2 pretty smoothly, but they experienced more issues with Inferno, where the Brazilians managed to hit the Overtime. Anyway the OT featured a NaVi dominance and closed pretty quickly. This is basically a pure 50/50 game, we wouldn't be surprised to watch the 3rd map kicking-in or even require OTs. Both teams are fully capable of grabbing a victory, so we're talking about the riskiest game of the today's batch. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto goes so, both teams faced these maps plenty of times and they are all pretty balanced. However, former TSM should have a little edge on Dust2, while Overpass should be in favor of NaVi. Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are still sitting in the middle, but at our end we're oriented in gambling on the return of Dupreeh and friends, so our pick is a Low bet on ex-TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/33!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7515!$WinterFox!$Splyce!$Splyce!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Very slow week as we creep ever closer to the holidays, but we do have something to view on the NA schedule this evening, and actually kind of an interesting contest, paricularly since these two just competed several days ago. WinterFox is actually playing with more consistency than we've seen from them over the past few months. Recently their spot for ESEA S3 was in jeopardy, but Desi and co. pulled it together to retain their seat with a win over the challenging Denial. And then they faced off with today's opponent in their Group A Gameshow GSC contest, in pursuit of claiming 1 of the 2 spots for the NA region for the $200K Lan event in February, where Wfx managed a decisive 2-0 sweep. They continued their streak in another GSC match (vesus a subT3 team) to remain at the top of their Group. Not that it was the most relevant match, but the important aspect is Wfx has continued playing with some level of consistency, which as mentioned, has been one of their greatest issues in recent weeks. So this match should be a good measuring stick of that progress. SPLYCE on the other hand, has made a push recently to splash their way into the relevant side of the NA scene. There looked to be some possibility of progressing in that direction, following an impressive sweep of CLG in the Road to Vegas qualifier. However, NME ended that quickly in the Semis. Meanwhile, SPLYCE also had an opportuniy to earn a spot in the Season 3 of ESEA, but a struggling Method squad wasn't prepared to give up their spot, and SPLYCE was even able to grab 1 map. So overall, the once hopeful potential of SPLYCE has lost momentum, and remains T3, and they've additionally parted ways Stewie2k, so they'll be playing with a standin today. With regards to todays match, this is CounterPit, so the usual nonsense Bo2 format applies. There's limited data to reference, but there's good chances of seeing de_cbble and de_cache. But honestly, considering the above mentioned variables pertitnent to these teams currently, Wfx should be able keep their progress going and grab the win here today. Even worst case scenario, we'll see a tie. So our pick is in line with Current Betting Odds, for a Low bet on WinterFox.

Plus we currently find them both playing kinda inconsistent and not too reliable. However, this is a Bo2 match, and generally when two teams with similar issues meet, we typically see an outcome of a plain Tie. Anyway, about Vexed, we just want to remember that they generally step-up a bit when facing decent opponents, so we wouldn't be surprised to see the Polish side playing properly. Even though they aren't really solid on the extended map-pool yet. On the other hand, FlipSid3 are surely a step ahead skill-wise. But lately their gameplay is overly messy, and not really as sharp as they used to be in the past Quarters. Basically, without DavCost, their executions have turned a bit slow and predictable, when they previously had a good set of maps where they were able to setup quite great fights. Betting odds are slightly skewed in favor of Fsid3, but still decent for going Low on them, so we're oriented in sticking with Markeloff and friends for our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/35!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7892!$CPH.W!$FSid3!$CPH.W!$0.4!$0.27!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite relevant match, since the winner will move ahead in the IEM Katowice Qualifier, and later today will battle for a spot with the winner of the 2nd Semi-Final. FlipSid3 lately are on a quite impressive streak, their form is pretty high and they are one of the mid-tier teams that displayed the most interesting things in the short-term. They somehow managed to workaround the departure of DavCost, and actually they started playing in a simple but kinda effective way. On the other hand CPH Wolves are just the old Unu.AiN roster, surely an interesting one since Hunden and the gang never performed too bad, however they don't really field an huge firepower, and most of their focus is just on smart and quick plays. Overall, we wouldn't be surprised to watch CPHW taking a map, but on the extended map-pool FlipSid3 should be a good step ahead, so they're our pick for a Low+/Avg- bet. Worth noting that the current Betting Odds aren't really great, so we suggest to wait a bit and eventually skip if they drop below 18/82.

There isn't much to say about Cloud9. Over the short-term, the North American side didn't really play on a regular basis, and even less on the International field. Additionally this is their first LAN event with Stewie2K instead of SeanG@res. Overall we've serious concerns about their current form, and about their capability to deal with the rest of the Tier-1 teams without invested time with proper training (they didn't play a lot during most of the Winter season). Basically they're a pretty big question mark, so at the momeny we don't really find them to be a reliable choice. On the other hand, Gamers2 are the former [Titan] squad, who've always been quite an inconsistent team. Despite their roster, which features several really talented players, they never really managed to provide any solid shows over time, and typically they're prone to experiencing somewhat random peaks, directly followed by some terrible lows, so predicting how they'll play today is surely not an easy task at all. However, it is worth noting that they've managed to find a new home, so they might express themselves a bit better than during their most recent troubled month with Titan, so we have hopes slightly higher than usual. As for the maps, our opinion is we'll watch: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass. Should the veto go this way, both Dust2 and Overpass can easily go either way, while Cobblestone should be in favor of G2. Betting odds are still fairly balanced, and this is correct since we're talking about a match filled by question marks. But honestly we don't really find C9 a reliable pick due to the low number of official matches played as currently constructed. So we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Gamers2, hoping to see them freshly inspired and a bit more in form than in their latest exits.
http://csgo.guru/match/37!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8138!$LG!$Liquid!$LG!$0.55!$0.66!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second batch of NA EPL matches, and now we're messing with Liquid and Luminosity, on what looks like the most interesting contest of the today's NA schedule. Liquid are moving here after an extremely disappointing show against the CompLexity's new roster. Hiko and friends failed to deliver a proper show, and most of what they managed to put up was kinda pug-like, and pretty far from what we were expecting. Just like VP in Europe, Liquid are mostly paying the price for the lack of training during the winter season. But to their credit, they did manage to comeback on Dust to even up the series. On de_overpass they've always been pretty decent, but as stated above, we've serious concerns about their current form. Additionally we can't say that Luminosity are a 'forgiving' team. The Brazilians actually are one of the teams that performed better in this first part of the year. Aside from being pretty consistent on the extended map-pool, they are also sporting rather high form. Additionally, on this map they have taken down teams such as Astralis, so theres no question they know what they're doing right now. Betting odds are trending in favor of Luminosity, and this is correct since they should have a clear edge, so we're oriented towards going for Low+ bet on them as well, since right now we find them way more reliable than Liquid.
http://csgo.guru/match/38!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8198!$Ence!$Orgless!$null!$0.52!$0.64!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$2nd match of the day, with some more Counter Pit action, and again we have a fairly balanced contest featuring two pretty interesting teams. As we've discussed before, ENCE is a roster packed with some potential firepower. Although the Finnish lineup has struggled to find their rhythm and chemistry to string together wins in contests they surely have talent to win. As a result, we've instead watched a series of mixed results that likely threatens the future of the team. But they are entering this match following an improved performance against DenDD that earns the Finns a spot in CEVO S9. Now they just need to start doing this with more regularity. Meanwhile the former PixelFire lineup, playing currently as Orgless while searching for a new Org, demonstrated their potential during the PGL Minor last month. February by contrast hasn't been as promising, as they've mostly lost all their matches. However they are entering this match following their best game of the month, by way of a 2-0 sweep of CPH Wolves. Though we're encouraged by this, they need to show some consistency before we gain confidence in them. Betting Odds are rolling in favor of the Finns, which correct considering their firepower and (slightly) better recent results. On our end we're inclined to agree, but this is a format prone to draws which we've good chances of seeing. Though this may be closer than expected, percentages are still rewarding enough for Low Bet on ENCE so we'll follow that path.
http://csgo.guru/match/39!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8283!$Dignitas!$Vexed!$Dignitas!$0.55!$0.86!$-0.30999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Day 2 continues forward, as we move into the 14th match of Esl Barcelona. We just saw Astralis defeat NV, and keeping with the Danish alliance, they elected fellow countrymen Dignitas to square off with Vexed, in hopes of keeping the Danish teams in the best position for success in this tournament. As saw just two matches ago, the LAN success we've seen from Dignitas over the last several weeks is still going strong, but they were unable to close out the game against Fnatic, who forced the Danes into OT. But the relevancy here, is the competitive form RUBINO and friends are currently displaying. And now, thanks to the Astralis victory, they've been given the best chance for a win, having to face the Poles for their next battle. Vexed on the other hand, as we've discussed have been quite a mixed bag in recent weeks. In their entry game of this event, already faced the Danes for a disappointing show, in a contest the Polish-side never really threatened. Following a quick win over x6, they fell for the second time vs Gamers2. So they're now facing elimination for the first time this weekend. Current Betting Odds are already trashed in favor of the Danish. And based off what they've achieved on LAN in recent events, we're in agreement with strong chances here. Although, 85/15 to overly favored. Regardless, we are also confident with what they've done, so with these percentages we're oriented towards skipping this match, since we doubt Vexed can manage to stop the momentum of the Danes. But if you must pick a side, Dignitas is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/40!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8433!$mouz!$NiP!$mouz!$0.55!$0.32!$0.23000000000000004!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Day One in Poland for the 2016 IEM Katowice, sporting an impressive roster of teams battling it out over the next four days, and we begin with the Round-Robin Group Stage. The first of the opening matches for this BO1 hell, features a pretty interesting matchup between Mousesports and NiP. Mouz has a had a decent start to the year, playing pretty consistently at a high T2 level, and have certainly made a strong case as a T1 prospect. At APM Finals, we watched the Germans dominate the field without losing a single map. So theres no question regarding their LAN capabilities, though here they'll surely have a more difficult path to travel, beginning with the Swedes who managed to to edge them out, twice, online last week for EPL. NiP on the other hand, have actually been one of the least active T1 teams of this first Quarter. However, to some surprise, the downtime seems to have had little to no affect, on their effectiveness and executions. But this will be their first LAN appearance of the year, so we wouldn't be too surprised to see them going through a small period of adjustment moving offline. Overall, F0rest and friends are good form entering the week, backed by a series of encouraging results. Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Swedes, which is correct, especially since they've already topped the Germans in their first two meeting this year. But Real-World Odds are way closer to even than the percentages we're seeing right now. Although they manged to wins those contests, but by the slimmest of margins, including some OT. On our end, we're inclined to pick the Swedes as well. But if the percentages reach 75/25, we're oriented toward trying our luck with an ICB on Mousesports, in hopes they take advantage of some NiP LAN rust for their entry game.
http://csgo.guru/match/41!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8484!$LG!$Na'Vi!$LG!$0.48!$0.63!$-0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Incredibly fascinating matchup awaiting us here in the first Semi-Final of IEM Katowice 2016, featuring two of the top teams in the World out of the EU and NA scenes. Coming into the event, we knew Group-A held some surprises, considering the dynamic mix of elite talent within. Amongst this mix Luminosity have been top NA representative to have gradually forced their way into the top the pack, and over the past quarter+, they've developed a high level consistency needed to go deep in these championship tournaments. Being grouped with teams such as Natus Vincere and Fnatic (arguably 'the' two best in the world) and even NiP, the Brazilians weren't quite expected to take the top seed, or even reach the Quarters for that matter. However, FalleN and the gang, had no doubts of their own, going 4-1 through the Group Stage to grab the lone Semi-Final spot. Mostly impressively, they managed to grab consecutive wins over NAVI and Fnatic, and again look to be in full form for the trophy run. Meanwhile, Natus Vincere already grabbed two trophies this year, as favorites in these events dating back to last Summer. Although they managed to arrive in this Semi, the road here has surely been less convincing than Brazilian side. Mid way through group stage, they were on the outside looking in. But took advantage of their superiority, winning the final 3 maps their spot. Before the semis, they drew Tempo Storm in the Qtrs. The Brazilian group, kinda the little brother to LG, sporting extremely similar playstyles and practice routines. Despite the obvious advantage GuardiaN and friends held over Tempo Storm, many of the mistakes we saw from NaVi on Day 1, continued today, and had to climb back from a 13-8 3rd map deficit after seemingly having full control after Overpass. So currently we've serious concerns about the CIS-side against LG. We're not alone with these concerns, as current Betting Odds are trending in favor of LG. Percentages we really haven't seen before with NaVi on the other side. But we need to remember, much like the Swedes, NAVI tends to look a bit reserved in the early stages, but typically bring out the best as the stakes are raised. And here we also have a bit of history between these two at this level, so 3 maps and possible OT would't be at all surprising. Regarding the Maps, there's good chances we'll watch: de_mirage, de_train, and de_inferno. Provided we see these maps come out of the Veto, LG should be slightly favored on Train, NaVi advantaged on Inferno, leaving Mirage which could easily go either way. So we're pretty much looking at a pure 50/50 matchup, with RW Odds slightly edged in favor of NAVI, largely due to the success on the grand stage. On our end, we're wondering if this is finally the one LG can top. And at this point, there form looks to be the more solid of two, especially after watching what TStorm managed vs NAVI already today. So we're going to follow the trend and go with a Low Bet on Luminosity, in hopes of seeing them reach the Grand Final.

After a disappointing showing during the heart of Katowice, E-frag managed a couple of decent performances in the GameShow Invitational and GO:CL. Most notably was an Overtime victory of a struggling SK squad. Overall they’re in decent form coming into the weekend, but looking at the talent-pool for the event, we doubt they’ll offer any surprises past the Quarter-Finals. CPH Wolves on the other hand, have shown glimpses of potential, but they remain a level below much of 3rd Tier. They managed couple of solid efforts, earning them draws with ENCE and Vexed in mid-February. So they’ve surely shown the they’re capable of threatening the Bulgarians, but highly doubt they’ll manage to take more than a single map in the BO3. Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of the Bulgarian-side, which is correct when comparing the current levels of the two. On our end, we surely feel E-frag should take the match, and percentages are still rewarding for Low Bet, so we’ll follow this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/44!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8715!$VP!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.25!$0.2!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Day Two in Split, Croatia for the CounterPit Season 2 Finals, beginning with the first Semi-Final featuring matchup of teams expected to have advanced through the opening round. For their entry game, Virtus.Pro met the Oceanic qualifier Immunity which pretty much went as expected. The Poles didn't have to sweat much, finishing with a mostly dominant performance on Inferno, so it's still hard to know what to expect from them. A handful of wins in an otherwise disappointing first Quarter, they haven't really delivered anything reliable. Yet we've still seen a few flashes of the of the more threatening days, so the CIS-side knows they can't sleep on them. Natus Vincere on the other hand, surely had a more challenging task with FlipSid3 that needed all three maps to determine who was going home. But as usual, GuardiaN took the reigns and ensured NAVI would make it to the Semis. Overall, despite NAVI having not quite won as convincingly as they have in the past, and have needed to work harder, yet still getting the desired results. And are surely amongst the top 4 teams in the world. However, some of their missteps could pose an opportunity for PashaBiceps and the gang to exploit. Honestly though, we doubt NAVI will surrender more than one map to Poles. As for the maps, there good chances we'll watch de_overpass, de_mirage, and de_inferno after the Veto. If this ends up the pattern, NAVI will have small edge on Inferno, Mirage will favor VP, and Overpass could go both ways. Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of NAVI, who held a pretty decisive edge in their past meetings. However, what the Brazilians managed against the CIS in Katowice surely exposed some vulnerabilities, and we may likely again watch a match closer than expected. But we still feel NAVI is the more reliable pick, so we're going with a Low Bet on Natus Vincere.
http://csgo.guru/match/47!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8741!$Na'Vi!$Astralis!$Na'Vi!$0.48!$0.41!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Time to mess with the Counter Pit Grand-Final! In our event preview we clearly mentioned that there were extremely high chances to watch both Astralis and Natus Vincere reaching the final stage of this LAN, so at our end we're not really surprised about how the quarters/semis went (aside the upset pulled by NRG). However, Astralis are rolling into this game following a regular growth in form happened during the past months, the Danish lineup started the year kinda slowly but in the following months and in particular during the last 3 weeks, they started pushing the pedal to the metal, filling the gap from the top-3 leading teams. Here in Croatia, they managed to deliver two perfect matches, even if worth mentioning that due the NRG upset they ended into a quite 'easy' side of the bracket, while surely NAVI had to sweat way more in order to dismiss the well-ranked rosters they had to face. So yes, Astralis are surely looking really good so far, but this is going to be a pretty hard match, so don't expect to see Device and co. having an easy afternoon. On the other hand, as we mentioned above as well, Natus Vincere had to deal with a kinda messy road to the Final, they kicked-off the Quarter with a messy all-Ukrainian derby, always a tricky one, and they continued with the face-off versus VP, the Poles lately displayed promising things, even if they are still kinda out of form. At our end we're prone in believing that NAVI experienced their highest peak prior IEM Katowice, and lately their form dropped a bit, even if still quite aligned with the rest of the trending Tier-1 teams. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto will trend towards this direction, we'll enjoy a mostly balanced match, with Astralis slightly more favored on Overpass, and NAVI on Mirage, leaving Dust2 as a kinda risky middle ground. At our end, we're prone in giving the strongest momentum to the Danes, and betting odds are actually following the same direction as well. Percentages are still fine for going Low on Astralis, so this is our pick. But overall we're mostly talking about a match that can easy go either way.

With the 2nd NA Bracket for the 9th Season of CEVO underway, we move into the Quarter-Finals, for a pretty exciting matchup between the Brazilians and the Australians. We discussed in great length the level achieved in a short time by Tempo Storm, whose surge through the NA ranks began under the Games Academy banner, never slowing along the way. Most recently, Lucas and friends proved they were 'for-real' in Katowice, where they finished 2nd in their group to reach the playoffs. In the Quarters, they nearly eliminated one the world's top teams, Natus Vincere. Although the Brazilians fell 3 rounds short of reaching the Semis, what they managed against NAVI was nothing short of impressive. This performance, combined with over 2 months of mostly dominant efforts against the NA, demonstrated the threat they pose to the international scene. Meanwhile, Renegades hasn't had an active till these last few weeks. During which time, they've some mixed results, but aside from a select few of the NA's top teams, the Aussies have also been a team to watch out for. They walked over WinterFox with relative ease to reach this Quarter-Final, but we honestly don't think they'll be able to handle the Brazil-side through the extended map-pool, considering their struggles against the likes of Cloud9, Liquid, and OpTic. As for this match, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_inferno, and de_train. Assuming the Veto follows this path, Cache should favor the Aussies, Inferno will favor the Brazilians, and train could go both ways. Current Betting odds are trending in favor of Tempo, which we have to agree on, since they've been playing solid for some time now. Although we wouldn't be surprised to watch this go all three maps. Percentages are still rewarding for Low Bet on Tempo Storm, so they're our pick.

Honestly, here we're not reviewing a really super-amazing match. The TSM roster recently passed through some lineup changes, and AdreN stepped in to fill the shoes of Vice. On paper, this should be a switch pointing towards the right direction, even if we're still talking about a team mostly lacking raw firepower, rather than brain. However, its worth noting that the North American side faced a serious lack of decent results during the whole first Quarter. And only in the past few days they started looking a tiny bit revitalized. On the other hand, Renegades aren't doing too bad. They started the month in a pretty good fashion, hitting a good streak of positive results in ESL Pro League, but lately they dropped the ball a bit, and ended up facing troubles in facing the top-trending teams of the NA scene. About maps, we're expecting to watch de_mirage, de_train and de_cbble, and if the veto will go this way, we're oriented in giving an edge to the Aussies, since they should be slightly more reliable on the extended map-pool compared to TSM. Betting odds are still decent for going with a Low pick on Renegades, so we'll stick with them.

Little time, so getting right to it. LG was top seed and awarded a bye through the first round. So this is their first game today. They're coming off a mediocre performance with Cloud9, where the two split the EPL set. But Overall, the Brazilians at right at the top near the Swedes, so they're surely a level above shakier American-side. Selfless on the other hand,had to work their way into this match, by sweeping WinterFox 2-0. But they had to sweat for the 2nd map, but managed to end it quickly. Overall, Relyks and co. don't quite sport the firepower to match the Brazilian-side, so we doubt they'll manage more than a single map with the extended map-pool in play. So our pick is Low Bet Luminosity, or just skip since the percentages aren't really rewarding enough.

Here we've actually a pretty interesting matchup, that may be much closer than expected. Liquid have come to form over the mid-term, setting up performances aligned with the NA Tier-1. However, their most recent matches with OpTic and Renegades were bigger tests for the Americans, resulting in a close 2-1 loss to the Canadians, and settling for 1-1 with the Aussies. Considering the fairly recent changes to the lineup, we're not surprised to see them having some issues in highend matches, but they don't seem to leveled off yet. Meanwhile, as we mentioned earlier, TSM recently added adreN to the lineup, which was sure to add some firepower, but what they managed earlier against the Australians in the entry round, what better than we anticipated. Despite their string in inconsistent results since joining the Org, they managed one of their best efforts to date, landing them a spot in this Quarter-Final. A tricky element to this matchup, is the TSM's new 5th man, who is not only familiar with Liquid's Strats, but he's also on their starting roster for the MLG Major. Surely, he can offer invaluable insights to properly counter his teammates on the other side. As for this match, despite the X-factor of adreN, we still to give the advantage to Liquid. As for the Veto, we've no match history to refer to, based on their histories, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_cbble, and de_overpass. Although Liquid should have the edge through the extended map-pol, when viewing what TSM achieved against the Aussies, their best chances will be on Cobblestone and Overpass. Betting Odds are currently skewed in favor of Liquid, which is to be expected with TSM's lineup having little history together. On our end, we wouldn't be surprised to see close scores and maybe a third map. So we're gonna wait to see how Liquid plays their other games before this one, but unless they unravel in those contests, we feel they're the more reliable pick. So we're going with a Low Bet on Liquid.

NRG are rolling here after ruining their positive winning streak with an impressive 2-0 loss suffered versus Cloud9. After the good shows delivered during CounterPit Finals, we were expecting to see the EU/NA mix to keep their positive momentum also within the NA scene, but things didn't exactly go so, and what they displayed versus C9 was surely way below the average potential of this roster. On the other hand, WinterFox aren't really the most consistent team out there, but if they manage to hit a good evening they may turn into a a quite problematic team to shut down. In the past we watched Anger and co. delivering pretty crazy upsets, so we wouldn't be surprised to see them doing well. Additionally de_train always been one of their best maps, so we'll likely watch a pretty tight match. Betting odds are still slightly skewed in favor of NRG, but overall this is mostly a pure 50/50 matchup, and at our end we're slightly more prone in attempting a Low pick on WinterFox, mostly because of the map they're playing on.

The Poles in the past months have seem to regain some consistency they've been in absence of, generally, for quite some time. And in March alone, they successful managed to secure their tickets for both DH Malmo, and just the other day adding DH Austin as well. And bring with them today, actually a decent winning streak and set of positive peformances. Meanwhile ALTERNATE aTTaX has really fall in a hard times recetly, in contrast to the Polish-side have collected a stretch of dispappointing outings. While CSGL was grabbing theor spot in DH, the Germans failed to even threaten in the closed qualifiy. And as for this matchup, they may likely manage to puch the contetst to a third map, but overall, we doubt they manage to upset the Poles while running on their current peak. So on our end, we're in agreement with percentages trendoing in favor of the Poles, so on our end, we're oriented in going with a Low Bet on CSGL, with expectation of watching them continue perform at a level on par with much of the Tier-2.

FlipSid3 are actually sitting on a pretty terrible losing streak, and honestly we were expecting them to perform a bit better versus Dignitas, however worth mentioning that in the short-term the Ukrainians mostly faced top-tier rosters, and even at MLG Columbus (despite the early elimination) they managed to put up extremely promising fights, threatening both NiP and Mousesports in risky Overtimes. So we don't think they'll face relevant issues in dismissing Method. On the other hand, the Russian side still have to setup a viable set of strats for messing with the European sides, and in the past weeks they failed to provide performances on par with the Tier-3, so their current chances of offering a serious fight versus Markeloff and friends are pretty limited. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of FlipSid3, and dropping a bet here is not going to be profitable at all, so you should evaluate a plain skip. But if you want to pick a side anyway, the way to go is FlipSid3.

GodSent started their journey suffering a 16-11 defeat versus Natus Vincere, mostly triggered due to a far too risky map pick. However they quickly moved back on track and surprisingly managed to reach playoffs following victories over CLG and Gamers2.Ttwo matches that were far from easy, particularly for a newly formed roster. Anyway this event surely shed some light on the very high potential of this roster, and we'll likely watch them doing pretty well in the future too. On the other hand, Mousesports are actually the team showing the best things within the 2nd Tier. In the short-term, the German mix looked extremely consistent and have become a serious threat to Tier-1 rosters as well. Here in Malmo they hit the top of their Group, and forced others to the Deciders, such as Luminosity and Liquid, so ChrisJ and his gang are surely peaking right now and offering performances way above their average. Its worth mentioning that we now have moved to the BO3 format we might watch them slowing down their run a bit. About maps, we'll likely watch de_cbble, de_cache and de_train. If the Veto will take this way, Cache should be in favor of Mouz, while Train may go to GodSent and Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Mousesports, and this is correct since the Germans should sport a more complete knowledge on the extended map-pool compared to Pronax and friends. At our end we're prone in sticking with Mousesports as well, but honestly this is going to be a quite even game and we wouldn't be surprised to watch OTs and close scores.
http://csgo.guru/match/71!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9250!$AGG!$E-Frag!$AGG!$0.48!$0.36!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$GO:CL Semi-Final and on paper a pretty balanced matchup. AGG lately aren't really experiencing their brightest moment, and since their departure from Vexed, the Poles struggled in keeping their level on par with the rest of the European mid-tier teams. However, worth mentioning that during the last weeks they somehow managed to bounce back a bit, and their 3-2 victory over Epsilon in the Hitbox Grand-Final is surely promising. On the other hand, E-Frag generally always offered slightly more consistent shows compared to AGG, but in the short-term the Bulgarians are experiencing a pretty relevant amount of peaks and valleys, and overall the team isn't offering solid results as during the early part of April, when they managed to score a quite good winning streak. Talking about maps, we're expecting to watch de_mirage, de_overpass and de_cache. If the veto will take this path, Mirage may end in favor of AGG, while E-Frag should be advantaged on both Overpass and Cache. Betting odds are still floating around decent percentages, so at our end we're oriented in going with a Low pick on E-Frag, since we find them slightly more reliable than AGG.

However, honestly we believe that LG are a bit underestimated, this doesn't mean that you have to bet on them or that they're going to beat NaVi, but just that their lineup, featuring Pyth + DevilWalk may perform a bit better than expected, and provide a decent challenge in at least a map. Anyway, talking about the betting-side, this is a plain skip.

CLG yesterday did surprisingly good against C9, and despite they were playing with a stand-in, they still managed to take C9 to OT in the 2nd map, and overall they offered a solid show. Liquid faced more issues against Mouz, and they didn't understand at all the Mouz's way to play, heavily focused in countering their opponent, however for sure today will be easier for them, since this is a Local game, and both teams know each other pretty well. About maps, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a weird veto, and this kind of match-ups are usually kinda prone to upsets. There are good chances to see : de_mirage, de_train and de_cache as maps. If this happens, Mirage should be in favor of CLG, while both Cache and Train can go both ways. Current CSGL odds are around 60/40 in favor of CLG, so pretty fair, but due the composition of this match we're more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Liquid.

TSM didn't play too much in the past weeks, they skipped ESWC and they failed pretty hard during ESL/ESEA Finals, where they went out during GroupStage after a couple of embarrassing performances. Basically the last Lan they played seriously is the first stage of FaceIT Finals, back in June, where they managed to hit the first spot, so it's safe to say that they took a little summer break right after that performance. Right now we don't really know their current form, and they're playing with their cards covered, so they're a bit of a question mark. On the other hand NiP lately are playing Bo1s better than Bo3s, and they seem more on point during GroupStages rather than Playoffs, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing fine, even if TSM are a bit their black beast, and they usually suffer their gameplay a lot, in particular if they'll end playing on de_cache. Current CSGL odds are still fine, and quite even, so we feel more confident in going Low on TSM, with the hope to watch them moving back on the right track.

On the other hand CLG keeps doing little steps in the right direction, but we believe they're still quite far from T1 EU teams, even if the Bo1 will for sure help them a bit. Current CSGL odds are quite bad already, so you can either skip or go Avg on NiP, but honestly we're more for skip (there are better match for transferring skins to bots).

Mouz just completed their preparation prior ESLOne and they moved here well trained and ready to mess with T1 teams, while Cloud9 are rolling strong since early Summer and they turned into a serious T1 contender, fully capable to take down most of the teams they face. Odds are currently 60/40 in favor of C9, but actually both teams share a kinda similar veto pattern, and we'll probably enjoy a quite close Bo1 and maybe an OT as well. Just like above we're more oriented in gambling with Odds and attempting a Low/ICB bet on Mouz.

Actually CSGL odds for this Bo3 aren't anything exceptional, and TSM are for sure advantaged, however, we need to remember that Kinguin are currently pretty random, and they may grab a map and provide more fight than expected. About maps, there are good chances to watch de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, D2 should go to TSM, while both Overpass and Train can easily go both way. CSGL odds are currently pretty off, so the best idea is going for an ICB on Kinguin and keep your fingers crossed.

Mouz are just back from their not-so-exciting run at ESL One Cologne, and technically their form should be pretty decent, however we fear that their mind is not actually here, hopefully NiKo will be able to bring some freshness (he'll sub for ChrisJ). On the other hand, D&amp;G are basically the lineup that is born from the ashes of Gamers2, with just the addition of Loord, a quite promising pick, mostly because the huge experience boost he can provide. For this game they'll play with Morelz, subbing for MINISE, according to our Polish boyz not the best pick out there. Current CSGL odds are pretty skewed in favor of Mouz, but honestly we believe they'll be able to grab this Bo3, and D&amp;G, just like the old G2 lineup, never played matches featuring an extended map-pool in a consistent way. Our pick is an Avg bet on Mouz
http://csgo.guru/match/150!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5112!$CLG!$Liquid!$CLG!$0.6!$0.78!$-0.18000000000000005!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This is the first NA we cover in several months, as many of you are already aware of, we took a pause from the NA scene in June due the never-ending-shuffle that kept mixing the cards twice a week. Actually the current situation seems a bit more stable, so it's time to provide again some love to NA games. Talking about the current match, both teams never shone on the International soil, but locally they are pretty fine, since most of the NA teams share the same meta, with just C9 (and partially, ex-LG) standing out from the bunch. Usually CLG are a bit more consistent than Liquid, in particular on the extended map-pool, however we need to note that Hiko is currently standing-in (he's on a trial) for Liquid, and this may help a bit, even if his form isn't extremely high (61/100 according to our Ranking) or comparable to the first Quarter of the year. About maps, as displayed in our Veto Pattern graph, de_dust2, de_overpass, de_mirage and de_train are all pretty popular picks, and there are good chances to watch all of them if the match will last more than a Bo3. If it goes so, D2 and Mirage (here the edge is pretty low) should be in favor of CLG, while Overpass and Train are usually pretty random and can easily go both ways. Anyway, the default 1-0 is a pretty big advantage, and we doubt we'll watch CLG wasting it, or losing two Bo3s in a row, so, even if CSGL odds are currently pretty bad, we're oriented in picking an Avg bet on CLG.
http://csgo.guru/match/151!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5146!$VP!$TSM!$VP!$0.5!$0.52!$-0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Basically the only really interesting match scheduled, and the only one we're going to cover today, since the rest of the games are below Tier 3, or part of the Qualifiers for the World Championship (we won't cover it till Playoff, most of the current matches are pretty weird and don't follow any pattern). Talking about the teams, yesterday VP managed to roll over Kinguin in a pretty easy fashion, while TSM experienced hard times with NaVi, failing pretty hard in both Dust2 and Overpass, despite a pretty promising start on Mirage (a map where NaVi are usually on-point). The current match will be played as Bo5, so the Veto-session is not relevant as it is in Bo3 games, and then we need to read our Veto Pattern graph in a bit different way, basically looking for the side with the straightest line, this will show how much a team is consistent on the extended map pool. Another important factor is the Form, and according to our World Ranking, TSM (despite their disappointing performance vs NaVi) are actually sporting a pretty high short-term score (67.78), while VP are floating considerably lower (61.9, and this value is so mostly due Pasha being quite inconsistent in the last Quarter, not on par with the rest of his team). According to this, we believe we'll watch TSM doing better on the classic maps, while VP will likely perform better on the new ones; with de_cbble and de_dust2 very likely vetoed off. Current CSGL odds are slightly skewed in favor of VP, but we're talking about a pure 50/50 Tier1 game, so at our end we're oriented in playing a bit with these percentages, and our pick is a Low bet on TSM.

Talking about the current match, the 99DMG Arena is mostly a warming up cup, so we don't expect amazing performances and overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch teams playing quite below their full potential. However, usually the Bo3 format is a bit more in favor of HR, since they're slightly more solid on the extended map-pool, while Efrag most of the times need a more specific veto in order to provide a solid show in Bo3 games. Actually we didn't add the APM data to the site yet, so our Veto Pattern graph is missing several key Head2Head matches that are important in order to analyze this match-up, anyway by crossing the Veto-Lines of both teams you can easily figure out which maps are shared; so there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_overpass and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, Overpass is in favor of HR, while Inferno and Cache can easily go both ways. Current CSGL odds are trending in favor of HR, but at our end we're more oriented in attempting a Low bet on EFrag mostly because the more rewarding percentages, since we're not talking about a super-relevant match and both teams aren't really in form yet.

However, Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) are clearly advantaged, and despite Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.7) managed to show good things, there are pretty good chances to watch a plain 2-0. About maps, we'll likely watch : de_overpass, de_train and de_mirage, if the veto will go so Fnatic should be advantaged on both Mirage and Train, while Overpass could be a tiny bit more balanced. As stated above, the CSGL odds are terrible, so you can either skip or go for a #yolo ICB on Dignitas (if you've some spare cents to waste).
http://csgo.guru/match/154!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5234!$D&G!$Titan!$null!$0.45!$0.18!$0.27!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Here Titan might have their chances to redeem themselves from the several really disappointing results achieved in the past weeks, yesterday against HR they already managed to bounce back after just another last-half choke against Mouz, so overall we can say that their issues are quite mitigated by the Bo2 format, and they're doing generally better in CEVO compared to Bo3s games. On the other hand D&amp;G (Tier3, Form: 53.9) are still quite random and not really consistent, they keep alternating God-Like days with horrible ones, and they're kinda unpredictable, however what we can for sure affirm is that they are usually relevant on just a quite limited amount of maps, and if Titan will handle the veto smartly there are good chances for watching a plain 2-0 in favor of the French side. Unfortunately (and luckily for the Polish fans) Titan aren't famous for their good veto sessions, so we'll likely watch : de_mirage and de_overpass as maps, and if the veto goes so we'll likely watch a pretty tight and balanced match. Current CSGL odds are overly skewed in favor of Titan, so we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB on D&amp;G.

Overall there isn't much data available for King Hunden and friends, and so far they mostly played against quite low teams, with the only exceptions of Property (that within our World Ranking are frozen, due their unstable roster) and E-Frag (the Bulgarian side won by measure), and honestly we kinda doubt we'll watch them doing fine in more than a map. About HR, currently they're a bit in a slump compared to the rest of the top-ranked Tier2 teams (Mouz &amp; Dig), and lately they looked quite lost strats-wise, but they're still fully capable to mess with Reason and they have good chances to take this game with a plain 2-0. Current CSGL odds are still decent for an Average bet on HR, so this is our pick, and overall in the worst case we should watch a Tie.

Say welcome to just another episode of the endless battle between Titan and Dignitas, where Titan are (desperately) trying to keep their Tier1 spot, while Dignitas, (together with Mouz) are assaulting it relentlessly on a daily basis. This is a CEVO match, so we're talking about a Bo2, currently Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) are facing pretty hard days, their consistence in Bo3 matches is pretty questionable and they keep losing focus during the final part of the matches, the crucial moment when we talk about 50/50 match-ups. However, today we're talking about a Bo2, and this is a format that for sure will help a bit the French side, while Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.5) are usually a bit vulnerable when they're forced to play in maps they don't like (as we observed in their latest game against Mouz, where the veto didn't exactly go as they were hoping). About maps, there are quite huge chances to watch : de:_mirage and de_mirage and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, Mirage lately is trending in favor of Titan, while Cbble is mostly 50/50. Current CSGL odds are slightly favoring Titan, and honestly we doubt we'll watch them losing both maps, so we agree with the trend and we pick a Low+ bet on them as well.

These games, unlike the GroupStage matches we enjoyed so far, will use the Bo1 format, so they may lead to upsets and nothing is written in stone. Talking about the match it self, yesterday NaVi didn't manage to put up a great fight against TSM, and they lost de_overpass in a quite dumb way, by choking the easiest side. On the other hand yesterday Dignitas had to deal with a stand-in (Maziaz instead of Nico) and overall they played quite bad in their CEVO game against Titan, and even worse versus Mouz a day before. Obviously nailing the correct map is way harder due the Bo1 format, in this case we believe we'll watch de_mirage, and if it goes so NaVi should be advantaged (but they MUST fix their CT side). Current CSGL odds aren't exceptional, and currently floating around 80/20 in favor of NaVi, but honestly they're advantaged and we believe they'll move forward in facing Kinguin in the next match that will be played later today, so our pick is an Avg bet on them.

Enemy and coL are quite new lineups, born from the summer shuffle, with diametrically opposed way to play the game, additionally they both sport several quite promising youngsters, so there are good chances to watch an interesting and fast-paced match and maybe a final result a bit closer than expected. CompLexity are currently doing pretty fine, they already showed that they can mess with both Liquid and CLG, so they're obviously favored for taking this match, on the other hand Enemy aren't too bad but looks like they've serious issues in closing the games despite the promising starts. Current CSGL odds are pretty bad and barely rewarding, so you can either skip or (if you really wish to bet) go for an Avg+ bet on coL (we doubt we'll watch them losing twice, and in the worst case we'll probably watch a Tie).

This game and the following one will be played as Bo1, so as usual we'll enjoy a quite unpredictable fight, mostly decided by the veto-session together with some luck, rather than accurate planning. However we're sure that this will be a quite exciting game to watch. Both teams are currently rolling pretty fine, and looks like that Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) finally managed to re-acquire some self-confidence. Yesterday they managed to beat Dignitas with a clean 16-13 on Mirage and they ended the day with a 2-1 victory over Fsid3 in the FaceIT Qualifier Final, so we're sure they'll move here with a quite high motivation. On the other hand Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) are the hottest Tier2 team of the past two weeks, and looks like they're a step above Dignitas (they tilt frequently) and HR (they're inconsistent as hell). Additionally they already managed to take down Titan plenty of times in the short-term and they're the favorite candidate for switching with them in the Tier1 Olympus. Talking about the current match, current CSGL odds are skewed in favor of Kinguin mostly because two factors, the first one is the huge amount of Kinguin supporters scattered around the globe, but the 2nd is the previous Head to Head that these team had in early August during the PGL Qualifier, where Kinguin managed to take the Bo5 Final with a clean 3-0 score (Mouz later managed to Qualify via an 'Emergency Qualifier' happened as result of the EnvyUs's withdrawn). However we suggest to don't give too much importance to this result, since we're talking about a match happened in mid-summer and about a month ago. About the map, this time there are multiple possibilities since both teams share a kinda similar pattern, so the most likely options are de_mirage, de_train and de_overpass, but at our end we trend towards Mirage. If this will be the case, Mouz may have a little edge, but overall we're talking about a pure 50/50 game. Betting Odds are globally trending in favor of Kinguin, but as we stated above we really believe we'll enjoy a balanced game, so our pick is a Low bet on Mousesports.

Kinguin just rolled over Mouz in a pretty easy fashion, and this wasn't expected at all, in particular we weren't really expecting to watch de_train as pick, of course it was in the 'magic 3 circle' but also the worst choice for Mouz. About NaVi looks like they're currently facing some internal issues, and they easily turn angry to each other too frequently and mid-match, this is causing a drop in their performance and motivation, and for sure played a role in their 2-0 defeat against HR happened yesterday. However, they are a top-tier team, and they can handle a Bo1 even if not in their best condition. Current CSGL odds are quite aligned with our real-world ones, so we're oriented in going with a Low/Avg bet on NaVi.
http://csgo.guru/match/164!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5349!$Kinguin!$E-Frag!$Kinguin!$0.6!$0.77!$-0.17000000000000004!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$This is the first match of the Gaming Paradise LAN currently taking place in Portoroz, Slovenia. Both teams already faced each other just few days ago, and Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) managed to grab a 2-1 victory after a quite shaky first map, then in the following days they somehow managed to fix some of their issues and currently they're on a quite nice streak and yesterday they displayed really good things against TSM too. On the other hand Efrag (Ranked 6th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) aren't bad at all, and the LAN environment may boost a bit their teamplay, even if we need to say that they didn't face any real top-tier opponent in the short-term (with the exclusion of Kinguin and HR), so we're not so sure we'll watch them taking more than a map. About the veto, in our opinion and according to our Veto Pattern graph, we'll likely watch : de_dust2, de_mirage and de_train. If it goes so, Dust2 may go to EFrag, while Mirage is in favor of Kinguin, and Train can easily go both ways. Overall the Betting Odds are pretty skewed in favor of Scream &amp; friends, but this match could be more tight than expected, so we don't see any reason for not attempting an ICB on the Bulgarian side.
http://csgo.guru/match/165!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5352!$Method!$NME!$Method!$0.56!$0.8!$-0.24!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Just a quick note about this game, since it's featuring pretty sweet Betting Odds, while in reality we'll very likely watch a pretty close game. Method are for sure a bit advantaged because they're sticking together since a quite long time (they're the former Fenix lineup) compared to Enemy, and in the short-term they also started providing promising results against top-5 teams, so for sure they are a team to watch. On the other hand Enemy technically shouldn't be too far, and their lineup is potentially a bit better, but their gameplay isn't mature yet and quite prone to dumb mistakes. As stated in the first line, Odds are quite skewed in favor of Method so an ICB on Enemy may pay off.

Overall SK played pretty well against D&amp;G and we're kinda surprised by the cold blood they displayed, additionally we need to note that they already managed to beat Hellraisers several times in the short-term and looks like that they know how to counter them effectively. Obviously HR are a high-ranked Tier2 team and even if lately they're experiencing issues they're obviously slightly favored. Betting Odds are heavily in favor of the CIS side, while we believe we'll watch a tough match, so our pick is a Low bet on SK.

Currently VP (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) are doing pretty well and in the short-term they managed to beat most of the average T1 opponents, they only fell against EnvyUs, which is overall a pretty scary opponent. On the other hand Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) in the past weeks mostly battled with Tier2 teams rather than T1 ones, but looks like that they stepped up a bit on Lan and their performance (early today) against Mouz was pretty convincingly. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_cbble, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will follow this pattern, Cbble and Overpass should be quite balanced and aligned to 50/50, while Mirage is in favor of VirtusPro. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of VP due their better short-term performances and a solid H2H history in facing Titan, but honestly despite they are for sure advantaged percentages are really too skewed, and with these odds we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on Titan.

Betting odds are currently pretty bad, but we're talking about a kinda safe game, so it's quite normal. Our pick is an Avg-High bet on LG, but if you don't like to bet on skewed odds you can skip without regrets.

As we stated many times already, their main problem is their heavy mid-game inconsistency, they are totally unable to follow the same pattern for more than a round. On the other hand Fsid3's teamplay improved a lot since S1mple left, but unfortunately now they lack of raw fire-power, and despite they consolidated their position within the Tier2, they still have issues in messing with high-ranked teams. The good part is that usually they show decent things against teams like SK, so we're confident we'll watch them winning at least a map. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch : de_train and de_cbble (or de_mirage). If the veto goes so, FlipSid3 (Ranked 5th in Tier2, Form: 56.6) should be better on both, while D2, if picked may go to SK. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Fsid3, obviously they are a bit more skewed than real-world ones, but honestly we kinda agree on this trend, and Fsid3 should be able to win at least a map and (in the worst case) Tie the match.

Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) as expected didn't face any real issue in rolling over Titan on Cobblestone, and their executions were looking so easy that made us think that they still have plenty of margin. On the other hand TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) played an extremely good match against VP, and achieving a fair and square 16-10 victory on Overpass, where VP are usually quite on-point, isn't an easy task at all. Talking about the current match, Fnatic are obviously favored and the team to beat, honestly we don't believe they have any weak map in particular that TSM may use to make the game more even, maybe just Train may leave some doors opened, but the chances to watch it aren't extremely high. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Fnatic, and we agree on this, so our pick is an Avg bet on the Swedish side. However CSGL percentages are actually REALLY skewed, so also an ICB on TSM is a legit option (if you like cents), and for sure a bit more 'relaxed' pick than going high on Fnatic and then sweating like a bear in summer if the match will be -suddenly- closer than expected.
http://csgo.guru/match/172!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5440!$Fnatic!$Titan!$Fnatic!$0.7!$0.89!$-0.19000000000000006!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$This is the Group B 2nd place decider match, and the winner of this game will move forward to playoffs and face VirtusPro in the second Semifinal. Honestly there isn't much to say, Betting odds are already extremely off, so this is mostly a nice match to watch rather than to bet on. Yesterday Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) surprisingly managed to lose against TSM, but it was deserved since the Danish side performed God-Like during OT, however de_dust2 is always a tricky map, and we don't even know why Fnatic didn't ban it, since it's one of the few maps where they are a bit below their average level. On the other hand Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) finally woke up a bit, and cleaned their poor entry game performances with a superb show against NaVi. For sure the Bo3 format is in clearly advantage of Fnatic, they are generally better on the extended map-pool, and there are good chances to watch a plain final 2-0 in their favor. As we stated above Betting odds are quite terrible, so you can either skip or try a #yolo ICB on Titan (but the chances to watch an upset are quite remote). With these percentages, there is no point in going High on Fnatic for basically no reward.

Talking about the current match, Penta aren't doing really fine, and after a peak during early summer looks like they started slumping again, so far they failed against most of the T2-3 teams around, frequently with scores below the acceptable, and overall without being a threat. Mouz during the last week slowed a bit their run, but they are still one of the better performing T2 teams, and one of the candidates for a Tier1 spot. We highly doubt we'll watch them losing twice against Penta, and in the worst case we'll see a Tie. Betting odds are currently pretty off, but this is a kinda normal since we're mostly talking about a quite safe game, so you can either Skip (odds aren't rewarding after-all) or go High on Mouz.

However this is for sure a nice match-up, and probably the best one so far. Ukraine is fielding a mix between NaVi and HR players (S1mple just joined HR), with Bondik (actually the most consistent Fsid3 player, ranked #21 as Rifler, Form: 67.5) as icing on the cake. France is replying with a core composed by current/former EnvyUs players (Shox, Apex, Kennys, Happy) together with Rpk, who lately stepped up a lot. For sure the French lineup is extremely interesting, since most of these players are used to play together since a long time, and even if lately the shuffle mixed them, they still work well together. On the other hand, The Ukrainian roster looks a bit experimental, S1mple isn't playing seriously since he moved out from Fsid3, and he still has to play his first game with the HR shirt. Zeus and Edward are for sure a couple of solid picks, while Ange1 is a bit like Rpk, he started slow but currently he's doing quite fine. Betting odds are trending in favor of France, and this is understandable due the Envy-core, but honestly we're talking about a Bo1, so real-world odds are just in the middle and the match can easily go both ways, in particular if we'll watch a new map. Our pick is a Low bet on Ukraine in order to take advantage of the skewed odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/181!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5545!$mouz!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.33!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty interesting match, NaVi (Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1) as we stated in the previous match (SK vs NaVi), are coming from a quite disappointing campaign @ Dubai, and honestly we wouldn't be surprised to watch them experiencing some issues against a top-ranked Tier2 teams such as Mouz, in particular on a classic map as de_inferno where they already struggled during Gaming Paradise (quite irrelevant result tbh) and PGL (this is more relevant). Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) overall are doing pretty fine, they're a solid lineup, but we don't suggest to take too seriously their latest few so-so results, since they are from Gaming Paradise. Additionally Mousesports are usually a bit better online than on Lan, and their performances are generally a bit more on-point in Bo1 matches rather than extended map-pool ones. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of NaVi, and this is quite obvious since we're talking about a Tier1 team, however we don't suggest to overlook Mouz, in particular on de_inferno where they already managed to provide a serious fight against Envy. At our end we're a bit more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Mouz than going with NaVi with the risk to watch them playing Dubai-like again.
http://csgo.guru/match/184!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5576!$Fnatic!$TSM!$Fnatic!$0.5!$0.62!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Match of the day, and the game most of us are waiting in order to check if Fnatic will be able to take their revenge after their defeat @ Dubai. TSM (Ranked 5th in Tier3, Form: 50.6) yesterday looked a bit rusty, for sure a consequence of the few days off the took right after Dubai. Against HR they played a pretty bad first half, and with a bit more focus (and a non-mix roster) HR could have managed to grab an upset, something that didn't happen because TSM at some point woke up. The following match, against EnvyUs, went even worse, here the Danish side failed to put up any plan, and despite they fragged a lot (even more than the Frenchmen) they ended with a quite heavy loss. On the other hand, Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) looked pretty on-point in their last couple of matches, and honestly their fail @ Dubai is probably just a single unlucky 'episode' rather than a real trend. About the map, we're pretty sure we'll watch a replay of Dubai, so again de_dust2, basically the re-match we are all waiting for. Betting odds are in favor of Fnatic, and we kinda agree on this trend since they're still the Top1 and overall quite solid on most of the map-pool, additionally they are also quite consistent in Online matches.

EnvyUs are clearly several steps ahead of EzSkins, and for sure this will be an extremely difficult match for the British side. Recently Envy hasn't performed too great against the rest of T1 teams, but in this case they should be able to take a victory in a pretty easy fashion. Betting odds are naturally super-skewed in favor of Envy and not profitable at all, so you can just skip this game without regrets (or go High on Envy if you enjoy winning Bizons).

We've only a couple of mins in order to cover it before the start. Betting odds are obviosuly in favor of Envy, and honestly they are unquestionably the better team. Dignitas looked a bit shaky against Renegades and still managed to win but they still risked a lot in the late part of the game, despite playing the CT side of Cbble. Our pick is an Avg-High bet on Envy.

Neither team encountered much opposition along the way, so it should make for truly entertaining and welcomed showdown between two of the best teams in the world. EnvyUs (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8) advanced here after quickly dispatching the up-and-coming CPHW in a two game sweep, lead by a stellar performances from NBK and apEX. So they surely seem to be in form. Meanwhile TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) also swept their way past Dignitas, but nearly found themselves needing the 3rd map in their bo3 to advance. But otherwise thier road here has been relatively issue-free. It is worth noting that TSM are going to need more from Karrigan if they hope to matchup with NV. As for the maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, there is a high probability to watch de_dust, de_inferno and de_train. If that is how the veto plays out, Dust2 may go to TSM, while Envy should have the advantage on Inferno. Leaving Train, which can easily go both ways. Current odds favor NV, but we feel this is more likely a 50/50 tossup, sure to require the 3rd deciding map. Since the odds wont benefit much from an NV pick, we're slightly oriented towards a low bet on TSM to take the prize.
http://csgo.guru/match/200!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5697!$Dignitas!$Imm!$Dignitas!$0.6!$0.89!$-0.29000000000000004!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$Here we've a bit more interesting and (on the paper) balanced game, compared to the previous (Group A) one. Immunity (Tier3, Form: 51.7) obviously are a bit of a question mark, since they can't face Euro teams on a consistent basis due their location. However in their previous shows they always provided performances in line with the Tier3, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a decent fight against Dignitas, even if the chances of watching them taking the whole Bo3 are quite low. On the ther hand Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) are obviously favored, they are part of the four top-ranked Tier2 teams looking for a Tier1 spot, and even if lately they stepped back a bit they are still pretty capable to deal with most of the T2-3 teams around. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Dignitas, and even if we agree on this trend, unfortunately the percentages are quite terrible and nowhere profitable. So we're a bit more oriented in attempting a #yolo ICB on Immunity just in order to add some pepper into the salad (but the chances for it to pay off are pretty low).
http://csgo.guru/match/201!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5709!$Fnatic!$NiP!$Fnatic!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is probably the best match we'll enjoy today, Fnatic already managed to lose on de_dust2 against TSM during Dubai Invitational, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch NiP (Ranked 5th in Tier1, Form: 69.0) doing fine on it, according to their recent trend (they already managed to beat Fnatic on de_cache few days ago) and their regained motivation. However, despite the Dubai Bo1 mess, we need to remember that Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) are still the top-1 in the world and the team to beat, so real-world odds are obviously a bit in their favor, even if we're talking about a map quite prone to upsets. Betting odds are skewed in favor of Fnatic, but honestly here the way to go is a Low bet on NiP, in order to take advantage of their strong momentum, and because Dust2 is one of the very few maps where Fnatic never excelled at (they are still pretty good though).

About CLG, we're kinda impressed by them since they managed to comeback from a pretty messy situation, by battling pretty hard on maps where usually Euro teams are advantaged, so looks like they moved here a bit more in form compared to what they displayed locally. About Fsid3, honestly we were expecting them in troubles against CPH Wolves, but instead they managed to put up a brilliant performance, and overall are looking quite fine. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Fsid3, but real-world percentages are more aligned to the middle, so our pick is a Low bet on CLG.

On the other hand EFrag are following a quite similar pattern, and honestly there are good chances for them to move to Tier3 soon, since their performances aren't really on par with the rest of the T2 group. About maps there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto goes so, SK should be a bit better on both Overpass and Train, while Efrag should be able to grab Mirage. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor of EFrag, and this is a bit weird since this trend is based on when both teams were doing decently, so today we're mostly talking about a quite even match and then we're more oriented in going Low on SK.

However, they're going to have their hands full with more talented HellRaisers (Ranked 1st in Tier2, Form: 64.6.) Theres no question HR is bigger contender here, as they push to make their way into Tier 1 after recently adding S1mple to their new lineup, and hope to see Stockholm host this progression. But first they'll have to dispatch a desperate and shaky Vexed. Following the veto, we expect to see de_cbble, de_dust2, and de_train. HR will grab Cobble, and Vexed will be most competitive on Dust2, and if the 3rd map is necessary, HR will look to close there. Odds are expected skewed heavily in favor of HR, but Vexed has historically put up a decent fight against Tier 2 teams, and we believe this pattern raising the risk some for this matchup. So we suggest keeping your bet low on HR.

Advancing to the Upper Bracket requires this match mostly as a formality for Titan who have kinda-cemented their position in Teir 1 for some time. So they'll likely use this match as a warmup practice for their subsequent match against the winner of Vexed/HR. This will be also the first offline match featuring ScreaM wearing again the Titan shirt, after his departure from Gamers2. Skyred on the other hand, will gladly take the media exposure awarded them from this DH appearance, and hope to catch Titan underestimating them to their detriment. But even then, they too will look forward to the outcome of Vexed/HR, in hopes of stretching their DH visit another day. With this match, the map pool really wont have much bearing on the outcome, likewise a bet here would yeild so little gain we suggest to skip and makes plans for your skins on another match.

Both teams squared off already yesterday, in a match that saw HR easily roll over the Polish. However we need to note that these teams are coming from one of the easiest Group of the qualifiers, with Titan as the only serious contender. (Skyred surprised everybody in their losing effort, where they may have earned a little repsect, but they still weren't able to advance.) So actually we wouldn't be surprised to watch a more of an inconsistent game, additionally because Vexed (former eBettle) typically steps it up some in key matches compared to standard ones. However, HR surely has the advantage. The addition of S1mple mostly solved their common lack of firepower, and right now they have things rolling pretty well. Even their strats are looking a bit more complex and overall playing smarter compared to their past performances. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_overpass, de_cbble and de_dust2, and if the veto will go so HR should be better on both Dust2 and Cobblestone, while Overpass can easily go both ways. Our pick is an Average bet on HR, but we need to note that the current Betting odds are already pretty terrible, so an ICB on Vexed could be a good and suitable option.

Sweden (as usual) is sporting a hell of lineup, featuring some of the best players around, together with the pretty promising youngster Pauf. About the rest, Xizt is a pretty solid pick, Dennis and Maikelele work pretty well together and Pronax is one of the best IGL around. Even if this roster is missing some of the various star-players available to the Nordic country, we're still talking about a really consistent lineup. On the other hand Norway is basically fielding the entire former LGB lineup + Reasten. This is quite an interesting choice since these players are pretty used in playing together, so they should already have some great chemistry. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch them putting up a strong fight, especially with benefit of the Bo1 format. Our pick is a Low+/Avg-- bet on Sweden, but we suggest to avoid huge values due to the high risk.

Russia is moving here with the same lineup they sported in the previous game against United Kingdom, so overall looking at a pretty fine roster. On the other hand Germany is fielding players coming from three teams. Its quite an interesting mix of youngsters and experienced players, (such as Spiidi and Tabsen) so we're inclined to expect they'll jump in the game with quite an aggressive playstyle. That said, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a game closer than initially expected. Additionally, since this is a Bo1 format, (DE will likely push for a *new* map during the veto). Honestly, Russia is the better team, but we still actually feel this game pretty risky and certainly unpredictable due the composition of the German roster, so even thuough our pick is a Low+ bet on Russia, we do suggest caution with the values.

This group is probably the best lineup the country can field, but overall these players have only achieved few decent International results (at least in CS:GO.) The most recent relevant achievement is a surprise victory over Renegades during DreamHack London. On the other hand, Russia is entering the game with a pretty good lineup. Maybe this iteration lacks some fire-power since both Hooch and WorldEdit are moreso 'master-minds' rather than pure fraggers, but even still this is a team that shouldn't face any issue in rolling over the Englishmen. For sure the Bo1 format will add some element of randomness to the mix, but at our end we remain confident in picking an Avg bet on Russia.

Yesterday Gamers2 managed to roll over Mouz in a pretty easy fashion, something we weren't expecting due the recent departure of Scream and the series of shaky results they achieved in in the short-term. However, for sure having Flusha as stand-in helped a lot, since he's currently one of the players with the highest Form of the whole scene. On the other hand NiP, a few days ago stopped their quite good winning streak and failed a couple of extremely close matches against Fnatic (but honestly this is quite understandable), in between they fell versus TSM as well (this time not really understandable) with a quite impressive score on de_train, the same map that they are going to play today against G2. For sure lately NiP didn't perform great on Train, but on the other hand G2 never played it too much or on a consistent basis, so we're more oriented in picking a Low/Avg bet on NiP due their highest experience on this map.
http://csgo.guru/match/213!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5829!$EnVyUs!$VP!$VP!$0.45!$0.52!$-0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last big match of the day, and a quite interesting one since Betting odds basically reversed after EnvyUs lost against TSM in the first game of the day (CounterPit Grand Final). Honestly we don't suggest to change bets or flag right after a single lost match, in particular if we're talking about a game played @ 17pm (== early for EU standards) where much likely Envy stepped into with too much confidence, still strong of their victory @ DH London. For sure against Virtus.Pro they'll be back on planet Earth, and hopefully a bit more focused. However we need to say that de_mirage is a VP map, they always played it in a pretty decent way, while on the other hand EnvyUs never really impressed on it, so we're oriented in considering this match as 55/45 in favor of the Polish side. Betting odds are still moving a lot, but a Low bet on VirtusPro should be fine.
http://csgo.guru/match/219!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5845!$Coast!$LG!$LG!$0.4!$0.06!$0.34!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$One of the cevo matches being held tonight is Coast Gaming Vs. LG. This will be a BO2 match as it takes on the Cevo format. Which will most likely end in an LG 2-0 victory. Coast Gaming is made up of Canadian and US Mix of DUMORE, Stanislaw. draek, draWsoul, and inVert. They are a rather young team trying to find there way in a largly and what seems to be getting more clustered of a NA Scene. As more and more teams come on, players will continuoulsy rotate until they find a group that they mesh with and play well together. We do not see this team doing very well, but they are young and things can change. Player to watch for Coast gaming is Du Luminosity on the other hand is the Brazillian team with an American Dream. They are still on the hunt to find themselves at the top of the NA scene. As they continue to work out their kinks, you can see the improvement in both game style and sense along with strategies to help them ascend the ranks. The key player to watch for LG is coldzera. About the maps: We believe you will see de_dust2, and de_cobble. With that being said, we believe LG to be slightly better on de_dust2 and we do not expect they'll have much of an issue with Team Coast on de_cobble. As mentioned, we believe that LG should manage to take this match with a 2-0 victory as they continue to grow as a team and continue to get better, so an average bet on them is reasonable. Worst case scenerio we see this match ending in a draw, all skins returned.

Since we're talking about a CEVO Bo2, good chances are they can easily end in a draw. Method are for sure not the most consistent team out there, but we at least need to give them credit on the fact that they never give up and just keep fighting. They continue slowly improving, which is for sure a good and promising thing. 3sUp performances on the other hand are quite random. They moreso resemble a pickup team, rather than a permanent team, and its been while since they've enjoyed pleasure of victory. Honestly there is plenty of room for a Tie, but since we need to choose a side, Method are certainly looking a bit more focused, and doubt we'll watch them lose twice, especially if they manage to pick de_mirage or de_dust2.

EnvyUs are for sure advantaged on de_cbble, and we don't believe we'll watch them facing too many issues against HellRaisers, unfortunately the percentages are already quite off, and there is no point in going High on the French side for basically no reward. On the other hand the chances to watch HR pulling an upset aren't really high, so we're more oriented in calling a Skip. But if you like #yolo bets, feel free to throw a couple of bizons on S1mple and friends.

However, since CLG are clearly favored, the Bo2 format should guarantee a relative safeness.

Obviously EnvyUs are favored and even though the French side have never provided many outstanding performances on de_train, we highly doubt we'll watch them fail against a pretty disorganized team such as SK. As stated above, betting here is mostly a waste of time, since the chances to see an upset are extremely low, while the percentages for going with EnvyUs, on the other hand, aren't profitable at all. If you really want to drop a bet here go for Envy, otherwise just skip and move to the following game.

Both teams are entering this bo3 elimination contest following a couple of mediocre performances. Between the two,Virtus.Pro ,overall, probably demonstrated slightly more encouraging play. To be honest, their game against TSM could've been closer. Their results on de_inferno weren't too surprising since VP has never offered exceptionally good shows there. But we weren't actually sure how they managed to fall on de_train after the brilliant T side they performed. In short, had they hung on for the victory on de_train and pushed the match to a win or lose at de_cache, they could very well have had a different final outcome. On the other hand, Fnatic rolled over Liquid in relative ease, but they completely overlooked de_cbble. A map where usually play well, but they didn't approach the map with the right mindset or with a real plan behind the hood. Hopefully they'll be a bit more focused against VP. Now as for the current match, we can only say that we expect an extremely balanced match. Both teams are looking pretty well aligned, and in quite similar form. Fnatic are a bit better overall on the extended map-pool, and they'll certainly gain some advantage from the fact that VP will very likely avoid de_dust2. A map where the Swedes' weaknesses were exposed over the past few weeks. About the veto, we're pretty sure we'll watch: de_overpass, de_cbble and de_train. If this is how it unfolds, Fnatic should take Cobblestone (they weren't trying too hard for some reason in their match today vs Liquid...), VP may grab Overpass, while Train could easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Fnatic, but this is a pure 50/50 match-up. So feel free to go Low on VP in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/239!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5963!$WinterFox!$LG!$LG!$0.4!$0.06!$0.34!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say regarding this mid/low tiered matchup. Winterfox is coming to match directly following their match with Conquest. So they are sure to be more warmed up, but based on their match history, they need every advantage they can get. A series of losses has inhibited Wfx from gathering any steam for some foward progress as a team. Meanwhile, Luminosity continues to gradually improve and mesh as a team, so we don't expect them to find too much a challenge in handling the struggling Wfx team. However, this is a Cevo bo2, so keeping in mind the trend with many of these mid- teir matches, good chances for draw if LG can't manage the sweep. Its been a week of upsets, so risks seem slightly higher than normal, but we're still confident in a minimum of seeing all skins returned on a tie, however odds are so terrible you may consider a skip or an average pick on LG.
http://csgo.guru/match/240!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5968!$E-Frag!$FSid3!$FSid3!$0.4!$0.4!$0.0!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Just another quite even Tier2 match. E-Frag lately started playing in a quite inconsistent way, and their form is nowhere near the one they displayed during mid-summer when they were running really hot. In the short-term they failed to achieve anything relevant, they lost against a wide range of T2 and T3 teams, and actually they are edging demotion to Tier3. On the other hand FlipSid3 are currently sporting a really amazing teamplay, for sure they lack a bit of raw firepower since with the exclusion of Bondik the rest of the roster is composed by pretty average players, but after-all the results are what matter and this lineup in the short-term improved a lot and they are actually solidly placed within the Tier2. For sure the Bo2 format used by CEVO may trigger a Draw, but for sure Fsid3 are the advantaged side, and the ones that in this game have more chance to take a 2-0 victory; so our pick is an Average bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/241!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5994!$HR!$NiP!$HR!$0.4!$0.33!$0.07!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well, third match in a row for NiP on de_cbble, the first two against Fnatic and TSM didn't go too well, but at least HellRaisers should be a manageable opponent. Overall HR never really played Cobblestone in an impressive way, but we should keep in mind that they already managed to beat NiP just a week ago, and they countered them really well, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them offering a serious resistance. Betting odds aren't too bad, NiP are for sure advantaged and the previous 2 matches should have woke them up a bit, so we're confident in picking a Low+/Avg- bet on them, with the hope to watch them winning at least a match.
http://csgo.guru/match/242!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6016!$Liquid!$Method!$Liquid!$0.7!$0.82!$-0.12!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Honestly not much to say about the 2nd NA match we're covering. Method has lately appeared as though they're coming to life, and they are currently to be taken as a threat in the NA Tier2. But they are still have a ways to go before being considered amongst the top-ranked teams, so Liquid shouldn't face any real issue in rolling over them. Especially since we are talking about a match taking place on de_overpass. A map where Liquid has played pretty well, not just against NA teams but also versus the top EU competition, so we're pretty confident in going with an Average bet on them (Liquid), even though current Betting Odds aren't the least bit exceptional. (So wait a bit before placing your bet, and if the percentages turn into 90/10 just skip).

Just like France, Russia too fielded a Tier1 team, featuring quite a solid roster composed of experienced well-hardened veterans and the NaVi's stars Flamie and Seized. Overall, they done pretty well so far, even though they probably struggled a bit more than expected against Norway. But they are still a lineup fully capable of grabbing a map from the French tank. France, on the other side, are advancing here as huge favorites. They have the most complete lineup of the pack, who are also have the benefit of having played together due to the French shuffles. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of France, and though we agree the Frenchmen certainly have the advantage, but the current percentages edging 85/15 are a bit ridiculous. So we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on Russia (even if the chances for an upset aren't higher than 35-40% or so).

Anyway, talking about their team-performances they are in a slump since a pretty long time, and their red-text filled match history is quite self explanatory. On the other hand, Penta aren't the most consistent team out there too, but at least they usually have a decent teamplay together with a decent plan, so we are prone in considering them slightly advantaged, even if we're talking about a Bo2 match that will very likely end in a draw. Betting odds are still decent for a Low bet on Penta, so this is our pick, but honestly we don't believe we'll watch one of the sides taking the upper hand, (in particular if CSGL will manage to play on de_mirage) so as stated above the chances to see a Tie are pretty high.

Here we've a CEVO Bo2, and honestly this is a quite balanced match, both teams have highs and lows on pretty different set of maps, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch the game ending in a Tie. In particular if they'll go for Mirage and Cbble. Betting odds are currently in favor of Titan, but honestly we don't believe they deserve more than just a 5% edge over Mouz, since we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game. At our end we are a bit more prone in attempting a Low bet on Mouz, in order to take advantage of the pretty off odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/251!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6146!$Fnatic!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.45!$0.43!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Match of the day and one of the most even fights we'll enjoy today. Bo1s on de_cache are always quite hard to predict, in particular when we talk about a top3 T1 match involving a couple of great teams. Fnatic lately slowed their run a bit, and they started facing serious issues against the now trending TSM and Envy rosters. However in this case both the Swedish side and EnvyUs always shared a similar level on Cache, but they always used a way different approach to the game. While the Frenchmen are usually more prone to counter-stratting, the Swedes are always way more aggressive and they used to be quite deadly in their T side compared to the average T1 trend (their T-side on this map is actually 2nd only to VP). Honestly in this specific match-up, the Envy's passive approach may work a bit better, so we're more oriented in going for a Low bet on them, anyway we suggest to avoid huge values since you shouldn't be surprised to watch Fnatic starting to the pedal to the metal.
http://csgo.guru/match/253!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6191!$TSM!$mouz!$TSM!$0.6!$0.81!$-0.21000000000000008!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second game in a row for TSM, this time the Danes are playing again on de_dust2, the same map where yesterday they lost against NiP. For this match their opponent isn't a T1 team but Mousesports, one of the Tier2 teams actually providing the most promising performances. Generally TSM are quite good on Dust2, despite their yesterday loss they always managed to put up quite great shows against all the T1 teams, so we doubt we'll watch them facing too many issues against Mouz. On the other hand Mouz never really excelled on D2, they for sure played it plenty of times and they also managed to achieve a couple of upsets on it, but overall they never provided a consistent flow of good performances on this map, so we're not prone in considering them as really reliable. Betting odds are trending in favor of the Danish side, and currently they are still decent for a Low+/Avg bet on TSM, so this is our pick too.
http://csgo.guru/match/255!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6163!$VP!$Na'Vi!$VP!$0.55!$0.63!$-0.07999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Well, this is basically the only EU match scheduled for today. Despite this being a couple of top-tier teams, we don't suggest to take it too seriously, since these kind of showmatches are pretty pointless and in this case, both teams will get money regardless (winners will get $10,000, losers $5,000). So there isn't an huge difference between winning and losing. Virtus.Pro are generally better on the extended map-pool, so they should have a slight advantage from the Bo5 format. Additionally, they are also sporting stronger momentum and overall they're doing quite well. On the other hand, Natus Vincere haven't show much amazing stuff over the short-term. They had issues in dealing with Tier2 teams, and their gameplay is a bit messy compared to what they showed us during mid-summer. Anyways, as we stated above, we aren't really talking about a super-relevant match, so if VP joins the game with an overly relaxed mindset, (very likely), we might watch NaVi taking advantage of this in the entry maps. So after-all, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a close game hitting 4-5 maps. Betting odds are currently quite skewed in favor of VP, and honestly we do agree on this trend. But the Polish side has actually been more consistent compared to NaVi, so our pick is a Low+ bet on VP.

Both Virtus.Pro and EnvyUs are currently doing quite fine, the Polish side is probably performing a bit more consistently compared to the Frenchmen, but we need to note that Envy are prone to overlook only low-tier games, so we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 match-up. With that said, VP never enjoyed too much playing on de_dust2, even if lately they improved a lot (and managed to achieve many convincingly results too). On the other hand Dust2 always been one of the winning horses of the French side, and one of their usual map picks, but in the short-term the lack of training together with some unneeded over-confidence caused them to drop the ball more than once. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Envy, but honestly we don't believe that their real-world edge is higher than just a 55/45, so we're a bit more oriented in playing with the odds and going for a Low bet on VP, hoping to watch the Polish side setting up a decent fight as they recently did against Fnatic.

Both teams are kinda inconsistent since a quite long time, lately CSGL recovered a bit their form but they are still pretty off in a wide part of the map-pool, so we're usually very careful when we talk about Bo3 games involving them. On the other hand, Reason yesterday surprisingly managed to beat SK, something not obvious at all since it was a Bo2. Overall this lineup isn't too bad and with some effort they could be able to hit Tier2. However, Reason should sport a better teamplay, while CSGL usually compensate their poor executions with aim and personal plays (but this is a quite momentum based way to play, and it doesn't work on the mid/long term). Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Polish side, but as mentioned above this is a pretty risky game, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Danes setting up a good fight, so our pick is a Low bet on Reason.
http://csgo.guru/match/259!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6303!$WinterFox!$Cloud9!$Cloud9!$0.35!$0.09!$0.26!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not a whole lot to say on this match, which is also the only NA match worth covering tonight. The best team from the North American scene, Cloud9, has been on quite a roll lately. With the exception of the suprising defeat they suffered at the Crown's Invitational against Immunity, they've been victorious in all their contests over the last five weeks. This stretch of wins includes two games versus today's opponent Winterfox. Meanwhile the divided roster composed by Wfx has had great difficulty putting together more than one random win in a row, let alone wins in general. Till they complete their move, they'll almost never perform to their full potential. But as for todays match vs C9, they'd face an uphill battle even if the lineup weren't on opposite sides of the Atlantic. As for the map, the Bo1 will go down on de_cache. Both teams are quite comfortable on Cache, but C9 has overall yielded better results here, and we don't believe Wfx will be able to offer much resistance. So our pick is an average bet on Cloud9.

[SK] are in a slump since a quite long while, and early this week they lost the services of K0nfig, who stepped out from the roster. On Train they probably played a bit more than Penta, but currently their team status is really messy and their motivation is even worse. On the other hand Penta always vetoed Train on a consistent basis, and today they're playing here mostly for training purposes than anything else, overall they are for sure the better team but we don't suggest to waste too much stuff in a game between a couple of pretty low-tier &amp; random teams. Betting odds are still pretty even, and honestly not really appealing, our pick is a Low- bet on Penta, but you should consider a plain skip too.
http://csgo.guru/match/264!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6381!$HR!$SK!$SK!$0.6!$0.73!$-0.13!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$well, lately HellRaisers are cruising into quite troubled waters, and all the issues related to S1mple and his contract are for sure casting some shadows on the team despite the really promising results achieved in the short-term. However, here we're talking about an ESL game, so the Ukrainian young talent wasn't allowed to play anyway, and then HR are relying on the usual random stand-in (lately Dosia, but not confirmed for today yet). On the other hand SK are experiencing troubles since a quite long while, and they're playing with a sub too, since K0nfig left them just a week ago. Talking about the game it self, generally HR are quite decent on de_mirage, and they should be able to roll over SK without too many issues, so our pick is a Low+/Avg- bet on HR.

EnvyUs never enjoyed too much playing on de_overpass, they always vetoed it on a consistent basis, and they never really provided super-duper shows on this map. On the other hand Mousesports for sure played it a bit more and with promising results, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them hitting an upset since their fellow countrymen Penta, already managed to achieve that just a week ago (so prior the pre-Major mindset, and with cards still partially uncovered). However, with both teams involved in a Major guessing who will give all and who will keep their best for the upcoming games isn't really easy, at our end we're oriented in considering this game as a pure 50/50 and we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Mouz due the slightly more rewarding percentages.

Yesterday Vexed managed to scare Fnatic a bit thanks to a start with the pedal to the metal on de_cbble, then the Swedes woke up and took home a victory, but without any doubts the Polish side set up a quite good show, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them giving all today as well, in particular since Cloud9 are looking a bit shaky. On the other hand, the North Americans faced serious issues in dealing with Luminosity, despite they were playing on a map where they used to be quite on-point. However, they must win this game if they want to avoid the shame to go home after just a couple of games. Betting odds are still quite decent, so at our end we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Cloud9, mostly because we don't believe they'll give up, but honestly we'll watch a close match, in particular if Vexed will manage to force C9 on a 'new' map (cbble/ovp/train).

For the first time in a pretty long while Fnatic are facing a potential early elimination in a Major. But honestly, when considering how badly they performed in the first two days, its no surprise they find themselves in this situation. Yet still quite unexpected, since to their detriment, both Vexed (JW and friends risked a lot against them) and Luminosity (here they lost 16-13) weren't really considered huge threats by the Swedes. However Fnatic still have arrows in their bow, and to their benefit, Cloud9 didn't impress in their two matches either, where they just didn't seem to be on-point. So Fnatic still has a solid chance to advance through and reach the playoffs. As just mentioned, C9 had quite a terrible first day, and they weren't able to impose their gameplay against Luminosity at all, despite de_dust2 being a map they always played extremely well. Anyways, in the following game they somehow managed to beat Vexed, even though they again didn't play exceptionally well. But it was enough to move to the decider. As for the match at hand, there are fairly high chances to watch this Bo3 require all 3 maps. Especially if we watch de_dust2, de_train and de_cbble as maps. If the veto goes so, C9 should have advantage on D2, while Train can easily go both ways and Fnatic will likely take Cobblestone. Betting odds are already extremely skewed, and barely profitable for a bet on Fnatic, so since real-world percentages are more around 60/40 we're more oriented in going for an ICB on Cloud9, even if (obviously) the likelihood of seeing it pay off aren't extremely high.

The first seed coming out of Group A, Luminosity, took the hard road here. In the both of their first two matches, they had an uphill battle to climb as the underdog, but managed victorious over higher ranked opponenents in Cloud9 and Fnatic. LG began Cluj determined and prepared, having already moved to EU more than a week in advance in preparation for this DH lan event, and so far their commitment has paid dividends. So they're coming into this match rested after enjoy the winners' bye, but certainly brimming with confidence following the first two rounds. Natus Vincere on the other hand, didn't have the most difficult of a path to these qtr-finals, but did have to survive a decider match, to beat CLG for a 2nd time, after pushing past them the first time in their entry game. However, Navi was forced to the decider match after falling to EnVyUs in a humbling 16-9 loss on Day 2. Unfortunately, that loss exposed many weak points in Navi's game, so we're interested to see how intelligently LG manages that resource. But we need to note, Navi is undoubtedly the more experienced of the two, particluarly on lan. So the deeper this goes into the bo3, the more that may play in their favor. As for maps, we expect to we'll see de_Mirage, de_Cobble, and de_Dust2. If this is how it plays out, Navi should have a bit of an advantage on Mirage, while Dust2 and Cobblestone are mostly 50/50. So this for sure has all the ingredients for quite a potentially exciting finish to today's activity. Considering the impressive roll LG is on currently, on our end, we're oriented towards taking advantage of the percentages, so our pick is the slightly more rewarding Low bet on Luminosity.

While on the other hand SK are in a slump since a while, constantly under lineup issues (today they'll play with MODDII as 5th). Additionally we need to note that they very rarely managed to put up AAA shows against T1-2 teams on this maps. Betting odds are already quite off an not really rewarding so you can either skip or go Average on TSM.

Cloud9, arguably the best team out of NA, has fallen on some hard times lately. Yesterday we expected a bit of a bounce back after a disappointing Cluj appearance, but even Complexity and 3sUP were too much for them as their struggles continued. Considering the amount of firepower on C9, it's hard not to expect them to turn it around at any point. Meanwhile, Winterfox is still in their infancy stage for their new lineup. So we're not putting too much stock in their losses yesterday, which despite the end result, still mostly offered a decent show as a roster with limited experience. So we expect see their confidence grow with each match, and look foward to seeing how they progess. Normally, we'd expect C9 to be a good measuring stick match for Wfx, but as just stated C9 is not currently playing anywhere near the level we're used to seeing from them. Furthermore, this Faceit Bo1 will be hosted at de_overpass, where statistically Wfx should have an advantage especially since they defeated C9 here before Cluj by a shocking 16-3 two weeks back. But again, that wasn't the same Wfx team and C9 was playing with a standin. Overall, on paper, this match should be easy pick on Skadoodle and friends, but there recent struggles are edging towards the point of concern, so we're really unsure which C9 will show up tonight. Between that and the new Wfx, this may be a match to skip. But if a pick is a must, we're honestly slightly more oriented in chasing the bigger rewards (on the chance C9 is still playing with their heads in the clouds - excuse the pun) and placing a ICB bet on Winterfox. At least until C9 shows something encouraging.
http://csgo.guru/match/274!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6579!$CSGL!$SK!$null!$0.5!$0.36!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an obvious match as may look at first sight, CSGL in the past weeks looked a bit more focused than before, but as we stated in their entry game as well, they still have critical lacks on the extended map-pool, and we don't believe they'll manage to hit 2 maps in their favor during the veto. On the other hand, SK despite the slump lasting since months, and all the roster related issues, finally saw some light and in the past few matches they displayed encouraging performance. Obviously they are still an extremely unreliable team and mostly a mix, but at least they should be able to grab a map and Tie the game. Betting odds are still floating a lot, but honestly we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game, so we're a bit more oriented in gambling with the percentages instead of picking a side for on-paper performances. So our pick is a Low bet on CSGL.
http://csgo.guru/match/275!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6618!$LG!$mouz!$mouz!$0.55!$0.55!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Super interesting game since yesterday both teams managed to hit a couple of crazy upsets, and they surprisingly managed to achieve them with fair and square 2-0 scores, something surely promising and not really easy to do when we talk about Bo3 Lan matches. Luminosity basically destroyed Titan, and the French/Belgian side failed to put up any relevant fight despite the maps (Cache/Cbble) weren't too bad, and on paper quite manageable. On the other hand Mousesports pulled an half-miracle out of the hat, and this is for sure even more impressive than the LG-Titan game, since NaVi hit a 2nd place in Cluj just a week ago, and in this game they were considered as the clear favorite. However, we truly believe that when they are focused, the Germans can actually deliver quite good shows, and probably in Cluj they didn't manage to perform properly mostly due the really high pressure. Betting odds are currently slightly skewed in favor of LG, and this is correct since the Brazilians are slightly more consistent than Mouz, but honestly this is going to be a pretty even game, since both teams have a really similar veto-pattern (we'll likely watch: de_cache, de_overpass &amp; de_cbble), so we're a bit more prone in playing the odds and picking a Low bet on Mouz.
http://csgo.guru/match/276!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6654!$CLG!$NME!$CLG!$0.55!$0.82!$-0.2699999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$The only other match of the weekend following the conclusion of CEVO S8 Finals, another RGN game featuring a pair of fairly acquainted NA teams. Since DH Cluj, CLG has had a pretty busy schedule, but their results have been inconsistent with performances even more shaky. In their last game we saw them get dominated by CompLexity in match they only managed to win 3 rounds, which is quite out of character for them. Overall, they currently seem to be on a bit of decline. But their last decent outing was against today's opponent. Enemy on the other hand has also been challeneged with issues of consistency as well. However, in the past few weeks, we've seen a gradual improvement in their teamplay skills and noted they're starting to put together some stronger perfomances and appear to be on an upswing. So this match against a T2 CLG might be arriving at good time for NME take advantage. For the maps in this best-of-3, we should see de_cache, de_overpass, and de_train. Both teams are quite familiar on these maps, but statistically CLG should have the advantage provided they play to form. Betting odds are currently skewed well in favor of CLG, but on our end, we feel real world odds are much more balanced. Granted, on paper, this should be an easy match for Tarik and friends since we're talking about a game taking place on the extended map-pool, but if they don't take NME seriously today it could be to their detriment. So with percentages being so skewed, we're oriented by a yolo mentality and inclined to go for the ICB on NME.
http://csgo.guru/match/278!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6695!$Titan!$VP!$VP!$0.5!$0.37!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty nice game, and a match-up we already enjoyed plenty of times in the past weeks. Virtus.Pro are stepping here with the CEVO title in their bag, but despite the trophy their form is just average and not as exceptional as you may believe. However, we need to remember that this game is taking place on de_train, surely a map in favor of the Polish side, and also one of their usual picks. On the other hand Titan are back in their usual Limbo, and they are still kinda inconsistent and they didn't figure out how to deal with the late-game yet. Usually on Train they are decent, but overall kinda below the VP level, so we doubt we'll watch them taking more than 12 rounds or so. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of VP, and we agree on this, so (even if the percentages are a bit too skewed) we're oriented in attempting a Low+ bet on [Pasha] and friends.
http://csgo.guru/match/279!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6705!$coL!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.45!$0.27!$0.18!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Second match in a row on de_cache for Liquid, and honestly we're not expecting any huge surprises. Based mainly on the exceptional shows that Hiko and friends are used to providing on this map. However CompLexity are for sure a slightly tougher opponent compared to Conquest on Cache, and overall they've played it more regularly and with more consistent results. Additionally, they are featuring an extremely well-tuned teamplay lately, with quite a nice (and smart) set of strats. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch coL putting up a good show, and also a final score slightly closer than expected. Betting odds are rolling in favor of Liquid, and this is correct (and pretty obvious), but honestly the percentages are a bit too skewed and we believe we'll enjoy a kinda risky game. So we're slightly more prone to trying our luck with a ICB/Low bet on coL rather than risking an Avg bet on Liquid.

Today we'll likely enjoy something really similar, and SK could be able to take their revenge as well, according to how well they performed yesterday and to their recent pretty promising results. On the other hand, nothing really new to say about FlipSid3, their firepower isn't crazy high but they compensate with a smart way to play and good strats, so usually they always manage to offer good fights against T2/3 teams. About maps, there are good chances to watch de_cbble, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, Fsid3 should be slightly advantaged on Cobblestone while both Train and Overpass are mostly 50/50. Betting odds are a bit too skewed in favor of Bondik and friends, while real-world ones are more in the middle, so at our end we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on SK, with the hope to watch them playing as good as yesterday.

CompLexity aren't too bad, but in the past they've relied way too much on personal performances, instead of focusing on playing with a serious plan, which is extremely important on Inferno. On the other hand Luminosity usually keep this map for really important games, and they rarely spoiler it during their daily routine. So when they end on it, they are always a bit of a question mark, even if on paper they should have an edge over Semphis and friends. Betting odds are way too skewed, and even if LG have the advantage, we're a bit more oriented in playing with the percentages and attempting an ICB on coL, in order to take advantage of the 80/20 odds.

The last time we watched Renegades in (international) action was during the Crown's Invitational, where they managed to put up an amazing fight against VirtusPro during their above average performance. In the following local games they did well too, but as usual we don't really consider these kind of low-tier matches as extremely relevant. Surely they are moving here with a big question mark over their heads, but the Bo1 format can potentially help them in serving an unexpected upset. On the other hand ,CLG aren't currently enjoying their brightest of moments. They've had plenty of issues throughout the past weeks, and along with C9, they are one of the NA teams that have been less than impressive during the 'post-Cluj' time span. However, we need to remember that they usually step-up quite a bit in LAN games, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing better than what they've offered over the short-term. Betting odds are still extremely balanced, but at our end we feel safer in going Low on CLG rather than gambling with the Renegades mystery box.
http://csgo.guru/match/283!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6793!$Conquest!$coL!$coL!$0.5!$0.58!$-0.07999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$For our Group B elimination, both teams ended up here idue to very different situations. Conquest is waiting here after an extremely disappointing and discouraging entry game againt Cloud9, who looks to have woken up, much to the Canadians' misfortune. Conquest only managed to win a mere 4 rounds. After they way they've performed over recent weeks, this was a bit surprising. Since then, they've a little time to sit and think about it waiting for the chance to redeem themselves. CompLexity on the other hand, dont have much to hang their heads about. They fought to the bitter end after fumbling a lead to a strong Liquid team. Granted, it wasn't their best showing either, but both teams left that match knowing it could've just as easily gone the opposite way. So coL may be coming at Conquest aggressively, which should match their playstyle. This will hopefully lead to good show for us. Betting Odds are obviously trending infavor of CompLexity, which after the first matches we're inclined to believe. (but have since this was written, moved back in favor of Conquest) But on our end, we feel the marginal score Conquest lost by, was more attributed to C9 finally getting back to form, and less theirown failure. For this reason, we have real world odds at 50/50. So we're going Low on Conquest, with hopes of seeing them getting back to form
http://csgo.guru/match/284!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6824!$Na'Vi!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.43!$0.3!$0.13!$LOW RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite interesting an Bo3, and surely an interesting game since Natus Vincere usually care a bit more about StarSeries compared to other leagues. However, we cannot deny that GuardiaN and friends are currently experiencing a slump. In the past week the performances they've provided were way below their average potential. On the other hand, the updated Fnatic roster is still gonna be a bit inconsistent, but overall it looks promising and they should be advantaged on the extended map-pool. About the veto session, in our opinion we'll watch : de_inferno, de_train and de_dust2. If these will be the maps, Fnatic should be able to grab Inferno, while both Train and Dust2 are mostly 50/50. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Fnatic, and we agree on this since we find them a bit more consistent than NaVi. However, we wouldn't be surprised to watch the game going to all 3 maps. For this match-up we're a bit more oriented in playing our cards safely, so our pick is a Low+/Avg- bet on Fnatic.

Liquid are surely playing at a level amomgst the best out of NA. They had a decent lan performance over the weekend at IBP, but just didnt have enough to top CLoud9 in the Grand Finals, but respectably making it that far. Over the past few weeks they've played on-point in their online games, but had terrible lan outings at Cevo and Cluj. But this weekends' IBP showing should dimiss most hesitation concerning their lan play. CSGL on the other, really haven't done much of anything encouraging, and there seem to be some serious issues they're gonna need address. Possible roster changes may even be on the horizon. So we really don't expect to see them pose too much of a threat to nitr0 and friends. However, the two haven't faced each other before, so the absent point of reference could make this a closer contest than expected. Bettings Odds are naturally favoring Liquid, and for all the reasons above we're in agreement. While current percentages remain rewarding enough, our pick is an Average Bet on Liquid, with hopes of them carrying some extra momentum from a commendable weekend result.

Historically Dignitas never really focused a lot on de_overpass, even if now with the updated roster they could be slightly more dangerous, but honestly we don't believe they managed to find the time to re-focus on this map yet, and overall we're expecting a kinda pug-like gameplay from them. On the other hand Titan, are generally fine, but as we stated many times already they are quite prone to random slumps, so even if they are advantaged their performances aren't really written in stone. Betting odds are still quite balanced and pretty fine for going with a Low bet on the French/Belgian side, so we're oriented in taking this way as well.

Surely Virtus.Pro aren't facing their brightest moment, but we don't believe they'll face too many issues in rolling over FlipSid3 that today are also playing with a stand-in (Sharia instead of DavCost). As we anticipated, VP are currently on a quite bad short-term streak, but with so many top end tournaments about to go live in the next days/weeks (IEM San Jose &amp; DHW), this is kinda normal and not so relevant. However, we cannot say that the Poles are in a crazy high form, and compared to the rest of the top-tier teams, they're looking slightly below their average. About FlipSid3 as usual there isn't much to write about, in the past few days they didn't play bad at all, and surely their victory over EnvyUs is an interesting result, however we don't believe that without DavCost they'll be able to achieve exceptional stuff, in particular because they always been a really strats-dependent team. Both teams share exactly the same veto-pattern (as you can see in the graph below), so we'll probably watch : de_cache, de_mirage and de_inferno as maps. If the veto will go in this way, Fsid3 may grab Inferno, but Mirage and Cache should be in favor of VP. Betting odds are still decent for an Average bet on the Polish side, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/290!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6873!$Cloud9!$GAcademy!$Cloud9!$0.7!$0.92!$-0.22000000000000008!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not too much to say about the first of the bo3 stage of the RGN Pro Series. Cloud9, as expected, has absolutely no issues in advancing to the round. Coming into this event directly from the winners' circle after winning IBP Cup, C9 didnt skip a beat as they rolled through the first round of competition. In the their 3 Group B matches, Skadoodle and friends conceded a mere FIVE round between all three games combined. Even with the inferior opponents, this is very impressive. So they drew the Group C runner-up. Games Academy is below teir 3, and not a team we've covered prior to this event. So our point of reference is as limited as C9's. The Brazilians did show some good things against SKDC and then again in their somewhat surprising victory over CSGL. But honestly, neither of those are a measuring stick for what LG can offer. Betting odds are overwhelmingly in in favor of Cloud9, which of course is to be expected. This honestly isn't even a fair matchup, and with the percentages being a heavy as they are, this must be an automatic skip, and save your skins for the next round. But naturally, feel free to bet on C9 if you gotta pick.

Enemy probably are still a step ahead compared to Method, and Relyks and friends always managed to setup a bit more serious fights against the top-tier contenders, and even if they are still a bit shaky on the extended map-pool they have a tricky pattern of maps where they can be really dangerous. On the other hand Method are the NA team that focused more on teamplay and timings, but despite this is surely a good thing they are still affected by a chronic lack in firepower, and this causes them to suffer a lot against high end teams, or versus lineups sporting a more balanced output. About maps, we'll very likely watch: de_inferno, de_dust2 and de_cache. If the veto goes so, Inferno should be in favor of Enemy, while Method will likely take Cache, and Dust2 can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Enemy, and we agree on this since we believe that they are a bit more consistent and adaptive, but overall we're not talking about an huge edge. However our pick is a Low bet on Enemy.

Particularly since it features Gamers2 who in the past weeks have turned into one of the hotter trending European teams, following their great performance at DH Cluj; and CLG who are currently looking for some glory after a couple of pretty disappointing weeks. During that time they failed to impress at both the iBP Cup and RGN Championship (to be honest they are only playing this event because EnvyUs decided to step back due flight &amp; securty issues). The Bo3 format is surely in favor of G2, the EU mix finally started rolling well on the extended map-pool, and in their current state, they're surely way more dangerous than CLG. However we should keep in mind that Maikelele and friends took a quite long break just before this event, and they haven't been playing any official matches for about a week. This is surely something of relevance, especially since they are facing teams that have been playing on a daily basis throughout the entire month. So we're oriented in believing that G2 could be a bit rusty, and not quite on par with their most recent outings, so their entry games may be slightly closer than expected. As for maps, there are good chances of watching: de_cache, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto goes so, CLG may grab Train, while G2 should be a step ahead on Cache, leaving Mirage which is going to be slightly in their favor as well. Betting odds are currently way too skewed and mostly nonsense, obviously CLG has failed pretty hard over the short-term, but basically G2 didn't play at all, and data older than 2-3 weeks should be considered very carefully when we talk about International matches involving two teams that never faced each other. We're absolutely confident that G2 are advantaged, but with these percentages, the smartest thing to do is probably to play the odds and go with an ICB on CLG.
http://csgo.guru/match/296!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6973!$G2!$TSM!$TSM!$0.42!$0.34!$0.07999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We're a little more than half way through IEM San Jose, with the challenging single elimination bracket, we now know the first teams to advance through the Quarter Finals. The semi-finals will begin with probably not the most interesting of matchups, but one that might be a closer fight than might appear at first. Gamers2 has actually been rolling along for a little while now, and kinda surprisingly make fairly quick work of making CLG the first team to go home. In that contest, G2 only needed 2 maps to wrap things up, despite a close first map that needed OT to decide. But on Cache, the Europeans stepped it up a level, and quickly made it a lop-sided affair. Anyway things won't be getting any easier for them moving forward, but the streak will certainly get put to the test. Menahwile TSM wasn't quite as convincing in the entry game, but while G2 was handling a shaky CLG crew, the Danish were fighting it out with the hottest NA team in C9, who came here directly after winning back to back lan events (IBP &amp; RGN). So we can surely say G2 didn't have the same degree of opposition as TSM, but the Danes still manged C9 to their will to advance to the semi-finals. As we mentioned on the first, TSM are the probable favorites to win the whole event, and their 1st round performance didn't give any reason to waiver on that expectation. But they could be running into G2 at the right time for TSM to be really tested. As we look at veto, we expect to see de_dust2, de_train, and de_mirage, and should the selection follow this Dust2 will make for quite an interesting map. TSM surely has greater experience here, but G2 has put some of better shows against strong EU teams here (TSM excluded). So TSM has just a slightly advantage here, but this may be the key map if G2 aims to upset. Train on the other hand gives advantge to G2, since TSM really don't play it often, nor have they had the best results here. Leaving Mirage, which also favors TSM, but we should point in recent weeks G2 has shown some improvments here the few times they've played it. So overall, we might be looking at quite a decent match. Betting Odds are expectedly favoring TSM, especially when veiwing the tilt of results when these two have played, but the percentages certainly remain rewarding still for our pick for TSM appearance in the finals. But we also caution keeping the value Low since G2 has made a habit of winning some unexpected contests.

After such a crazy week of RGN scheduling and exhausting coverage, this single elimination of quite relevant teams has already been narrowed down from 8 to the final 2. As we stated already on Twitter, we're a little bit disappointed to see this Grand Final decided in a Bo3, and we would've happily swapped the Talent Showmatch for a full fledged Bo5, and honestly it would've been easily achieved based on the extra time gained courtesy of all these matches ending with decisive 2-0 scores (in the past days as well). Anyway we'll still experience a nice Final so not much to complain, talking about the match it self, we're not so surprised to see TSM hitting the Grand Final. The Danes' extremely high form was fully clear from the very beginning, and even if they started their Semi-Final against Gamers2 a bit slow and not quite as focused. They've quickly recovered and unloaded their all their firepower, stormed the misfortunate G2 with convincingly heavy scores (16-7 &amp; 16-6). On the other hand Natus Vincere put their brains to good use, and yet again they managed to overtake an opponent featuring quite high firepower by using smart calls and taking advantage of the tactical weaknesses of Liquid. This became quite clear on de_dust2, where they managed to impressively comeback, however we also need to note that Hiko and friend made a couple of critical mistakes in the money management, and they went for a couple of force-buy that they could have avoided. But well, this is a common (bad) habit for many NA top teams, so we're not too surprised. Overall TSM are obviously advantaged, and without a doubt more solid on the extended map-pool compared to NaVi, and at our end we're expecting to watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train as maps. Should the veto go so, TSM should be advantaged on Overpass, while both Dust2 and Train can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of TSM, and as stated above we're not surprised and do agree on this trend, so even if percentages aren't really amazing we're oriented in picking a Low+ bet on Dupreeh and friends.
http://csgo.guru/match/298!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6985!$Penta!$E-Frag!$E-Frag!$0.45!$0.36!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not a bad low-tier match, and probably we'll experience a quite enjoyable show since the winner of this game will qualify for the Red Dot Invitational, obviously not the most prestigious cup out there, but still a good mid-tier event that both teams really need in order to get some extra exposure. Penta in the short-term improved a bit, but honestly they are still floating at kind of low level compared to the full potential of this roster, and looks like they are missing a real leader that can put some order in their gameplay. As plus they didn't play too much in the past month, and their form isn't extremely high. On the other hand, E-Frag are without a doubt more glued than Penta, but still widely inconsistent, in particular on the extended map-pool. Additionally we need to remember that their performance in the GameAgents Grand Final as one of the worst bits of CS we've watched in the past weeks. And here they basically failed on the whole line, despite the Bo5 format was surely forgiving for underdogs (a plain 3-0 with scores like 16-9/16-4/16-11 is quite heavy). Talking about the current game, there are good chances to watch de_dust2, de_cache and de_inferno as maps. If the veto will go so, EFrag should be advantaged on Inferno and slightly on Dust2, while Cache is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on EFrag, so we're oriented in taking this path, with the hope to watch the Bulgarians a bit more focused than during their game against FSid3.
http://csgo.guru/match/299!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7003!$VP!$Legacy!$VP!$0.7!$0.94!$-0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Opening match of DHW for what should be an entertaining finish to FaceIt Season 3.Theres really not much to say about this game since there is no International data regarding Legacy yet, and even if we watched a lil of them during the FaceIt AU Qualifier (where they did quite fine, and have been a bit lucky too, due to the 4-way Tie). But this isn't enough in order appropriate assess their strengths and weaknesses to give them proper placement. Overall we don't believe Virtus.pro will face any huge issue in rolling over Legacy. The Poles should be fairly better on the whole map-pool, so the Bo1 format won't be an issue either. Anyway, Betting Odds are surprisingly decent for going with VP, mostly due to the Aussies being quite the question mark. Additionally, Snax and friends are kinda used in slumping a bit during the entry match of lan events, but honestly we don't think we'll watch anything surprising. So our pick is an Avg bet on VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/300!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7022!$SKDC!$WinterFox!$WinterFox!$0.5!$0.36!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$As we get ready for DreamHack Winter, we do have one match of note on the schedule for tonight. Kind of an interesting low-end matchup for a best of three StarSeries contest. SKDC certainly isn't one the more relevant low teired teams, but gained some exposure during the RGN Pro Series. But more importantly they gained some much needed experience battling some of the more established and notable teams of the scene. However they didn't perform too well in their recent relevant matches, and are surely a good ways off from competing with the upper T3+ teams, but considering some of the recent bumps we've seen from their NA opponents here, we could see this game go to third map. The recent bumps of Winterfox just mentioned, were largely evident during their brief appearance at RGN. Granted, it was one of the very first events for the currently composed Wfx roster, but honestly we expected a little bit more from them than what they brought. Especially after a respectable entry game victory over Torqued. But since that win, Wfx's struggles have been on full display, even in their last online match vs 3sUP. So this should make for a good opponent for them to try and rebuild some confidence. Since these two teams, as currently composed, have no real match history to reference the veto will likely be driven by whichever maps both teams played well together in practice. So theres no basis to guess the final selection. Ordinarily we'd expect Wfx to be able to grab by a possible 2-0 sweep, but their recent troubles will likely see them lose at least one map, and even a chance to blow the contest all together, putting real-world odds at a 50/50 toss-up. But on our end, we believe the raw team skill of Wfx should be able to prevail, so our pick is a Low bet on them.

TSM looked really impressive so far, and their show on de_overpass against Liquid was simply mind blowing. Not just because of the 16-0 final score, but also because they achieved it as T, something not really easy to do on anv heavily CT-sided map such as Ovp. On the other hand, Virtus.pro didn't sweat too much against the Aussies, and even if Legacy surely put up a better fight than Liquid, we don't think that VP used any of their aces in the hole. So we believe we'll watch the Poles step up a lot in this game, in order to attempt and qualify without the need of additional matches. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of TSM and this is accurate since the Danes are looking really in form at the moment. But surely percentages shouldn't be so skewed. Anyway, lately VP have been quite unreliable, so we're oriented in playing it safe and going for a Low+ bet on TSM (but we wouldn't be surprised to watch close scores).
http://csgo.guru/match/303!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7046!$VP!$Liquid!$VP!$0.55!$0.73!$-0.17999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Group A decider, and surely quite an interesting show. Liquid are moving here already well warmed up thanks to their victory over Legacy achieved in the morning. Overall, quite an enjoyable elimination match to watch and we can also say that the North American side had to sweat a bit in order to tame the Aussies. On the other hand Virtus.pro had to deal with a quite shaky Day1, and after the entry victory over Legacy, they had hard times against TSM, despite they were playing on a map (de_mirage) where usually they always been really consistent. However, the Danes aren't an easy opponent to deal with, particularly on LAN, so the 13-16 final score still shows some progresses for VP that lately are slumping a bit. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch : de_overpass, de_mirage and de_cache. If the veto will go so, Mirage should be in favor of VP, while both Cache and Overpass are mostly 50/50. Betting odds are currently still acceptable for going Low+/Avg- on [Pasha] and friends, so we're oriented in taking this path, even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch this game hitting map3.
http://csgo.guru/match/307!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7062!$Fnatic!$LG!$Fnatic!$0.55!$0.68!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is going to be one of the craziest and totally unexpected Grand-Finals of the year. Nobody was really expecting such a show by Luminosity and what they managed to put up is simply amazing and outstanding. Accomplishing what they did against these Top tier teams is just unbelievable. And even if they are joining the Grand Final as underdogs, we're all now fully aware of their potential. And in our hearts, we would be extremely happy to watch a 'cindarella story' such as this one come to fruition. On the other hand, Fnatic know how to deal with the Grand-Finals stage. They are surely way more experienced than LG, and they are striving to show that they are still the team to beat. Additionally, winning in front of their own audience is obviously something they really want to achieve. About maps, we believe we'll watch de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train. If the veto will go so, Fnatic should have an edge on Train, while both Dust2 and Inferno are going to be 50/50, based on what Luminosity displayed so far. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on JW and friends, and at our end we're oriented in taking this way. But honestly, at this point, anything can happen. So just follow your heart and enjoy one of the most beautiful matches of the year.
http://csgo.guru/match/308!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7083!$TSM!$Dignitas!$TSM!$0.6!$0.87!$-0.27!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Second Bo3 in a row for Dignitas, just like the previous game they are using Zonic instead of Tenzki, but instead of G2 this time they are facing the full TSM lineup, and as we observed many times in the past they never really managed to take the upper hand against their local and high-tiered rivals. Overall there are good chances to watch this game ending with a plain 2-0 in favor of Dupreeh and the gang, TSM despite the issues they had against Luminosity during the FACEIT Finals are still an extremely consistent team, and we highly doubt we'll watch them losing a Bo3 where they are basically advantaged on every single map, however we wouldn't be surprised to watch them 'overlooking' a bit the entry one, but in the worst case they should be able to close the game 2-1. About maps, we'll likely watch de_mirage, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, TSM will likely grab Mirage and train, while Overpass could be a bit closer than expected, in particular if played as first. Betting odds are already pretty skewed and not really rewarding, so we suggest to keep a close eye on them and eventually just skip if the percentages hit values around 90/10. If you want to bet anyway, our pick is obviously TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/309!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7086!$CLG!$coL!$CLG!$0.6!$0.61!$-0.010000000000000009!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$The only game on our NA schedule for this evening. A matchup we've seen many times before, but not the most interesting of matches considering the rut both teams are currently in. CLG has been struggling with inconsistency over the last few months, and looked to have started to turn things around towards the end of CEVO S8, but have since managed a run of disappointing events (especially their Lan ones), where they found themselves eliminated earlier than expected. They have the potential, but their veto choices haven't always put them in the best position for victory, so theres reason for hesitation on CLG picks. CompLexity on the other hand, have also had their series of ups and downs. They looked to start November with a series of wins, and their form appeared encouraging, including a wins over CLG and C9. However, that spark was short lived, and they too suffered a rather steep decline in performances as the month progressed. Now they too look to start the new month a high note. But we should also mention, Valens departed from the team, and coL will be using Warden as standin this evening. So we're not expecting too much from them till they can solidify the roster. Since this is an RGN Freedom Cup contest, the usual bo3 will apply. Though the coL lineup change 'may' affect their map selection, we're anticipating seeing de_train, de_cbble, and de_cache for the maps. Should the veto go this way, CLG should be able to grab Cobblestone, while coL should take Cache if it goes to the third map. While Train is typically a 50/50 map, the coL roster change, we feel, gives the edge slightly towards CLG. Betting Odds are trending in favor of CLG, which we're inclined to agree. Historically, coL has performed better than CLG in their head to head games, but we think the absence of Valens will negatively impact this pattern. And so our pick in Low+ Bet on CLG.

On paper this is a pure 50/50 game, both teams should be kinda aligned and the Fenchmen always had some issues in dealing with GuardiaN and friends and overall they never really managed to understand the (messy) NaVi mid-game, that honestly doesn't really follow any real pattern but most of times is simply improvised and a bit momentum based. About maps, according to out Veto graph, there are good chances to watch : de_dust2, de_train and de_mirage. Both teams always followed a quite similar set of maps so we expect kinda even performances on all of them, with the only exception of Mirage that is generally a good map for NaVi but in this case we need to note that they rarely managed to play it properly against EnvyUs. Betting odds are skewed in favor of the French side, mostly because the previous H2Hs, but real-world percentages are right in the middle, so we don't see any reason for not attempting a Low bet on NaVi in order to take advantage of the more rewarding values.
http://csgo.guru/match/313!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7166!$Conquest!$NME!$Conquest!$0.58!$0.76!$-0.18000000000000005!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The only match on our NA schedule tonight, the StarSeries XIV Upper Bracket Quarter Finals, featuring two mid-teired teams who've shown promise over the last few months. Conquest, as we've mentioned on a number of occasions are one of the more exciting NA teams to watch, with their distinctive aggressive playstyle, and have always come through with some entertaining shows. The past two quarters has offered continuous signs of progress, including their impressive run to the CEVO S8 Finals, where they really established themselves as a credible NA threat. However, their quick exit from the IBP Cup (single elimination bracket) greatly slowed their momentum and lowered expectations. As for the StarSeries though, the Canadians have faired well in the Bo3 format, locking in their position undefeated at the top of NA Group B. On the other hand Enemy has shown some encouraging things, but overall haven't progressed as well as the Canadians. They've had a little time off since we've last seen them, but this might not be the match they need to get back on track. Relyks and friends rely heavily on teamplay since they don't sport the firepower some of the higher tiered NA teams do. But this hasn't been enough to edge out any wins in the past versus Conquest, and honestly we're not expecting this pattern to deviate today either, particularly on the extended map-pool. For those maps, we expect to see de_inferno, de_mirage, and de_overpass. But generally Conquest should be advantaged on all three, so we wouldn't be surprised to see ShahZaM and co. grab this in a 2-0 sweep. But even if NME can manage to grab one map, we don't believe Conquest will fall short on any more than that. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on Conquest, so we're oriented in going this way, even if we suggest keeping an eye on percentages, in case they move below the profitability threshold.
http://csgo.guru/match/314!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7183!$SK!$TSM!$SK!$0.35!$0.07!$0.27999999999999997!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$We begin today's FBM S5 Finals with an all-Danish Lower Bracket head to head, following the disappointing 0-2 losses that both teams suffered in their respective bracket semi-finals yesterday. As we mentioned plenty of times already, over the past few weeks, SK has improved a lot, but actually they still lack of experience and looks like they still have issues in messing with T1 teams. This kind of issues showed up yesterday in a very disappointing game against NiP, where they fell 16-2 and 16-6. This could be largely attributed to their lack of lan experience, which seemed quite evident through both maps. And to be honest, the Danes just looked confused right from the start, beginning with the veto. Considering their oppponent, SK didn't put themselves in a great position with Cache as the first map. So if they have any hope of turning the tide, they'll need to approach today's contest much wiser than yesterday. Meanwhile, exTSM (the players formerly of TeamSoloMid) may have been burdened by the off-screen drama, on their way to their own decisive defeat at the hands of the other swedes remaining in the finals, Fnatic. The Danes weren't even able to manage reaching the third map as well. However, unlike SK, TSM put up a more respectable fight, at least in the first half of their games. But Fnatic is obviously rolling along strong, and the current form of Dupreeh and co. was simply not enough to hang with the Swedes. Regardless, we do want to commend the Danish group for still grinding ahead in competition despite everything they're currently dealing with. As far as the veto goes, we're expecting to watch de_inferno, de_mirage, and de_overpass. The experience of TSM, particularly in lan events, surely favors them throughout the map-pool compared to SK. If this is how the veto unfolds, SK's best chance to grab a map will likely be Overpass, mainly since their Danish counterparts have struggled there a bit more lately than in the past. But, even though TSM aren't currently performing at their usual level, they should still be able to take the victory over SK. And so we're in agreement with the current Betting Odds that are expectedly skewed well in favor of TSM. Provided the percentages remain rewarding enough for an Average Bet, they're our pick for this contest.
http://csgo.guru/match/315!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7211!$E-Frag!$Titan!$Titan!$0.4!$0.27!$0.13!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an extremely relevant match, and we're not expecting any real surprise out of it. Surely Titan haven't play a lot in the short-term, and even if they managed to grab a victory over EnvyUs a couple of days ago, we don't suggest to take that result as extremely relevant, since local games always follow a particular pattern. However, on the other hand E-frag aren't the most scary opponent out there. Even if they displayed a decent capability in setting up good fights against high-tiered teams, we don't really believe we'll watch them taking a whole Bo3 against the Frenchmen. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, we wouldn't be surprised to watch EFrag setting up a good show on Overpass, but Shox and friends should have a clear edge on both Dust2 and Inferno. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on the French side, so we're oriented in playing safe and sticking with Titan.

But there's really not too much to discuss regarding this mixed T2-T3 matchup. Vexed hasn't been playing many relevant matches over the past few weeks. But in their games versus T3 teams the Polish side have mostly performed on par to their ranking. On the past quarter they've established themselves as a solid third tier team, but absent of any significant firepower, however we need to underline that they always step-up a lot when facing T1 teams, and we shouldn't forget that they already managed to hit 2 Majors, so they cannot be underestimated. As for APM, there's a chance, they could manage to grab one of the 4 playoff spots out of Group B. Meanwhile Gamers2 are likely one of the locks to qualify for the APM playoffs, but this will only be their 2nd game out of the 7 to qualify, so they'll have a busier APM schedule in the short-term. As for the recent action, G2 has been a pretty decent and played vs higher leveled teams (including a 2-0 sweep of ex-TSM and 6 straight wins over Virtus.Pro). So they're amongst hotter T2 teams. As for this match, G2 are obviously the superior crew, and have greater strength and experience throughout the extended map-pool. Additionally, we should remember that Rain is back, so this restores their full potential. Based on the Veto pattern, theres good chances we'll see de_dust2 and de_train. But regardless of the selection, we're confident Maikelele and cast will walk away with no less with a tie, so an Avg pick on G2 should be kinda safe. However, with the current Betting Odds already quite bad and still decreasing, we suggest to keep an eye on the percentages and eventually skip if values hit the 90/10 threshold.

Mousesports have been quite inconsistent over the last quarter, and seem to go on small runs of wins and losses. They haven't been in action for about a week, but looked decent in their last game versus CSGL, but overall we aren't talking about a super relevant opponent and we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Germans struggling a bit in the first map due the low amount of training. Additionally the impact of the new Update shouldn't be underestimated since the changes on the M4/AK spray threshold may force some players in adjusting a bit. On the other hand Hellraisers are kinda inconsistent, and despite the great show they managed to setup against VP, they still faced serious issues in messing with Dignitas. So overall they're a team following a pretty unpredictable pattern. Betting odds are slightly in favor of Mouz, but still decent for sticking with a Low bet on them, even if the chance to see just a Tie is pretty high, in particular if we'll watch de_overpass and de_cbble as maps.

Since about a week after Cluj, EnvyUs have been challenged with issues of inconsistency, but for their entry game with Liquid, the Frenchman surely look to be in good form to conlude the year. KennyS and gang dominated the Americans on Cache right from the first half. On Cobblestone, the competetition was a bit more aligned, but NV never at any point lost control of the game. A fairly quick 2-0 sweep, and the French move to the winner's circle to face the fiercely rolling Swedes. Fnatic has obviously been on fire lately, coming off a fresh FBM championship, they handled Conquest in decisive fashion, lead by the charge of Olofmeister on Mirage. And then on Inferno, the Swedes steamrolled through the first 14 rds, and mixed things up on the buy-in when they all went with the auto-shotgun. However, a map shy of match point, the trollish move was unsucessful, and Conquest finally offered some resistence taking the following 9 rounds. But too little, too late. And now the top two teams in the World will battle it out for the first spot in the semi-finals. There's no love loss between these two, with a rather extensive match history, for today's bout we're expecting to see de_train, de_inferno, and de_cbble. Should the veto go this way, NV should be advantaged on Train, while Fnatic should've an edge on Inferno, leaving Cobblestone capable of going either way. Betting Odds trending in favor of Fnatic, and we're of similar opinion. Percentages are still rewarding enough for a Low Bet on them, but keep in mind this is not an elimination match so they may play a bit more conservative to save some things for the end stage.

Overall they looked a bit revitalized, for sure a bit fresher compared to their latest kinda disappointing shows. So we can say that they are on the good path for regaining their momentum. On the other hand Natus Vincere had to work slightly harder in order to take home a victory over Luminosity. GuardiaN and friends managed to grab de_dust2 pretty smoothly, but they experienced more issues with Inferno, where the Brazilians managed to hit the Overtime. Anyway the OT featured a NaVi dominance and closed pretty quickly. This is basically a pure 50/50 game, we wouldn't be surprised to watch the 3rd map kicking-in or even require OTs. Both teams are fully capable of grabbing a victory, so we're talking about the riskiest game of the today's batch. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto goes so, both teams faced these maps plenty of times and they are all pretty balanced. However, former TSM should have a little edge on Dust2, while Overpass should be in favor of NaVi. Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are still sitting in the middle, but at our end we're oriented in gambling on the return of Dupreeh and friends, so our pick is a Low bet on ex-TSM.

Fnatic surely struggled against EnVyUs more than we were expecting, but since the Frenchmen are currently the 2nd team in the world, their performance is fully understandable, even if we were hoping to see at least a 3rd map. However, Liquid are a whole different story, they had issues in moving over Conquest, and with a slightly more effort Shahzam and co. could have kept the match on an even tighter score. Additionally we don't believe that playing with a stand-in can take Liquid too far, in particular against a team such as Fnatic. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_inferno, de_cache and de_mirage. If the veto goes so the Swedes should be fairly advantaged on all of them, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch a 2-0 sweep. Betting odds already turned into trash. The current percentages aren't really profitable and they'll likely get even worse in the next hours. If you really want to pick a side, the way to go is Fnatic, but you should seriously consider a skip because final values will be around 90/10.

Yesterday, Luminosity failed to impress against Natus Vincere, and even if they managed to reach the Overtime on de_inferno, they still failed in bringing the game to map 3. However, now they have another shot, and with the fear of going out early we're sure, that the Brazilians will try to provide their very best, in order to show that what they put up @ FACEIT Finals wasn't a fluke. On the other hand, NaVi failed pretty hard against ex-TSM, and they finished both maps kinda far from the OT threshold, overall we were expecting something more from GuardiaN and friends. Especially after the convincing show against LG. As a team, NaVi are heavily momentum based, so they aren't an easy team to predict nor one to face. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch them having issues against LG, even though just a day ago, they managed to take them down in a quick 2-0 sweep. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph we'll watch: de_dust2, de_inferno and de_overpass. If this is how it goes, NaVi should have an edge on Dust2 while both Inferno and Overpass are basically pure 50/50. Betting odds are obviously skewed in favor of NaVi, while real-world ones are a bit more balanced. At our end we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low- bet on LG, mostly because we believe that Luminosity can provide a slightly better show than what they displayed so far.

Fnatic moved here pretty seamlessly, of course they had some stutters against EnVyUs on Friday, but then they easily dismissed Liquid and ex-TSM with a couple of quick 2-0 sweeps, and advanced to the last stage. Now with a wide knowledge on the extended map-pool, and basically no must-veto maps, they have serious chances of taking home yet another trophy, potentially the third in a row after FACEIT and FBM. On the other hand Natus Vincere are slightly unexpected Grand Finalist. Right after their Cluj performance, GuardiaN &amp; friends faced their fair share of issues, in regaining form and motivation. They didn't enter ESL/ESEA Finals as huge favorites. Both exTSM and EnvyUs were ranked better; but when nobody expected it, NaVi always showed up. And their double victory over LG and the domination over EnVyUs clearly indicated that they've always had an ace up their sleeve. However, their consistency isn't quite on par with Fnatic, and there are several maps where they sometimes experience stutters, so they'll enter the Grand Final as underdogs. About the maps, Inferno and Cobblestone should be clearly advantage of the Swedes, while most of the others can easily go both ways, with Overpass to be vetoed. Betting odds are trending in favor of the Flusha's team, and this is correct since they have a fair advantage, so we're oriented in agreeing with this trend and we suggest a Low+ pick on Fnatic.

Luminosity has hit some shaky times sinece their incredible push at the FACEIT S3 Finals, where the Brazilians bumped off some EU's best, one after the next, but Fnatic ended that run at the grand finals. Since then, LG competed at the ESL ESEA Finals, only managing to beat CLG, and fall twice to NaVi. And now they'll look to get back to winning ways against some fellow NA competition. compLexity made their last relevant appearance in Northern Arena 2015, where they were swept by CLG in the Grand Final. Prior to that, coL hasnt been able to restore their form months past, and has repeatedly struggled with creating any consistency. However, this will likely not be the match they need to get back to the win column. On paper, LG is the superior team, particularly in a game featuring the extended map-pool. For this Bo3 we're expecting to see de_inferno, de_cbble, and de_dust2, and honestly, the Brazilians should be advantaged on all 3 maps so we wouldn't be surprsied to see them grab this straight 2-0. Betting Odds are expected well skew in favor in LG, which we surely agree with. As long as percentages remaining rewarding for a pick, a Low+/Avg- Bet on on LG is our pick.

Overall this is a change that we're not sure will pay off on the long term, surely Spiidi and Nex used to form a pretty dangerous duo, but dismissing Gob B, one of the legendary masterminds of the CS scene is surely a quite risky move. Anyway, talking about the current game, CSGL are cruising in troubled waters since a while, their short-term results (against serious opponents) haven't been really exciting and they always struggled on games featuring the extended map-pool, so even if they could be able to take advantage of the Mouz's roster changes, we don't believe they'll manage to take more than a map. About the veto session, we believe we'll watch: de_cache, de_mirage and de_dust2. If these will be the maps, Mouz should have an edge on both Cache and Dust2, while we wouldn't be surprised to watch CSGL taking Mirage. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on Mouz, so we're oriented in following this path as well.

Gamers2 had to sweat more than expected in dismissing Arcade in their entry game. Overall, they looked a bit rusty and slow, in addition to the fact they've not played too much in December, could potentially be a real issue. Especially since G2 has a roster which historically has faced serious consistency problems with kinda random peaks/drops. On the other hand, Dignitas didn't move here with ease either, their game against SK was extremely close, including a pretty long Overtime as well. But honestly, this isn't really surprising, SK has stepped up a lot lately, and recently Dignitas was dealing with roster changes, so now they're probably going to need a bit of extra time in order to regain their full form. Talking about maps, we believe we'll watch: de_inferno, de_train, de_mirage. If the veto goes this way, Inferno should be in favor of G2, while we wouldn't be surprised to watch Dignitas take Train, and Mirage should mostly be an even contest. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Maikelele and friends, and this is quite understandable since they certainly feature higher potential, however we don't suggest to underestimate the Danes, because they can definitely deliver a good fight. At our end we're oriented in picking a Low bet on G2, mostly because they are slightly more reliable in relevant games, but overall we're talking about quite a risky match that can easily go both ways.
http://csgo.guru/match/330!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7515!$WinterFox!$Splyce!$Splyce!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Very slow week as we creep ever closer to the holidays, but we do have something to view on the NA schedule this evening, and actually kind of an interesting contest, paricularly since these two just competed several days ago. WinterFox is actually playing with more consistency than we've seen from them over the past few months. Recently their spot for ESEA S3 was in jeopardy, but Desi and co. pulled it together to retain their seat with a win over the challenging Denial. And then they faced off with today's opponent in their Group A Gameshow GSC contest, in pursuit of claiming 1 of the 2 spots for the NA region for the $200K Lan event in February, where Wfx managed a decisive 2-0 sweep. They continued their streak in another GSC match (vesus a subT3 team) to remain at the top of their Group. Not that it was the most relevant match, but the important aspect is Wfx has continued playing with some level of consistency, which as mentioned, has been one of their greatest issues in recent weeks. So this match should be a good measuring stick of that progress. SPLYCE on the other hand, has made a push recently to splash their way into the relevant side of the NA scene. There looked to be some possibility of progressing in that direction, following an impressive sweep of CLG in the Road to Vegas qualifier. However, NME ended that quickly in the Semis. Meanwhile, SPLYCE also had an opportuniy to earn a spot in the Season 3 of ESEA, but a struggling Method squad wasn't prepared to give up their spot, and SPLYCE was even able to grab 1 map. So overall, the once hopeful potential of SPLYCE has lost momentum, and remains T3, and they've additionally parted ways Stewie2k, so they'll be playing with a standin today. With regards to todays match, this is CounterPit, so the usual nonsense Bo2 format applies. There's limited data to reference, but there's good chances of seeing de_cbble and de_cache. But honestly, considering the above mentioned variables pertitnent to these teams currently, Wfx should be able keep their progress going and grab the win here today. Even worst case scenario, we'll see a tie. So our pick is in line with Current Betting Odds, for a Low bet on WinterFox.
http://csgo.guru/match/331!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7574!$CSGL!$OG!$OG!$0.45!$0.59!$-0.13999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the E-League 'Road to Vegas' Grand-Final and unquestionably the most interesting match-up of the day. This game will be played on a stage set up at CES 2016, currently taking place in Las Vegas, NV. The one-shot event featuring a $50,000 prize-pool, together with a spot into the upcoming E-League for the winner, is surely quite a juicy opportunity for two teams that finished the year removed from Major placements. Talking about OpTiC, it's important to remember that they are just the old Conquest squad, one of the biggest revelations of the NA scene and one of the teams we quite enjoyed the most during the past Quarter. On LAN they don't have much experience yet, but overall they are one of the few North American lineups that moved through the Xmas shuffle without performing roster changes. This is surely something in their favor, since they can just keep rolling thanks to the expertise and experience they accrued in the past months. As we already mentioned, they are a pretty peculiar team, their play style is way different compared most of the NA teams around, and could be really tricky to counter for EU opponents as well, in particular against teams favoring a passive gameplay. On the other hand CSGL had an year full of ups and downs. Well mostly downs. Since they disappointed for pretty much 3/4 of the last season (even though they finally woke up in late 2015), and frequently failed to put up threatening shows even against relatively low-tier opponents. As comparison, we can easily say that Vexed had way more solid shows than CSGL, and we're prone to considering them the 3rd team in a Polish-only regional ranking (the direct match played in late Dec doesn't really matter). However, there are surely maps where they are pretty tricky to face, in particular Mirage. So with some luck and a good veto at their end, there are good chances to watch the Poles taking the match on map3. Talking about maps, in our opinion we'll watch, de_cbble, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto goes so (and OpTiC will fail to ban Mirage as they should), there are pretty high chances to watch a quite balanced and kinda risky game. On Cobblestone the American side should have an edge, while CSGL should grab Mirage, and Train is going to be mostly a toss-up. Betting odds are currently slightly skewed in favor of CSGL, mostly because in these kind of games the faith on EU teams is generally higher, however OpTiC aren't the average NA opponent. But way more smarter and prepared on the extended map-pool, so they are our pick, and at our end we are oriented in giving them a 5% edge over the Poles, but we suggest to stay Low in value.

Certainly not as exciting as the show we just saw finish up in Vegas, but may potentially be a bit of a fairly balanced match-up, so we're hopeful for something entertaining to end the day. SPLYCE as we've touched on underwent a full overhaul during the holiday break, now composed of the former 3sUP lineup. They looked decent in first match under the new banner in draw versus WinterFox. Prior to that, as 3sUP, they didn't have some their best stuff going, so the a fresh start with new organization may be good for them. Meanwhile, trying gain some traction in Tier3, SKDC is just gaining experience, and surely didn't finish 2015 as they hoped, as far as matches against relevant teams. So they'll likely be eager to begin the year with a splash as well. After all, we're coming out the holiday break and NA shuffle, and they're amongst some of the few to remain the same, which is worth noting. Betting odds are well skewed in favor of SPLYCE, which is to be expected considering the experience advantage they hold. On our end, we're in agreement here, and don't see SPLYCE losing more than 1 map. But these percentages aren't really rewarding enough, so we'd suggest considering a skip. If you want to pick though, Low on SPLYCE is the way to go

However, Device and friends had to fight way harder than expected in order to dismiss the French side, and the first two maps finished in OT (1st one in favor of TQM &amp; the 2nd to the Frenchmen), with Titan bringing up one of their AAA games (something we haven't seen in a while), and ex-TSM forced to provide a top-notch show on Dust2. A map where Titan has always been quite tricky. Its worth noting that TQM had to deal with connection issues and high-latency during a good part of the evening. So this surely affected their performance, and without a doubt it will keep creating troubles for the Danes in this current game too. On the other hand, EnVyUs didn't show any real flaws against Dignitas, and they rolled over them in a clean 2-0 sweep. The kind of show we're quite used to seeing from them since the Nordic team always displayed serious limits in battling Tier1 opponents. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_inferno, de_mirage and de_cache. If the veto goes this way, Inferno should be quite balanced, while Mirage is going to be mostly random (since both teams never really excelled on it), and Cache should be in favor of the French side. At our end, after watching all the struggles that ex-TSM experienced against Titan, we're prone to picking a Low bet on EnVyUs, and the current betting odds are still decent for taking this path as well.

Plus we currently find them both playing kinda inconsistent and not too reliable. However, this is a Bo2 match, and generally when two teams with similar issues meet, we typically see an outcome of a plain Tie. Anyway, about Vexed, we just want to remember that they generally step-up a bit when facing decent opponents, so we wouldn't be surprised to see the Polish side playing properly. Even though they aren't really solid on the extended map-pool yet. On the other hand, FlipSid3 are surely a step ahead skill-wise. But lately their gameplay is overly messy, and not really as sharp as they used to be in the past Quarters. Basically, without DavCost, their executions have turned a bit slow and predictable, when they previously had a good set of maps where they were able to setup quite great fights. Betting odds are slightly skewed in favor of Fsid3, but still decent for going Low on them, so we're oriented in sticking with Markeloff and friends for our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/342!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7704!$Na'Vi!$LG!$LG!$0.55!$0.64!$-0.08999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty exciting match-up, and surely one we don't get to watch frequently. Luminosity managed to grab a pretty impressive victory over Gamers2 in their SLTV Finals entry game. The Brazilian side looked a good step ahead of G2 throughout the whole match, and they displayed some strong confidence, even on a tricky map such as Train. LG already faced Natus Vincere in December, during the ESL/ESEA Finals, and in that occasion we enjoyed a pretty tight game that ended on map3. This time there are good chances to watch an even closer game, considering the form displayed by Luminosity looks kinda high. On the other hand, Natus Vincere took down the Chinese side CyberZen without sweating much, but prior this game the CIS mix didn't really play any other contests, and just like Fnatic, they are moving here after a month-long break. So honestly we've doubts about their current form as well. Talking about maps, we believe we'll watch: de_overpass, de_train and de_cbble. If the veto goes so, Cobblestone should be in favor of NaVi, while LG will likely grab Train leaving Overpass which may go both ways. Betting odds are skewed in favor of NaVi, but after the performance that LG managed to set up we believe that real-world percentages are moreso balanced, so we're oriented in risking a bit and going for a Low bet on Luminosity.
http://csgo.guru/match/343!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7728!$QM!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.52!$0.45!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite a great Group B decider, and surely a match that could offer a few good surprises. Fnatic moved here after rolling over ex-Titan in a 3-maps contest. But honestly, with slightly more effort they could have closed it with a plain 2-0 sweep. However, the Swedes looked a bit more in form compared with their kinda disappointing entry game, and now they'll meet TQM well warmed up, and ready to provide their very best. On the other hand ex-TSM played a bit short of our expectations. Versus EnVyUs they made surplus of mistakes, especially late in the game, where most of their strats were too predictable and not at all on point to what they used to be. We'll see if they can wake up a bit, and come prepared in this game. About the maps, theres good chances of watching: de_inferno, de_dust2 and de_mirage. If this is how the veto goes, Dust2 should in favor of TQM, while Inferno may go to Fnatic, leaving Mirage as the most balanced map of the group. Betting odds are still floating around the middle, but at our end we're slightly more prone in picking Fnatic, since we rarely watched the Swedes choke in crucial games.

As mentioned with the other match, the remaining four were the expected contenders as the only ranked teams. OpTic is surely the favorite, and really shouldn't have too much trouble handling this match, particularly with Bo3 format. They've banked a considerable amount of LAN experience in the last few months, and should feel right at home for the event's final day. Meanwhile SPLYCE is entering this match after rather easy sweep of L1 in their decider match, after losing to them in their entry game. The decider match, to their credit, was the best show they've offered in this weekend, so perhaps they fould a little momentum going into this contest. But even that may not be enough to hang against the Canadians who've been playing exceptionally well. Betting Odds are already trashed in favor OpTic, which we were in agreement with. If SPLYCE is starting to click as a team, they be able to force this to the 3rd map. But honestly, we can't see OpTic failing more than once, based on what they've shown lately. So on our end, this is definitely worth skipping, but if you gotta pick, Avg on OpTic.

FlipSid3 are currently on a pretty good streak, and somehow managed to recover quite well from the departure of DavCost. Surely they still have margin of improvement to recover still, particularly since they really didn't face any top-tier team yet. Their yesterday victory over Gamers2 isn't really relevant since G2 didn't even try to put up a fight, and then withdrew from the whole APM cup just a couple of hours later. (Rumors here are that they are actually moving to Faze). On the other hand, the latest iteration of the Penta lineup, now featuring an EU roster is still kinda 'off' and not quite ready to deal with most established teams yet. Surely they did decently in the German scene, but the previous roster was without a doubt a step ahead and way more experienced on the International field. Betting odds are still quite ok for going with Fsid3, so we don't see any reason against going Low+ on them, since we don't believe we'll watch Markeloff and friends lose 2 maps in a row. (It's a Bo2, so in the worst case we should see a tie).
http://csgo.guru/match/346!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7828!$LG!$FaZe!$FaZe!$0.55!$0.72!$-0.16999999999999993!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second opening match of Group A at DreamHack Leipzig, and a pretty interesting matchup. Luminosity are in good shape following their Starseries Finals appearance, where they reached the semi-finals without a loss. They nearly advanced through to the Grand-Final, but were eliminated in the Semis against Fnatic, in what was a tightly fought contest. In the past few months, we've seen the Brazilians become one of the strongest American teams, lead by Coldzera who has been the man making the difference with his clutches, positive ratings, and obviously his overall personal skill. Due to their continued improvement, it's only matter of time before one these LAN events ends with LG on top. On the other hand, this will be the first tournament appearance for the former roster of Gamers2, now playing under the banner FaZe, the US organization that acquired Maikelele and friends this week. We have to point out the recent changes, and the events leading up to, may have affected the results of G2/FaZe who arrive here on a terrible losing streak, culminated in a 0-2 against Flipsid3 prior to stepping out of APM. Although, despite this, we're not quite sure what to expect from them this weekend. They might need more time to stabilize, or this new organization might possibly give them the right boost to get back on track in Leipzig. Odds are trending in favor of LG, which is correct, particularly considering recent LAN performances. Although FaZe could be a surprise, they'll need to prove their turnaround first. So on our end, we more confident in what Luminosity have recently achieved, so they're our pick for a Low Bet.

FaZe/G2 returned from hell, and after several months played way below their full potential, they surprisingly managed to comeback in their entry game versus Luminosity, a roster that in the short-term surely delivered way more convincingly results compared to FaZe/G2. However, Maikelele and friends, probably pumped up thanks their new Org, delivered a quite great show on Inferno, and now we're kinda excited to see what they'll put up against NaVi. On the other hand, Natus Vincere didn't sweat too much against SK, and they dismissed them with a quick 16-3 sweep, but this was kinda expected, and surely the map-pick (de_mirage) didn't really help the Danes in offering a consistent fight. Surely in a Bo1 everything can happen, in particular with a pretty unpredictable team such as FaZe, but honestly NAVI started strong as well, so we're more oriented in going Low on GuardiaN and friends, rather thank risking on the FaZe roulette.

Astralis topped their group advancing here undefeated. Despite their entry game had gone quite smoothly, the winner's match was way more challenging, and they had to fight hard in order to overcome Mousesports. Overall the Danes looked a bit shaky versus Mouz, and took many risks, but the BO1 format is always open to these kind of close games, so we're too surprised by what the Germans managed to put up, particularly since they were playing on home soil. As for Luminosity, they're surely heading into this game well warmed up by the Decider they played this morning, where they rolled over FaZe in pretty easy fashion, delivering a quick 2-0 sweep. Overall, LG are a bit hard to read. Theres no question they have great potential, but they look a bit slow in adapting, and even against SK they didn't shine as much as they should've. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_inferno, de_mirage and de_train. If this is how the veto goes, Astralis may take Mirage, while both Inferno and Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, aligned evenly near the middle, so at our end we're slightly more oriented in playing safe and go Low on Astralis, mostly because we've found them slightly more consistent, but wouldn't be surprised to see the Brazilians pushed this match to its limts.

FlipSid3 lately are on a quite impressive streak, their form is pretty high and they are one of the mid-tier teams that displayed the most interesting things in the short-term. They somehow managed to workaround the departure of DavCost, and actually they started playing in a simple but kinda effective way. On the other hand CPH Wolves are just the old Unu.AiN roster, surely an interesting one since Hunden and the gang never performed too bad, however they don't really field an huge firepower, and most of their focus is just on smart and quick plays. Overall, we wouldn't be surprised to watch CPHW taking a map, but on the extended map-pool FlipSid3 should be a good step ahead, so they're our pick for a Low+/Avg- bet. Worth noting that the current Betting Odds aren't really great, so we suggest to wait a bit and eventually skip if they drop below 18/82.

However, it is worth noting that they didn't perform too badly, in contests with scores that were pretty tight. Actually their level should be a tiny bit above Mouz, but we've some concerns related to the veto, since the French/Belgian side lately hasn't played it in a smart way at all. On the other hand, Mousesports are quite a decent streak, performance-wise, while they're currently leading Tier2, as they are also sporting a quite high form. Additionally they've performed pretty well at DH Leipzig too, and what they achieved against VP and Astralis is without a doubt, extremely promising. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cbble, de_overpass and de_mirage. If this is how the veto goes, Overpass should be in favor of ex-Titan, Mirage will likely go to Mouz, and Cobblestone is going to be a 50/50 contest. Betting odds are currently pretty aligned to the middle, and this is correct since we're talking about an extremely balanced match. At our end we're a bit more oriented in attempting a Low pick on ex-Titan, since we find them slightly more reliable on the extended map-pool; but overall we're talking about a really risky game that can easily go both ways.

This is the first online match for PixelFire since the PGL Minor, where they played fairly well, becoming one of the revelations of the event. Overall we're talking about a pretty dangerous roster. They follow a fairly complex pattern, which is not easy to counter, particularly for 'static' teams that are kinda slow in 'adjusting'. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing fine in this game as well. On the other hand CSGL experienced a quite horrible January, losing all their relevant matches since the E-League Road to Vegas loss, and they've confirmed once again that they have serious issues in dealing with BO3s. After a year, they're still playing a very limited set of maps. And out of them they rarely put up decent things, so despite the higher experience compared to PF, we have serious concerns about their reliability. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_mirage. Should the veto go this way, we're mostly talking about a set of maps that can easily go either ways. Betting odds are still quite balanced, and we'll likely watch a tight match, but honestly we're a bit more prone in attempting a Low pick on PixelFire. Not just because they played the Minor well, but moreso due to the quite high inconsistency of CSGL.

We end the day with the other Winter Classic II upper-bracket semi-final, where the winner will advance to face SPLYCE in the UB final. We've given much credit to Enemy for the strides they taken in last several weeks. However, their momentum has slowed greatly by a couple of newer teams looking to make a splash in the NA scene. NRG put an end to the undefeated streak NME carried, in very disappointing 0-2 sweep, in a contest that took advantage of very poor Veto. NME followed that up with draw vs AGG, despite the clear advantage they entered the game with. This sudden inconsistency was a common issue for Enemy in 2015, and a pattern they must break to breach the mid-tier. Games Academy on the other hand, has kinda flown under the radar, stringing together a number of strong performances, and continue to be a serious threat to NA talent-pool. Although the Brazilians have been idle for a little over week, so we make see a shaky start from them early in the contest. This will be the first time these two meet since the GA roster shuffle, but playstyle of GA closely resembles that of the team that overpowered NME last November. This is surely reflected in the current Betting Odds that are skewed in favor of the Brazilians, however Real-World Odds much closer to even, giving a slight edge to GA. On our end, we're have some reservations about what Enemy has shown recently, so we're moreso oriented towards viewing BOLTZ and co. as the more reliable team. So they are our pick for Low Bet.

FlipSid3 were defeated by Dignitas in quite a quick 2-0 sweep, and honestly they looked a bit rusty and very 'slow' in adjusting during the early phase of the maps. They still managed to provide a consistent mid-late game, but overall this is not a solid way to play, and this way will not be conducive taking home a BO3. On the other hand, CLG managed to put up a pretty good show versus EnvyUs in the morning. The North American side stepped up a bit compared to how they closed the 2015, and actually their playstyle is resembling one similar to that of Liquid. And this is a good thing since they played for months without a real 'soul', but mostly relying on their personal skill, so having a plan is surely a step forward for them. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_mirage, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto goes this way, Mirage should be in favor of FSid3, while Overpass may go in favor of CLG and Train is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of CLG, and even if we believe that they are slightly advantaged we shouldn't forget that we're talking about a LAN match and scores are generally closer than expected. So onour end, we're oriented more towards attempting a Low- pick on FlipSid3 in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages. But well, this is a risky pick on an overall a risky match, so avoid high values.

There isn't much to say about Cloud9. Over the short-term, the North American side didn't really play on a regular basis, and even less on the International field. Additionally this is their first LAN event with Stewie2K instead of SeanG@res. Overall we've serious concerns about their current form, and about their capability to deal with the rest of the Tier-1 teams without invested time with proper training (they didn't play a lot during most of the Winter season). Basically they're a pretty big question mark, so at the momeny we don't really find them to be a reliable choice. On the other hand, Gamers2 are the former [Titan] squad, who've always been quite an inconsistent team. Despite their roster, which features several really talented players, they never really managed to provide any solid shows over time, and typically they're prone to experiencing somewhat random peaks, directly followed by some terrible lows, so predicting how they'll play today is surely not an easy task at all. However, it is worth noting that they've managed to find a new home, so they might express themselves a bit better than during their most recent troubled month with Titan, so we have hopes slightly higher than usual. As for the maps, our opinion is we'll watch: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass. Should the veto go this way, both Dust2 and Overpass can easily go either way, while Cobblestone should be in favor of G2. Betting odds are still fairly balanced, and this is correct since we're talking about a match filled by question marks. But honestly we don't really find C9 a reliable pick due to the low number of official matches played as currently constructed. So we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Gamers2, hoping to see them freshly inspired and a bit more in form than in their latest exits.

Not much time before game start, so we got to be brief. LDLC White didn't have the toughest path to follow in reaching the final. Particularly compared to their Finnish counterparts. In fact their only serious obstacle to face are the rematch they're now in. But in that contest, the BO1 format didn't allow the Frenchmen the opportunity to redeem the close loss they suffered in their first encounter. ENCE on the other hand, had an easy time once they woke up, but they could partially be attributed the fact the Finns were splitting their time locally and online in the MLG pre-qualifier. That game served ENCE up a hot dish of humility, in a serious beatdown served by SK. The hometown favorites for Assembly, responded to that poor performance in furious fashion, as they steamrolled CPH Wolves. Now they surely look poised to close the event on a high note. As far as the Veto goes, theres good chances we'll see de_cache, de_dust2, and de_cbble. Should the Veto go this way, ENCE will have an edge on Cobblestone, but Dust and Cache could go either way. On our end, we're mostly aligned with Current Odds trending in favor of a hometown win. Especially have how easily they handled the CPHW early today. Additionally, the Frenchmen haven't really been tested, particulaly with ENCE closer to form. So our pick is Low+ on Allu and friends to keep the momentum going.

Here the Frenchmen always provided good shows and always been one of their best maps, so unless huge surprises they should be able to take it home without sweating too much. On the other hand SK used to be decent, but still aligned to the Tier-2/3 level, so even if on Cobblestone lately they managed to deliver a couple of close games, and almost hit the OT versus Dignitas, their level should be way below the Envy one. Betting odds are still moving a lot, but at our end we're oriented in going Avg on EnVyUs, mostly because we don't see many chances for the Danes.

During the past couple of weeks Astralis didn't really play a lot on de_inferno, but don't let this fool you, because they used to play it a lot during their TSM/TQM times (so prior renaming into Astralis in late Jan.), and you can easily check this by our own match-history (which doesn't reset at every team name change). Basically we're talking about a roster that always provided top3 shows on this maps, and even today we're quite confident about what they can put up in this game. On the other hand Gamers2, the former Titan squad, displayed promising things at GameShow Finals in Lithuania, and at some point they were also about to beat Astralis, but instead they ended choking in OT and shortly after they ended the whole event with a kinda terrible loss to CLG. So overall they are still pretty inconsistent and prone to fails. However, here we're talking about BO1s, so they should be able to keep the focus more than a BO3 and eventually surprise. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, so we don't see any reason for risking a pick on Gamers2 when the Danes looked way more consistent and reliable, so we're going with a Low bet on Astralis.

A map historically kinda inconsistent within the NA scene, where we've frequently seen some relatively surprising upsets. Both teams already faced each other on this map just a week ago, and NRG managed to take home the match by good measure. We're inclined to believing that the EU expertise behind the team may have put them a good step ahead (on this map) of most of the full-American rosters around. However, we should also note that Enemy always been pretty decent on Mirage as well, and aside that match against NRG they've generally achieved good results, even against respectable opponenets, such as Winterfox and Renegades. So we'll likely watch a slightly closer match compared to the one we enjoyed in early February. Betting odds are still decent and quite balanced, but this time our prediction is trending in favor of NRG since we find their EU component more valuable in a game featured on Mirage.

Liquid are moving here after an extremely disappointing show against the CompLexity's new roster. Hiko and friends failed to deliver a proper show, and most of what they managed to put up was kinda pug-like, and pretty far from what we were expecting. Just like VP in Europe, Liquid are mostly paying the price for the lack of training during the winter season. But to their credit, they did manage to comeback on Dust to even up the series. On de_overpass they've always been pretty decent, but as stated above, we've serious concerns about their current form. Additionally we can't say that Luminosity are a 'forgiving' team. The Brazilians actually are one of the teams that performed better in this first part of the year. Aside from being pretty consistent on the extended map-pool, they are also sporting rather high form. Additionally, on this map they have taken down teams such as Astralis, so theres no question they know what they're doing right now. Betting odds are trending in favor of Luminosity, and this is correct since they should have a clear edge, so we're oriented towards going for Low+ bet on them as well, since right now we find them way more reliable than Liquid.

We move back to the RGN Winter Classic, as it nears its end we have the consolidation final to determine who will face SPLYCE in the Grand-Final. Games Academy now playing under the 'Tempo Storm' banner, have proven in the early stages of the year they're a threat to be taken seriously. The Brazilians were bumped from the Upper Bracket in their last meeting with NME in semis, in a closely contested 2-1 loss. After 2 wins in the LB (inlcuding a 16-10 win over Wfx), they get a chance at a rematch in hopes of avoiding elimination. Overall, that loss to Enemy was the only relevant game they lost in the short-term, as they've defeated most of the 3rd-2nd NA Tier. As we've mentioned recently, Enemy high level form they began the year with has slowed greatly, diverting them back to the inconsistent pattern they folowed last year. Relyks and co. have surely shown vast improvements and shown alot of promise, but allowed their frustartions to take over the UB final versus SPLYCE, resulting in an awful 3rd map after failing to close the sweep 14-16 on Cobblestone. This pattern continued through their EPL matches since, going 1-1 in both their 2 game meetings with NRG and Renegades. As for this contest, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_dust2, and de_mirage. If the Veto goes this way, Dust should favor GA, while NME will be advantaged on Cache, leaving Mirage which can go either. Currently we seeing the Betting Odds rolling infavor of the Brazilian-side, but we must remember their success has been mostly short-term in addition to the fact they were defeated by Enemy in their last meeting. On our end, we find this a very tricky match to predict, particularly since the Americans have been experiencing such peaks and valleys. With that in mind, the recent inconsistency has us weary of an NME repeat performance, so we're slightly more oriented in viewing the Brazilians as the more reliable. So our pick is Low Bet on Games Academy/(Tempo Storm).

And we're not referring to E-Frag, since their potential was fully known since day-1, together with Mouz they were probable candidates to reach the Grand-Final. But we're talking about ALTERNATE aTTaX who surprisingly and impressively managed to send HR packing, after a pretty tight game that featured all 3 maps extended with some thrilling Overtime. The German side had quite a rough opening match, but then got back on track and grabbed two decisive victories. This undoubtedly confirms their decent form currently, previously displayed in their online matches over the past several weeks. So at this point, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them offer a good show against the Bulgarians as well. About maps, we're expecting to watch: de_cache, de_cbble and de_train. If the veto does go this way, E-Frag should have an edge on Cache, while Cobblestone is mostly 50/50, leaving Train which may end in favor of Alternate. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on E-Frag, so we're oriented in sticking with them as they should be slightly more reliable. But overall we are anticipating a pretty close contest.

The Ukrainians displayed a quite decent for so far, but overall we're oriented in considering them slightly below the Mouz level, mostly because after a while their strats are get a bit predictable. On the other hand Mousesports provided a quite great show during the whole event, and moved here after scoring three 2-0s in a row, additionally they'll get also an automatic 1-0 advantage due coming from the Upper-Bracket, so they are obviously favored for taking home the trophy. Not much to say about maps, since we're talking about a BO5, however our pick is a Low+/Avg- on Mousesports because we find the Germans slightly more reliable on the extended map pool, additionally the 1-0 advantage is going to help them even further.

Astralis hasn't quite managed to reach their top form. They've surely been decent in the short-term, but still quite far from what showed last fall. They come into this match with a mixed bag of results over the past few weeks, including their 3rd place finish at GEC Finals. During the 1st week of ESL S3, they split 2 maps with Gamers2, through a pretty even contest. The form of FlipSid3 on the other hand, is mostly aligned to mid-T2. Like the Danes, F3 enters this week with a mixed bag as well. However, they reached the APM S2 Grand-Final, taking down E-frag, HellRaisers, and CSGL along the way. Unfortunately, Mouz is their achilles heel, and the Ukrainians were swept to finish runner-up (but honestly, playing a Final with a stand-in and without Markeloff was an huge blow for them). But overall, a respectable upper T2 performance. But they still have troubles in dealing with Top Tier teams. Like the challenge before them today. Talking about Mirage, any map advantage is mostly negated. Both teams play on Mirage on a consistent basis and pick it with the same frequency. Currently we're seeing the odds trashed well in favor of the Danes, which is correct since they'll very likely take home this game. But at our end, with percentages floating around 85/15 we're more oriented in calling a skip due the very low reward. However, if you want to pick a side anyway you should stick with Astralis.

As we've discussed before, ENCE is a roster packed with some potential firepower. Although the Finnish lineup has struggled to find their rhythm and chemistry to string together wins in contests they surely have talent to win. As a result, we've instead watched a series of mixed results that likely threatens the future of the team. But they are entering this match following an improved performance against DenDD that earns the Finns a spot in CEVO S9. Now they just need to start doing this with more regularity. Meanwhile the former PixelFire lineup, playing currently as Orgless while searching for a new Org, demonstrated their potential during the PGL Minor last month. February by contrast hasn't been as promising, as they've mostly lost all their matches. However they are entering this match following their best game of the month, by way of a 2-0 sweep of CPH Wolves. Though we're encouraged by this, they need to show some consistency before we gain confidence in them. Betting Odds are rolling in favor of the Finns, which correct considering their firepower and (slightly) better recent results. On our end we're inclined to agree, but this is a format prone to draws which we've good chances of seeing. Though this may be closer than expected, percentages are still rewarding enough for Low Bet on ENCE so we'll follow that path.

Again we're dealing with LG and coL, whose lineup only has a handful of matches in under their belts. So once more, not the most balanced of matchups, however, the Brazilians map advantage might be slightly less significant since it's a map they never focused too much on. Although, they've still managed positive results here. We already discussed the form of Luminosity in recent weeks, beginning EPL S3 last week taking both maps over Liquid. On paper, this week's opponent should be step a below, but as a new lineup, there's not much data to reference for LG to prepare with. This may add an element of randomness that can even the field a bit. In their first couple of matches,compLexity managed to setup some encouraging things, requiring their mid-tier opponents to sweat for the win. But we've yet to see them on de_train, so we don't have anything to reference in assessing their map threat. But again, we're talking about them going up against one of the best in the game right now. And since the Betting Odds are already trashed in favor of LG, we'd certainly recommend a skip here. But you want to pick a side, our pick is Luminosity.

Renegades haven't too busy during the early stages of the year, having only participated in IEM Taipei. There, they likely should've been the favorite but finished runner up to TheMongolz, who convincingly swept the Aussies in the Grand-Final. In last weeks EPL entry games, they managed a decent effort, beating Enemy on Train, but failed to repeat at mirage. Considering the above average form of NME this year, (although more inconsistent lately) a 1-1 is an acceptable result. CLG on the other hand, is kind of riddle. They played surprisingly well at GEC Finals. But moving online, they lost their first 4 EPL games (split between Cloud9 and Tempo Storm), two of which were lopsided losses. Near end of last Summer, they were a solid Top-T2 team, but their recent performances are more aligned to Tier3. So we have concerns over whether they can regain the prior form. For this first game, de_dust2 will be featured, which surely favors the Americans. Especially since its not one of the Australians top map picks. The last occasion these two played on it, the Aussies managed to beat CLG, but that was last quarter. Its also worth noting, Renegades has only played a couple matches since replacing Havoc with USTILO. Betting Odds are fairly even still, favoring CLG slightly. We pretty much in full agreement, so we're oriented in following the same path since we feel they have a higher ceiling. So our pick is a Low Bet on CLG.

We already discussed about the form of FlipSid3 in their previous 2 games, so we'll just add that on Cobblestone Markeloff and friends frequently managed to deliver quite good shows, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a proper fight. On the other hand FaZe basically never really played this map before, and they always favored Overpass over it, so guessing how they'll play is basically impossible, even if on paper they should sport an higher firepower compared to FSid3. Betting odds are still skewed in favor of FaZe, despite the lack of reliable data, and this is surely a bit weird. As we stated above we wouldn't be surprised to watch a game way closer than expected, so we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB/Low- pick on FlipSid3, mostly because their higher experience on Cobble.

The entry game has been community voted to be EnVyUs vs Fnatic, so we're kicking-off with a pretty exciting matchup, featuring two of the most solid teams of this first Quarter of the year. Due to the very peculiar format used in this event, (basically a 'King of the Hill'), predicting the games taking place during the first couple of days is going to be pretty hard. Additionally, the BO1 matches aren't going to help much either, especially in top-tier games, like the one we're reviewing now. As usual, guessing the map in BO1s is basically impossible. So we've to evaluate the teams based on the bigger picture. In this case, Fnatic look to be the slightly more reliable pick. Considering EnVyUs frequently starts their event entry matches kinda 'slowly', and generally their LAN performances have always been a tiny bit below the established level of the Swedes. Obviously the map will play an huge role, but on our end we're prone toward picking a Low bet on Fnatic, since we find them as slightly more solid on the extended map-pool.

However, here we'll likely watch de_cbble as map, and things will surely be more balanced, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch OTs as well.

We just saw Astralis defeat NV, and keeping with the Danish alliance, they elected fellow countrymen Dignitas to square off with Vexed, in hopes of keeping the Danish teams in the best position for success in this tournament. As saw just two matches ago, the LAN success we've seen from Dignitas over the last several weeks is still going strong, but they were unable to close out the game against Fnatic, who forced the Danes into OT. But the relevancy here, is the competitive form RUBINO and friends are currently displaying. And now, thanks to the Astralis victory, they've been given the best chance for a win, having to face the Poles for their next battle. Vexed on the other hand, as we've discussed have been quite a mixed bag in recent weeks. In their entry game of this event, already faced the Danes for a disappointing show, in a contest the Polish-side never really threatened. Following a quick win over x6, they fell for the second time vs Gamers2. So they're now facing elimination for the first time this weekend. Current Betting Odds are already trashed in favor of the Danish. And based off what they've achieved on LAN in recent events, we're in agreement with strong chances here. Although, 85/15 to overly favored. Regardless, we are also confident with what they've done, so with these percentages we're oriented towards skipping this match, since we doubt Vexed can manage to stop the momentum of the Danes. But if you must pick a side, Dignitas is our pick.

Both teams are landing here after a couple of pretty convincingly matches, and in particular the last ones were pretty tough for both sides. Cloud9 had to sweat a lot in order to dismiss NRG, and they managed to roll over them just in the last few rounds of map3. Honestly C9, despite the pretty decent streak, are currently looking a bit shaky, and we've some doubts about what they'll put up against a well structured team such as Tempo Storm. On the other hand, the Brazilians had to deal with OpTiC, in what turned into another really tight match, even if the last map has been closed in a pretty easy fashion by Tempo. However, talking about the current match, we're expecting to watch: de_dust2, de_cache and de_mirage. If we nailed the Veto, Mirage should be in favor of Tempo, while both Cache and Dust2 can easily go either ways. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on Tempo Storm, so we're oriented in taking this path, since we find them more reliable thanks to the stronger momentum.
http://csgo.guru/match/393!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8342!$EnVyUs!$VP!$VP!$0.6!$0.73!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$2nd batch of EPL matches, and another high level matchup, this time featuring EnVyUs and Virtus.Pro. Theres not too much say about the Frenchmen, who remain to be one of the best teams in the world. They'll enter this week after a decent showing at ESL Barcelona, where they were mainly paired up the elite of the event. There losses to Astralis and 2/3 against Fnatic saw Envy eliminated in the tournament. Overall, in the short-term, the French side have looked in good form and continued to beat most every team out there, with the Swedes being the only exclusion to defeat NV consecutively. Plus we're talking about Cobblestone, a map they've frequently achieved good results. Virtus.Pro on the hand, are currently experiencing serious problems, and come into this match on quite a rough losing streak. Except for a single map, we've yet to see the Poles take home the victory. And these struggles are occurring with mid-high tier teams. Whatever internal issues they're dealing with, are surely gonna need addressed soon, before we see the Org intervene. As for this contest, Cbble may not be the worst map for the Polish, but its one they've faced issues in handling even lower ranked teams. So we highly doubt this map and matchup will be what they need to turn things around. As expected, Betting Odds are mostly trashed in favor in the French, which is correct when considering everything mentioned above. Normally, we'd entertain an ICB in this situation, however, the margins of some of their losses are more concerning than the losses themselves. And we've really not seen anything to be encouraged by from them this year. So although they may sport the firepower to provide an upset, we doubt that come today with the Frenchmen in such strong form. So on our end, we're oriented towards skipping this match. But if you really want to bet, our pick EnvyUs.
http://csgo.guru/match/395!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8370!$E-Frag!$CSGL!$null!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Third game in a row for CSGL, and in the previous couple of games we've already discussed the kinda inconsistent form that the Poles continue experiencing. Over the short-term, they probably stepped up a tiny bit, but overall they are still a huge question mark and also a team with serious issues with the extended map-pool. On the other hand, E-Frag are surely on a better run. They had a performance drop during early February, but since in the past week they started delivering rather decent shows again. The Tie they managed to hit yesterday against SK is surely promising. Overall E-frag should be a quite reliable pick, and in the worst case, we'll likely just watch a Tie. However, betting odds aren't really amazing, and honestly with so many good matches around you should just evaluate a skip for this one. But if you really want to pick a side, our suggestion is to go with a Low+ bet on E-Frag.
http://csgo.guru/match/396!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8381!$Astralis!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.45!$0.26!$0.19!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$We're kicking-off the day with a pretty amazing BO5 Showmatch, featuring a 5,000 EUR prize-pool. Fnatic are moving here on a the customary winning streak. Aside from taking home the ESL Barcelona trophy, the Swedes also maintained their top-notch momentum by rolling over SK in their latest EPL contest. Overall Flusha and friends, are simply continuing their series of ongoing good results since Fall 2015, further demonstarting themselves as the reference team within the Tier-1. On the other hand, after a slow start to the year, Astralis finally moved back to a performance level aligned with their potential. Even if there is still some margin for improvement. During ESL Barcelona they managed to hit the final stage of the event, but they dropped the ball against Fnatic. However, just like their Swedish rivals they continued performing well in their following online games too, beating Virtus.Pro by measure. Talking about the current match, at our end we're oriented in giving an edge to Fnatic because they are generally more reliable on the extended map-pool, and despite possibly losing one or two maps in the process, they should be still be capable of keeping a slight step ahead Astralis. However, we must note that the current betting odds are just trash, and honestly looking at these percentages when two Top-Tier rosters are playing is always kinda cringeworthy. So even if we truly believe that Fnatic can take home the match, we don't see any good reason for not attempting an ICB on Astralis as far as the values will keep floating around 20/80.

For this event, Enemy are again fielding Koosta, which is surely a positive thing since he'll bring back some much needed fire-power, and will also re-balance a roster that over recent weeks have turned from being quite reliable to quite inconsistent. However, despite the short-term lineup issues, Enemy are still one of the NA teams that have provided their best performances in this first part of the year. St their peak, they were playing on par with most of the North American powerhouses, so they shouldn't be underestimated, even if they surely lack the International experience. On the other hand, FlipSid3 are heading here with a mixed set of online results in the bag. But they at least played pretty well at the APM Finals, and overall we've a bit more faith in their LAN performances when compared those Online. However, we might watch Markeloff and friends having issues during the first half, since the BO1 format isn't the best for a team whose typically been a bit slow in reading the opponent. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Ukrainians, and we're prone to agree since we find them more experienced on the International field, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on FlipSid3.

However, we already discussed both rosters in the previous matchups, so there isn't much to add, other than the Swedes are looking promising but haven't been properly proven on LAN yet. Meanwhile the Germans should be capable of fielding more solid strat-based gameplay, even if aim-wise they are likely a slight step below the Swedish side. Overall betting odds are again pretty balanced, and again we're talking about a game that can easily go either way depending on the map picked. However, at our end we're trending in favor of a Low bet on Torpedo, since we believe that there are good chances we'll watch de_cbble as map.

The first of the opening matches for this BO1 hell, features a pretty interesting matchup between Mousesports and NiP. Mouz has a had a decent start to the year, playing pretty consistently at a high T2 level, and have certainly made a strong case as a T1 prospect. At APM Finals, we watched the Germans dominate the field without losing a single map. So theres no question regarding their LAN capabilities, though here they'll surely have a more difficult path to travel, beginning with the Swedes who managed to to edge them out, twice, online last week for EPL. NiP on the other hand, have actually been one of the least active T1 teams of this first Quarter. However, to some surprise, the downtime seems to have had little to no affect, on their effectiveness and executions. But this will be their first LAN appearance of the year, so we wouldn't be too surprised to see them going through a small period of adjustment moving offline. Overall, F0rest and friends are good form entering the week, backed by a series of encouraging results. Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Swedes, which is correct, especially since they've already topped the Germans in their first two meeting this year. But Real-World Odds are way closer to even than the percentages we're seeing right now. Although they manged to wins those contests, but by the slimmest of margins, including some OT. On our end, we're inclined to pick the Swedes as well. But if the percentages reach 75/25, we're oriented toward trying our luck with an ICB on Mousesports, in hopes they take advantage of some NiP LAN rust for their entry game.

This is also a classic matchup of recent CS:GO history, featuring two of the top contenders behind the Swedes. EnVyUs have been amongst the busier teams this year, having already grabbed the GameShow Cup, and hit a decent run in StarSeries Finals. However, coming into this event, the Frenchmen are at a critical moment, where in the short term they been experiencing difficulties in Tier-1 games. So getting tested in the entry game could greatly impact their path through Katowice. However, they have proven to be always get their game up a notch more often than not when the stakes are important. Astralis, on the other hand, have overall been in pretty good shape. With the exception of Fnatic, the Danes have been managing victories over almost every other team out there. Even when they've gotten in trouble, they've had Device to help lead them out. Betting odds are trending in favor of EnVyus, but this is a pretty much a pure 50/50 matchup. So we're slightly inclined to play the percentages for higher reward, so our pick is a Low Bet on Astralis.

Surely Virtus.Pro cruised through some pretty troubled waters for several months, and achieved a kinda terrible streak of sub-par results. But overall their level is still way above that of E-Frag, so TaZ and friends should be able to deal with the Bulgarians without sweating too much. On the other hand, E-Frag are without a doubt the team sporting the lesser chances to move through the Group Stage, but in the mid-term they have showed some consistency and decent organization, so despite their lack of fire-power compared to the big names floating around at this event, they should be able to deliver a few acceptable shows in most of their contests. Here we might watch a slightly closer game if we see Dust2 as map, but overall we don't believe this will happen. So we're oriented in going for a Low+ pick on Virtus.Pro.
http://csgo.guru/match/408!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8480!$Liquid!$coL!$Liquid!$0.58!$0.77!$-0.19000000000000006!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Aside from another day packed with the Katowice Group Stage, we've a couple of CEVO matches too, and here a pretty good NA contest. Liquid are fresh off qualifying for the MLG Columbus Major next month, where we saw Hiko mostly single-handed put up one of his performances this year in a 2-1 victory over HellRaisers. And just prior to that, they grabbed their spot in DH Masters Malmo. As we saw in their trip to Columbus, we're surely seeing them regain their form, and their position in the NA Tier-1. On the other hand we've CompLexity, who've provided slightly better showings than we expected following the NA shuffle. However, despite the higher compete level, they've yet to really close out in these mostly mid-tiered matches. But it's worth noting cause they've surely made their ranked opponents sweat for these wins. But staying competitive in most of these contests is quite encouraging, and we wouldn't be surprised to see a match much closer than expected. As for this contest, since coL managed to split the maps with Liquid in the first EPL meeting, they've got a some reference strat-wise going into this match. And regarding the maps for this BO3, there are good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_dust2, and de_mirage. If the Veto follows this pattern, coL will have an edge on Cache, while Liquid will be favored on Dust2 and Mirage. Betting Odds are already trashed in Liquid's favor, which we have to agree on, based on what they've managed in the past few weeks. As usual, when we're looking 85/15 percentages, we're oriented toward skipping. Although we expect coL can grab a map, we highly doubt Liquid will lose twice here, so they're our pick if we have to pick a side.
http://csgo.guru/match/416!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8484!$LG!$Na'Vi!$LG!$0.48!$0.63!$-0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Incredibly fascinating matchup awaiting us here in the first Semi-Final of IEM Katowice 2016, featuring two of the top teams in the World out of the EU and NA scenes. Coming into the event, we knew Group-A held some surprises, considering the dynamic mix of elite talent within. Amongst this mix Luminosity have been top NA representative to have gradually forced their way into the top the pack, and over the past quarter+, they've developed a high level consistency needed to go deep in these championship tournaments. Being grouped with teams such as Natus Vincere and Fnatic (arguably 'the' two best in the world) and even NiP, the Brazilians weren't quite expected to take the top seed, or even reach the Quarters for that matter. However, FalleN and the gang, had no doubts of their own, going 4-1 through the Group Stage to grab the lone Semi-Final spot. Mostly impressively, they managed to grab consecutive wins over NAVI and Fnatic, and again look to be in full form for the trophy run. Meanwhile, Natus Vincere already grabbed two trophies this year, as favorites in these events dating back to last Summer. Although they managed to arrive in this Semi, the road here has surely been less convincing than Brazilian side. Mid way through group stage, they were on the outside looking in. But took advantage of their superiority, winning the final 3 maps their spot. Before the semis, they drew Tempo Storm in the Qtrs. The Brazilian group, kinda the little brother to LG, sporting extremely similar playstyles and practice routines. Despite the obvious advantage GuardiaN and friends held over Tempo Storm, many of the mistakes we saw from NaVi on Day 1, continued today, and had to climb back from a 13-8 3rd map deficit after seemingly having full control after Overpass. So currently we've serious concerns about the CIS-side against LG. We're not alone with these concerns, as current Betting Odds are trending in favor of LG. Percentages we really haven't seen before with NaVi on the other side. But we need to remember, much like the Swedes, NAVI tends to look a bit reserved in the early stages, but typically bring out the best as the stakes are raised. And here we also have a bit of history between these two at this level, so 3 maps and possible OT would't be at all surprising. Regarding the Maps, there's good chances we'll watch: de_mirage, de_train, and de_inferno. Provided we see these maps come out of the Veto, LG should be slightly favored on Train, NaVi advantaged on Inferno, leaving Mirage which could easily go either way. So we're pretty much looking at a pure 50/50 matchup, with RW Odds slightly edged in favor of NAVI, largely due to the success on the grand stage. On our end, we're wondering if this is finally the one LG can top. And at this point, there form looks to be the more solid of two, especially after watching what TStorm managed vs NAVI already today. So we're going to follow the trend and go with a Low Bet on Luminosity, in hopes of seeing them reach the Grand Final.

The final chapter of this Polish journey features the old King Fnatic matched up with LG, the rising Brazilians to arrive in this contest after 6 months of progressive improvements, that turned them from being an average NA team to one of the strongest and most respected sides of the International scene. Talking about this matchup, Luminosity started Katowice, pedal to the metal, ending the Group-Stage as first seed and in a mostly flawless fashion. Then yesterday, they raised the bar even higher by beating Natus Vincere with an impressive 2-0 sweep. Honestly we were expecting a little more from GuardiaN and friends, particularly since they joined this event as one of the favored teams. But well, here the Brazilians delivered quite a good veto, and handled the Ukrainians quite smartly on de_inferno, preventing them from hitting the third map. On the other hand, Fnatic experienced a slightly more bumpy road to the top. They finished their Group in 2nd place, which forced them to face Virtus.Pro in the Quarter-Final. But unfortunately we can't really say that the Poles offered any solid resistance. Basically they just lost a good opportunity to bounce back after several months of struggles. However, the following Semi-Final, against Astralis turned into a pretty intense battle, where the Danes, as we were expecting, joined the game motivated enough to take home a victory. They were even on the verge of achieving it, but after taking the contest to the third map, they dropped the ball and the series. About maps, since we're talking about a BO5, so we'll basically enjoy most of them. And generally, this is a condition that puts Fnatic in a slightly more advantaged position, due to their extended experience on most of the maps. Generally we can say that we find Fnatic advantaged on Cache and Train, while LG may grab de_mirage, leaving de_dust2 and de_inferno as pretty balanced grounds. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Swedes, and we're prone to give them a tiny edge as well, because of the BO5 format. However we're talking about two teams who overall offered extremely solid performances this week, so the percentages to see FalleN and the gang doing well are pretty good too. At our end we're prone toward endorsing the Brazilian 'Cindarella story' by going for a Low pick on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/418!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8496!$Method!$YP!$YP!$0.48!$0.49!$-0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$After a busy week in Katowice, we got to enjoy much welcomed calmer weekend, but we've one match of note on the EU schedule, though not the most exciting matchup out there. In the first round of single elimination bracket for the Binary Dragons Cup, we've a Russian derby between a couple of teams we've seen mix it up with some of the more relevant teams of recent events. Method versus YP could take on more of a pug-like contest, which can certainly offer its moments of entertainment. And although, neither can deliver much against the pro ranked teams (yet), but at head to head level within these local/international matches we are looking at a mostly pure 50/50 contest. This Method lineup is the young bunch who filled the roster after the former lineup parted ways from the org, who we first saw participate in the GEC. Although they were no match for Astralis, they Russians did so some promise when matched up with C9, who they forced to actually sweat their way to the win. Considering the org's efforts to keep the logo active within the scene, we'll likely being seeing more from them in the future. So on a slow day, such as today, we'll throw them a little spot-light as they show some promise to push their the front of the unranked pack. YP on the other hand, we recently saw in Columbus for the Major Qualifier. However, their path to relevance may be a longer one, considering the lack of pushback they offered there. Additionally, they're fielding stand-ins today, so we're not expecting too much progress in their development on this stage. As mentioned, this is actually a quite balanced matchup, while the current Betting Odds are trending in favor of YP. But that is likely moreso influenced by their recent MLG appearance. While on our end, we feel the chances are better to see Method take this BO3, so we're oriented toward taking advantage of these percentages for the higher reward and going with a Low Bet on them as well.

While we're expecting a pretty inconsistent match on Dust2, according to how these teams performed in the short-term, we believe we'll watch less surprises in this contest taking place on de_train. Train has always been a pretty good map for the Swedes, and even if they've recently dropped the ball a bit, and other Tier-1 rosters (mostly Fnatic &amp; NaVi) turned into the reference teams for this map, we've to say that NiP are still playing it quite well, and surely above a wide margin of the first Tier. On the other hand, FaZe recently never really delivered exciting shows on Train, and overall they are looking kinda inconsistent. So for this game, we're oriented in giving an edge to NiP. Betting odds are still decent for a Low pick on F0rest and friends, so we'll take this path.

As we mentioned in the previous game as well, Envy yesterday enforced a pretty serious roster change, bringing in DEVIL from LDLC instead of Kioshima. This is going to play a critical role in the today's matches, in particular since they are fighting their fellow countrymen and rivals Gamers2, a roster that always gave them more than an issue, in particular in BO1s. For this contest we're moving to de_train, a map where both teams provided kinda inconsistent results in the short-term, alternating extremely good shows with kinda weird defeats, basically without following any real pattern. Generally we're oriented in believing that these teams always played Train relying a bit too much on their fire-power, so we'll likely enjoy a pretty momentum based match, where the team coming here with the better form from the previous game will likely take home this one as well. Anyway, historically we always had serious concerns about how Gamers2 handle the late-game, and this is a map where managing it properly is extremely important, so even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch Shox and co. doing well (in particular if they'll grab Cache), we're a bit more prone in picking a Low bet on EnVyUs, since they are usually a bit more 'progressive' in their performances compared to G2.

Ancient are coming here after hitting a pretty decent streak during the past week. The Swedish mix managed to take home the Pantamera Challenge in Stockholm, basically their first noteworthy result after a rather extended mixed bag of performances. However, worth noting that they weren't facing any super relevant opponents. Aside from ENCE, Orgless and Alternate, the rest of the teams attending the event were kinda low-end. On the other hand E-Frag just moved back from IEM Katowice, where they failed to grab a Playoff spot, but still managed to take home a relevant victory over EnVyUs, which is surely more than we were expecting. Particularly based on the extremely high level of their Group. About the current match, we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game, with quite even Betting Odds as well. At our end we're prone toward picking a Low bet on E-Frag, since we find the Bulgarians a bit more solid compared to the peaks and valleys that Ancient delivered in the short-term.

Again, we feel NRG could be a little problematic for Brazilians. But their tendency of inconsistence makes them a bit of a question mark. After handling CLG by exceptional margins, they followed up with a lackluster performance with ex-Enemy, who played with a standin, that mostly unraveled as the game progressed. So they're a difficult team predict. Meanwhile, we're all aware of the level of Luminosity, with their dominance at Katowice up to the Grand-Final folly against Fnatic, fresh in our minds. However, Mirage hasn't been their stronger map. So if theres a chance for an upset on of these two maps, the chances might be slightly higher here. Betting Odds are of course heavily in favor of the Brazil-side, so our LG pick isn't quite profitable enough, so we're oriented toward risking a Low-ICB Bet on NRG to split the 2 map set.

Virtus.Pro during the last Quarter collected a long series of extremely disappointing results, and even if they displayed some signs of improvement in Katowice, where they managed to move through their group and land in the Quarter-Final, overall they are still way below their 2015 form. Without doubts they are one of the top-tier teams that paid the highest bill from the lack of training during the Xmas-January break. On the other hand, Gamers2 are surprisingly sporting a pretty great momentum, few days ago they took advantage of the EnVyUs issues for taking home an extremely important double EPL victory, and now they are joining this game with an extremely high motivation and form, something we didn't see in the French/Belgian roster since a long while. Obviously they still have to work a bit on their BO3 performances, but in BO1s they are actually a pretty serious threat for every single Tier-1 team around. In the new year PashaBiceps and friends played on de_train just a couple of times, and in both occasions they pulled out horrible performances. But worth noting that in 2015 they used to be quite decent on this map, so we're oriented in believing that these results were mostly triggered by the lack of form rather than map-related issues. However, surely Shox &amp; co. displayed better things on Train in the short-term, and at our end we're oriented in giving them an edge. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on the French side, so our pick is Gamers2, with the hope to watch them keeping their streak.

Since CSGL made the recent roster change of bringing back MINISE in place of oskarish, the team has finally seemed to develope some good chemistry, managing to stack together some solid outings. Aside from the random fail to FSid3 at the beginning of the month, they’ve offering more signs of encouragement than we’ve seen from the Poles in recent months. Penta on the other hand, has taken a slide down the ranks over the past quarter. And really only offering up decent results in irrelevant contests. In their most recent bout with the Polish-side, they looked a good step behind. As for the Maps, there’s good chances we’ll watch de_cache, de_cbble, and de_mirage. If we nailed the Veto, the Poles will be advantaged on Cache and Cobblestone, while the Germans will have the edge on Mirage. Betting odds are still decent, give a similar favor to the polish-side. On our end, we feel CSGL is the more reliable, percentages are rewarding for Low Bet on them as well, so we’ll follow that path.

After a disappointing showing during the heart of Katowice, E-frag managed a couple of decent performances in the GameShow Invitational and GO:CL. Most notably was an Overtime victory of a struggling SK squad. Overall they’re in decent form coming into the weekend, but looking at the talent-pool for the event, we doubt they’ll offer any surprises past the Quarter-Finals. CPH Wolves on the other hand, have shown glimpses of potential, but they remain a level below much of 3rd Tier. They managed couple of solid efforts, earning them draws with ENCE and Vexed in mid-February. So they’ve surely shown the they’re capable of threatening the Bulgarians, but highly doubt they’ll manage to take more than a single map in the BO3. Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of the Bulgarian-side, which is correct when comparing the current levels of the two. On our end, we surely feel E-frag should take the match, and percentages are still rewarding for Low Bet, so we’ll follow this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/431!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8625!$CW!$G2!$G2!$0.4!$0.14!$0.26!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Second Quarter-Final of the DH Malmo Qualifier, and here we've a game that on paper should be kinda one-sided. Gamers2 in the short-term are doing pretty well, and aside the yesterday's loss (16-14) against Virtus.pro they mostly looked pretty on point, so they should be able to deal with CPH Wolves without experiencing relevant troubles. However, worth noting that the French/Belgian side had to sweat quite a lot in order to land into this match, and their previous game against eSuba turned way more complex than what we were expecting. On the other hand, CPH Wolves aren't really the most consistent team out there, but overall they don't play too bad, and within the 3rd Tier they are above many other contenders, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking home a map if Gamers2 will join this game with the same motivation of their previous match against eSuba. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_dust2, de_cbble and de_overpass. If we nailed the Veto, G2 should sport a decent advantage on the whole map-pool, but Dust2 could be slightly closer than expected. Betting odds are still decent for an Average pick on Gamers2, so we're oriented in sticking with the French side.

FlipSid3 are landing in this BO3 following a mixed bag of not so exciting results, and even if yesterday they somehow advanced to the Semi-Final of DreamHack Malmo Qualifier, we can't really say they managed to deliver stunning performances in their way through the bracket. And aside the sweat and tears they had to drop to beat Ancient and Preparation, the Ukrainians failed offering any resistance in EPL, where the teams involved are generally more on-point and decently Tiered. On the other hand ENCE aren't really the most consistent team out there, the Finns are experiencing structural issues since the very first days, and they repeatedly failed in delivering consistent shows even in events where they joined as favored. In the short-term Allu and co. looked pretty shaky and they ended losing against mixes such as TDJSF and Preparation, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them struggling in this game as well. About maps, we're expecting to watch de_cbble, de_mirage and de_train. IF the veto will take this path FSid3 should be advantaged on Cobblestone, while Mirage and Train can easily go either way. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, but at our end we're prone in going for a Low pick on FlipSid3 since we find them slightly more reliable on the extended map-pool compared to ENCE.
http://csgo.guru/match/433!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8677!$OG!$WinterFox!$OG!$0.58!$0.83!$-0.25!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$A couple of matches on tonight's NA EPL schedule, and we'll begin with two teams currently trending in opposite directions. OpTic has been quite active over the short-term, and we've repeatedly discussed the high form the Canadians are currently performing. Other than the Brazilians, OpTic has been rolling over most of the NA division, entering this game after dominating compLexity on back-to-back maps. So we're not expecting this match to hold any surprises, particularly on Inferno, where OpTiC has played more effectively in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the struggles of WinterFox continues to disappoint. Other than the random decent outing, which is occurring with less frequency, they've arrive today with little to optimistic over. In the past, while the Canadians still played for Conquest, Wfx used to hold the map advantage. But since then, ShahZaM and friends has stepped up a solid level, while WinterFox has arguably declined. So again tonight, we're not expecting them to make OpTic sweat too much. Betting Odds are pretty much trashed in favor of OpTic. As usual with such unprofitable percentages, we recommend evaluating a skip. But if we must pick a side, a Low Bet on OpTic is our pick.

Dignitas in the short-term delivered more valleys than peaks, and even yesterday they failed to bounce back versus Natus Vincere, despite the promising first map. In the past weeks the Danes played way below their average, and actually we've serious concerns about their current form, in particular because we're entering in a Quarter filled by extremely relevant events. On the other hand, Gamers2 after the fail against Mousesports (that costed them a spot at DH Malmo), quickly returned on the right path by beating SK in a quite convincingly fashion, confirming that the good results they collected in the past few weeks weren't a fluke, but a consistent trend. On de_inferno, the Frenchmen always provided pretty good performances, so they are stepping into this contest as favored, in particular since Rubino and the gang lately looked kinda shaky on this map. Betting odds are still fine for a Low+ pick on Gamers2, so we're oriented in picking this way.
http://csgo.guru/match/435!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8709!$VP!$Imm!$VP!$0.6!$0.9!$-0.30000000000000004!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$We kick off today’s busy schedule, earlier than normal as we’re in Split, Croatia for the Counter Pit Season 2 Finals. For the opening match, Virtus.Pro was one of the four teams previously invited, so they bypassed the online stage with a bye to the $80K offline event. Considering the form of the Poles this first Quarter, this is kind of a gift, since their slump during the February may have prevented them this opportunity. Other than a select few matches, PashaBiceps and friends have had serious issues with regaining the level they achieved last year. On the other hand, Immunity is lone qualifier from the Oceanic division, which they secure by finishing top of the 6 team online stage. Although the AU scene surely has some potential, overall, there's a substantial margin separating them from the level of the some of the competition present here in Croatia. Additionally, this is the first relevant match we’ve seen from IMTY this year. The Aussies even had difficulties handling some of the below T3 team they met in the DH Malmo Qualifier, while also having seen the departure of USTILO, who moved to Renegades. So we’re not expecting them to offer any surprises in this entry contest. But its worth noting, historically, IMTY steps it up a notch offline competition. So there’s a chance they’ll at least make it interesting. As for this match, because of the Pole’s recent struggles, the Aussies are likely the best match for the Polish-side to open the event with. Even some of their poorer performances over the mid-term have been still aligned or better than what Immunity should be able to offer. Particularly on the extended map-pool, where VP should have the edge across the board. Betting Odds are expectedly trashed with an assumed Polish victory, which as implied above we agree. With these percentages, and a day packed with games, we’re going to skip this one, since our pick Virtus.Pro practically offers no reward.
http://csgo.guru/match/436!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8713!$mouz!$SK!$SK!$0.58!$0.75!$-0.17000000000000004!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$EPL is closing the daily EU schedule with another game featuring SK and Mousesports. Just like the match we reviewed before, we really don’t believe we'll watch any surprises. And actually the form displayed by the Danish side is kinda disappointing. While on the other hand, the Germans are rolling pretty hot, and in the short-term, managed to take home several really impressive results. Additionally, its worth noting that SK basically never really focused on de_cbble, since the Danes mostly preferred Overpass instead. Unlike the Danish side, Mousesports should be way more consistent on this map, and even if they don't play it too much as well, most of the time they’ve managed to take home victories with pretty good scores. So here they are surely way more reliable than Pimp and co. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on Mousesports, so we're oriented toward sticking with the Germans one more time.
http://csgo.guru/match/439!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8720!$CLG!$AGG!$CLG!$0.6!$0.86!$-0.26!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not the most exciting contest out there, and overall a game that for ex-AGG could have a signficant influence on their latest Org-related issues. As we announced on our homepage as well, the Canadian roster has been dismissed to make space for the former (Polish) Vexed one, who re now officially representing AGG. However, it's worth remembering that prior this drop, the ex-AGG roster failed to provide any consistent shows. And with just a couple of peaks in the past month, they were one of the lineups that achieved less in this first Quarter. On the other hand, CLG are still facing their usual tendancy to be inonsistent. Mostly caused by a way to play too focused on personal plays, rather than well organized plans. However, their fire-power and map-pool knowledge is generally enough to take home a match like this, so we are not extremely concerned. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of CLG, with percentages that aren't really profitable, so you can either skip the whole thing or simply go for an Avg pick on CLG, if the inner-betting-monster sitting in your stomach is hungry and screaming.
http://csgo.guru/match/442!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8715!$VP!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.25!$0.2!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Day Two in Split, Croatia for the CounterPit Season 2 Finals, beginning with the first Semi-Final featuring matchup of teams expected to have advanced through the opening round. For their entry game, Virtus.Pro met the Oceanic qualifier Immunity which pretty much went as expected. The Poles didn't have to sweat much, finishing with a mostly dominant performance on Inferno, so it's still hard to know what to expect from them. A handful of wins in an otherwise disappointing first Quarter, they haven't really delivered anything reliable. Yet we've still seen a few flashes of the of the more threatening days, so the CIS-side knows they can't sleep on them. Natus Vincere on the other hand, surely had a more challenging task with FlipSid3 that needed all three maps to determine who was going home. But as usual, GuardiaN took the reigns and ensured NAVI would make it to the Semis. Overall, despite NAVI having not quite won as convincingly as they have in the past, and have needed to work harder, yet still getting the desired results. And are surely amongst the top 4 teams in the world. However, some of their missteps could pose an opportunity for PashaBiceps and the gang to exploit. Honestly though, we doubt NAVI will surrender more than one map to Poles. As for the maps, there good chances we'll watch de_overpass, de_mirage, and de_inferno after the Veto. If this ends up the pattern, NAVI will have small edge on Inferno, Mirage will favor VP, and Overpass could go both ways. Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of NAVI, who held a pretty decisive edge in their past meetings. However, what the Brazilians managed against the CIS in Katowice surely exposed some vulnerabilities, and we may likely again watch a match closer than expected. But we still feel NAVI is the more reliable pick, so we're going with a Low Bet on Natus Vincere.
http://csgo.guru/match/473!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8741!$Na'Vi!$Astralis!$Na'Vi!$0.48!$0.41!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Time to mess with the Counter Pit Grand-Final! In our event preview we clearly mentioned that there were extremely high chances to watch both Astralis and Natus Vincere reaching the final stage of this LAN, so at our end we're not really surprised about how the quarters/semis went (aside the upset pulled by NRG). However, Astralis are rolling into this game following a regular growth in form happened during the past months, the Danish lineup started the year kinda slowly but in the following months and in particular during the last 3 weeks, they started pushing the pedal to the metal, filling the gap from the top-3 leading teams. Here in Croatia, they managed to deliver two perfect matches, even if worth mentioning that due the NRG upset they ended into a quite 'easy' side of the bracket, while surely NAVI had to sweat way more in order to dismiss the well-ranked rosters they had to face. So yes, Astralis are surely looking really good so far, but this is going to be a pretty hard match, so don't expect to see Device and co. having an easy afternoon. On the other hand, as we mentioned above as well, Natus Vincere had to deal with a kinda messy road to the Final, they kicked-off the Quarter with a messy all-Ukrainian derby, always a tricky one, and they continued with the face-off versus VP, the Poles lately displayed promising things, even if they are still kinda out of form. At our end we're prone in believing that NAVI experienced their highest peak prior IEM Katowice, and lately their form dropped a bit, even if still quite aligned with the rest of the trending Tier-1 teams. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto will trend towards this direction, we'll enjoy a mostly balanced match, with Astralis slightly more favored on Overpass, and NAVI on Mirage, leaving Dust2 as a kinda risky middle ground. At our end, we're prone in giving the strongest momentum to the Danes, and betting odds are actually following the same direction as well. Percentages are still fine for going Low on Astralis, so this is our pick. But overall we're mostly talking about a match that can easy go either way.

With the 2nd NA Bracket for the 9th Season of CEVO underway, we move into the Quarter-Finals, for a pretty exciting matchup between the Brazilians and the Australians. We discussed in great length the level achieved in a short time by Tempo Storm, whose surge through the NA ranks began under the Games Academy banner, never slowing along the way. Most recently, Lucas and friends proved they were 'for-real' in Katowice, where they finished 2nd in their group to reach the playoffs. In the Quarters, they nearly eliminated one the world's top teams, Natus Vincere. Although the Brazilians fell 3 rounds short of reaching the Semis, what they managed against NAVI was nothing short of impressive. This performance, combined with over 2 months of mostly dominant efforts against the NA, demonstrated the threat they pose to the international scene. Meanwhile, Renegades hasn't had an active till these last few weeks. During which time, they've some mixed results, but aside from a select few of the NA's top teams, the Aussies have also been a team to watch out for. They walked over WinterFox with relative ease to reach this Quarter-Final, but we honestly don't think they'll be able to handle the Brazil-side through the extended map-pool, considering their struggles against the likes of Cloud9, Liquid, and OpTic. As for this match, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_inferno, and de_train. Assuming the Veto follows this path, Cache should favor the Aussies, Inferno will favor the Brazilians, and train could go both ways. Current Betting odds are trending in favor of Tempo, which we have to agree on, since they've been playing solid for some time now. Although we wouldn't be surprised to watch this go all three maps. Percentages are still rewarding for Low Bet on Tempo Storm, so they're our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/492!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8735!$Renegades!$TSM!$TSM!$0.58!$0.8!$-0.22000000000000008!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We're kicking-off the day with the entry game of the iBP Invitational, the recurrent iBUYPOWER North American cup that this time is sporting a $16,000 prizepool. Honestly, here we're not reviewing a really super-amazing match. The TSM roster recently passed through some lineup changes, and AdreN stepped in to fill the shoes of Vice. On paper, this should be a switch pointing towards the right direction, even if we're still talking about a team mostly lacking raw firepower, rather than brain. However, its worth noting that the North American side faced a serious lack of decent results during the whole first Quarter. And only in the past few days they started looking a tiny bit revitalized. On the other hand, Renegades aren't doing too bad. They started the month in a pretty good fashion, hitting a good streak of positive results in ESL Pro League, but lately they dropped the ball a bit, and ended up facing troubles in facing the top-trending teams of the NA scene. About maps, we're expecting to watch de_mirage, de_train and de_cbble, and if the veto will go this way, we're oriented in giving an edge to the Aussies, since they should be slightly more reliable on the extended map-pool compared to TSM. Betting odds are still decent for going with a Low pick on Renegades, so we'll stick with them.

Selfless, despite their recent roster changes, and the relevant departure of Koosta, still managed to keep floating pretty well within the NA scene. And even if their latest results turned a bit inconsistent compared to what they achieved during the first phase of the year, they are still a solid opponent for most of the North American sides around. WinterFox followed a kinda similar pattern, and while they are actually one of the most unreliable teams of the whole scene as of late, they are still delivering impressive upsets on a daily basis, and surely victories over OpTiC and Luminosity are results that cannot be scrapped. However, they generally tend to shine in BO1s games rather than BO3s, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them facing hard times if the current match is forced to a third map. About veto, we're expecting to see de_overpass, de_inferno and de_cache. If this will be the case, Overpass and Cache should be in favor of Selfless, while WinterFox may grab Inferno. Betting odds are still quite fine for going Low on Selfless, so we're oriented in taking this path since we find them slightly more on point with the extended map-pool.
http://csgo.guru/match/494!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8745!$Dignitas!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.42!$0.16!$0.26!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second half of this Swedish/Danish matchup for EPL Saturday. For the second game, we're moving to Overpass. As we discussed in the first game, Dignitas comes into the weekend with a mixed bag of results over the mid-term. They rolled over DenDD with relative ease earlier this week, by way of a clean 2-0 sweep. Not the most impressive win, but surely some positive fuel of confidence for the Danish-side. In addition, Overpass is map they've performed decently on, including a 16-10 victory over G2. So they've the ingredients to offer the Swedes a good fight. On the other hand, we're talking about one Fnatic's better maps, and one they've perfect on in 2016. In Katowice, the Swedes bested both Luminosity and Astralis on it, so despite the positives the Danish-side may carry with them, the hill is likely gonna be even steeper here. Again, Betting Odds are heavily favoring Olofmeister and friends, which correct when viewing their track record. With these percentages, we're oriented towards skipping this one, with such a busy schedule today. But if you must make a pick, our pick is Fnatic.

This time we're not really expecting any huge surprises, and overall NiP should sport a pretty decent edge over SK. In the short-term, the Danes dropped a lot in performance, particularly if we compare their latest kinda average shows with top-tier teams, they've managed to put together just a month ago. Overall, a wide part of the Tier-2 rosters are actually experiencing struggles. So we're not really surprised to see Friis and co having hard times during this phase of the season. On the other hand, NiP surely failed to deliver convincing LAN results, but overall they are on a consistent streak in EPL. During which, aside from their last game they ended up losing versus Fnatic (but the series ended 1-1), they are one of the teams that performed better. Talking about the current contest, SK are generally quite decent on de_cache. But on the other side, NiP have stepped up a lot on this map during the past months, and here the Swedes delivered solid results against most of the other Tier-1 opponents. So even if we might watch a close score, we're prone in sticking with a Low+/Avg- pick on Get_Right and friends.
http://csgo.guru/match/496!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8737!$Cloud9!$OG!$Cloud9!$0.52!$0.56!$-0.040000000000000036!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Our day packed with matches continues on, and now we move back to the iBP Invitational, for the the events last match of the day, but quite interesting matchup. For this Qtr-Final we've some high-tiered North American competition. Again, both seeds bypassed the entry round, advancing directly in the quarters. After a bit a rocky start in the early stages of the year, we've finally starting seeing some consistency from Cloud9 at a level we've always aligned their performances with. Particularly in past few weeks, where they qualified for the Columbus Major, and recently a sweep of Renegades followed by going 1-1 for their EPL set with Luminosity. The one obstruction along the way, was the Canadians they'll meet here today. OpTic on the other hand, as we mentioned before having been rolling in high form over the mid-term. But they too have been prone to the random BO1 upset, as they've fallen to both Wfx and Aussies, splitting both EPL sets. Overall, they've been amongst the hottest trending NA teams since February. As for this match, this will be the third meeting this year. C9 took the first in a BO3, while Optic evened the score, taking back-to-back ESL contests. So we're expecting quite a balanced match here today. As for the maps, we believe we'll watch de_dust2, de_inferno, and de_cbble. If the Veto follows this, C9 will have the advantage on Dust2, while Cobblestone will give the edge to Optic, leaving Inferno which could go either way. Betting Odds are currently quite balanced, giving some favor to the American-side. On our end, we're viewing this a mostly a 50/50 matchup, so we're oriented toward taking the more profitable path. So our pick is Low Bet on OpTic.

This is just another map where we don't really believe we'll watch any relevant surprise. Just like Cobblestone also here on Overpass the Brazilian side always provided pretty good performances, and played this map on a regular basis with consistent results, so they should be able to deal with CLG without sweating too much. On the other hand CLG, are always a bit random on this kind of 'new' maps, and even if they aren't too bad on it, we're not really prone in considering the North American side as a super-reliable pick, in particular since looks like that currently they are more focused in keeping their fire-power high rather than improving strats-wise. Betting odds are even more skewed than the previous contest, but still kinda decent for sticking with a Low+ pick on Luminosity, so we'll just go with FalleN and friends one more time.

Little time, so getting right to it. LG was top seed and awarded a bye through the first round. So this is their first game today. They're coming off a mediocre performance with Cloud9, where the two split the EPL set. But Overall, the Brazilians at right at the top near the Swedes, so they're surely a level above shakier American-side. Selfless on the other hand,had to work their way into this match, by sweeping WinterFox 2-0. But they had to sweat for the 2nd map, but managed to end it quickly. Overall, Relyks and co. don't quite sport the firepower to match the Brazilian-side, so we doubt they'll manage more than a single map with the extended map-pool in play. So our pick is Low Bet Luminosity, or just skip since the percentages aren't really rewarding enough.

Here we've actually a pretty interesting matchup, that may be much closer than expected. Liquid have come to form over the mid-term, setting up performances aligned with the NA Tier-1. However, their most recent matches with OpTic and Renegades were bigger tests for the Americans, resulting in a close 2-1 loss to the Canadians, and settling for 1-1 with the Aussies. Considering the fairly recent changes to the lineup, we're not surprised to see them having some issues in highend matches, but they don't seem to leveled off yet. Meanwhile, as we mentioned earlier, TSM recently added adreN to the lineup, which was sure to add some firepower, but what they managed earlier against the Australians in the entry round, what better than we anticipated. Despite their string in inconsistent results since joining the Org, they managed one of their best efforts to date, landing them a spot in this Quarter-Final. A tricky element to this matchup, is the TSM's new 5th man, who is not only familiar with Liquid's Strats, but he's also on their starting roster for the MLG Major. Surely, he can offer invaluable insights to properly counter his teammates on the other side. As for this match, despite the X-factor of adreN, we still to give the advantage to Liquid. As for the Veto, we've no match history to refer to, based on their histories, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_cbble, and de_overpass. Although Liquid should have the edge through the extended map-pol, when viewing what TSM achieved against the Aussies, their best chances will be on Cobblestone and Overpass. Betting Odds are currently skewed in favor of Liquid, which is to be expected with TSM's lineup having little history together. On our end, we wouldn't be surprised to see close scores and maybe a third map. So we're gonna wait to see how Liquid plays their other games before this one, but unless they unravel in those contests, we feel they're the more reliable pick. So we're going with a Low Bet on Liquid.

In the past few weeks the Ukrainians started struggling kinda a lot, and overall they faced more lows than peaks. On the other hand Mousesports lately faced a light drop as well, but their slightly issues can be considered kinda aligned to the ones that most of the other top-Tier2 teams experienced in the past weeks, so overall we're not really concerned by their condition. On de_overpass Mouz always displayed quite good things, so we don't believe we'll watch them sweating too much, so at our end we're oriented in picking a Low+ pick on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/546!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8775!$Ancient!$Ence!$Ancient!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite interesting game for this early batch of DH Malmo Qualifier matches. ENCE despite the promising roster, in the past months failed to provide consistent performances, and aside very few peaks, the Finns still have to find a proper pattern for moving ahead the Tier-3 mess. On the other hand Ancient are slowly improving, and after taking home the Pantamera Challenge trophy, kept offering decent shows in the following online matches as well. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch de_train, de_mirage and de_cbble. If the veto will take this path, Train and Mirage should be in slightly advantage of Pronax and co, while Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are still fine for a Low pick on Ancient, so we're oriented in sticking with them, since we find the Swedes more consistent on the extended map-pool.

SK in particular trashed most of the good results they achieved in the first Quarter of the year, and actually they are sitting on a kinda terrible losing streak. Surely in the short-term they had to mess with quite high-end rosters, but overall they could have handled them in a slightly better way, since we're mostly referring to BO1 contests. On the other hand FlipSid3 are actually following a kinda random pattern, in the past few days they mixed peaks and valleys at alarming rate, and actually we're prone in considering them as an huge question mark. Honestly we don't really understand how a roster can end losing an extremely relevant BO3 such as the one versus Ancient, and then upsetting Mousesports twice in a row in what on-paper was a way harder match. Anyway, talking about the current BO3, we're expecting to watch: de_train, de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto will go this way, Train should be in favor of the Danes, while the Ukrainians should sport an advantage on Mirage, and Overpass can easily go either way. At our end we're slightly more oriented in attempting a Low pick on FliPSid3, since we find SK kinda unreliable, but overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch a tight match.
http://csgo.guru/match/548!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8809!$WinterFox!$coL!$WinterFox!$0.55!$0.52!$0.030000000000000027!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last EPL match of this North American evening, and CompLexity and WinterFox are now moving to de_overpass for their 2nd matchup. As we already mentioned in the previous game, both rosters faced a pretty low consistency in the short-term, and overall ended suffering a wide amount of defeats. WinterFox are surely looking a bit better compared to CompLexity, and managed to achieve slightly more as well, but honestly we're referring to two lineups that kinda lost the right path, and are mostly moving ahead without a solid plan. On Overpass we'll likely enjoy a pretty balanced contest, generally WinterFox never really provided stunning performances on this map, but few days ago they somehow managed to stun Liquid on it, something not really expected and surely promising. CompLexity on the other hand, never really offered super exciting shows as well, and according to what we watched in the past weeks they should sport less chances compared to de_dust2. Betting odds are still decent for going with WinterFox, so we'll stick one more time with a Low pick on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/549!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8811!$AGG!$Ence!$AGG!$0.55!$0.72!$-0.16999999999999993!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We're kicking-off the EU evening with a BO3 for the brand new Hitbox Challenger Cup. Both teams are hitting this game after following a kinda inconsistent pattern during the past weeks, but surely AGG displayed way better things compared to ENCE. The Poles already faced the Finns yesterday, in their UCC BO3 game, and ended sweeping them 2-0 in a quite easy fashion, so today we're not really expecting huge surprises out of this re-match. As we stated several times already, ENCE are struggling since a quite long while, and even if lately they woke up a 'lil they are still offering shows way below their full potential. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_inferno, de_overpass and de_dust2. If the veto will take this path, AGG should have an edge on Overpass and Dust2, while the Finnish side may grab Inferno. Betting odds are already rolling in favor of the Poles, and at our end we're prone to agree since they are without any doubt sporting an higher momentum. So our pick is a Low one on AGG.
http://csgo.guru/match/550!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8831!$NRG!$WinterFox!$NRG!$0.58!$0.6!$-0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Third batch of North American EPL matches, and here we're reviewing a game that may lead to surprises. NRG are rolling here after ruining their positive winning streak with an impressive 2-0 loss suffered versus Cloud9. After the good shows delivered during CounterPit Finals, we were expecting to see the EU/NA mix to keep their positive momentum also within the NA scene, but things didn't exactly go so, and what they displayed versus C9 was surely way below the average potential of this roster. On the other hand, WinterFox aren't really the most consistent team out there, but if they manage to hit a good evening they may turn into a a quite problematic team to shut down. In the past we watched Anger and co. delivering pretty crazy upsets, so we wouldn't be surprised to see them doing well. Additionally de_train always been one of their best maps, so we'll likely watch a pretty tight match. Betting odds are still slightly skewed in favor of NRG, but overall this is mostly a pure 50/50 matchup, and at our end we're slightly more prone in attempting a Low pick on WinterFox, mostly because of the map they're playing on.
http://csgo.guru/match/551!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8842!$FSid3!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.35!$0.11!$0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Time to move to the first batch of ESL Pro League matches, that will warm us up before moving to the big clash between NiP and Astralis. Overall, this should pretty much be a one-way game, FlipSid3 are floating pretty fine within Tier-2, but honestly they don't really sport enough fire-power or class to compete with Fnatic. So even if Overpass is surely a map where we might watch scores closer than expected, and while the Ukrainians have always played it decently, we highly doubt we'll see Fnatic moving ahead with a loss in the bag. Particularly because over the short-term the Swedes never really struggled versus mid-tier opponents, aside from the OT loss they suffered versus mousesports on de_dust2 (but well, D2 shouldn't be used as relevant metric). However, betting odds are already trashed in favor of Fnatic, and as usual, betting on a game featuring 90/10 percentages is pretty much pointless due to the extremely low-reward. But well, if for some reason you don't want to skip, our pick is Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/552!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8839!$Penta!$Gambit!$Gambit!$0.48!$0.43!$0.04999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy match to predict. These rosters are two of the more inconsistent of the whole scene. Penta woke up slightly after the roster changes, but overall, we're still talking about a team who in the mid-term ended up losing about 85% of their matches. Even those versus rsther sub-par lineups, so we're always pretty concerned when we review their games. However, its worth mentioning that since they switched Davidp with loWel things started rolling a bit better for the German organization. On the other hand, Gambit are sporting one of the best lineups of the CIS scene, but they're still struggling in taking home relevant results, even versus teams that are sporting fire-power way below what the Russian mix is fielding. Honestly, they seem to be affected by the 'FaZe disease', that can be summed up in: great potential but recurrent sup-par performances. Anyways, for this BO3, we're expecting to watch de_cache, de_cbble and de_overpass. If the veto goes this way, Gambit may have an edge on Cache, while Cobblestone may end in favor of Penta, and Overpass is going to be pretty random. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, and we wouldn't be surprised to see the 3rd map kicking-in. However at our end we're oriented in giving an edge to the CIS side, so our pick is a Low Bet on Gambit, since we find them slightly above the level of the Germans.
http://csgo.guru/match/553!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8846!$Selfless!$NRG!$Selfless!$0.53!$0.51!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Aside from the pair of EPL matches scheduled for this evening, we also have some Cevo League to turn our attention toward for what should actually be a really interesting matchup. As we discussed yesterday, Selfless has been a team of many peaks and valleys, but some of the peaks they're achieving continually get higher over time, as the American bunch keep managing to set up some pretty impressive outings. The win over Luminosity remains the most notable, but again last night they put up a couple of rather solid performances, where they successfully took back to back maps from a typically dangerous OpTic roster. Since NRG rose from the ashes of the former Method squad, they've managed to put together a more stable EU/NA lineup,which so far has been mostly aligned as a Tier-2 team. Aside from a few losses against some of Top Tier, such as Astralis and Luminosity, they've so far proven to be a legitimate NA contender. They'll come into the evening's games following a pair of solid wins of WinterFox, taking both EPL contests. So overall, we're looking a pretty balanced matchup. As for this match, we're in the Cevo Qtr-finals of the 2nd NA bracket where the winner will secure a spot in the Gfinity LAN Finals. The winner of this BO3 will advance to the semis to face LG, which will in turn determine the other grand-final contender vs CLG. So the stakes are certainly raised due to the new Cevo format. Regarding the maps, theres good chances we'll watch: de_cache, de_mirage, and de_inferno. Should we see these picks come out of the Veto, Selfless will have an edge on Inferno, NRG slightly advantaged on Mirage, and Cache could easily go either way. Betting Odds are currently skewed slightly in favor of relyks and the gang. On our end, we agree in seeing them a bit more reliable on the extended map-pool. yet , while we're expecting a pretty even fight where close scores and possible OT will be needed, we're a bit more oriented toward playing the percentages, and going with a Low Bet on NRG for the more profitable reward.

As we mentioned in the Semis as well, HR are rolling into this match following a good streak of victories. But it is worth noting that they were sitting in a relatively easy side of the bracket. Aside from the game against Preparation, they managed to move through it without sweating too much. On the other hand, E-Frag followed quite a similar pattern, suffering just a single loss versus CPH Wolves. But overall, they've surely faced more obstacles along their road here, with both Dignitas and Epsilon being pretty tough sides to mess with. Talking about the current match, we're expecting to watch de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_inferno. If the veto will go this way, Inferno should be in favor of HellRaisers, while Overpass may go to E-Frag and Dust2 is mostly a pure 50/50 contest. Betting odds are currently a bit too skewed in favor of the Slovakian side, while honestly we're expecting a pretty balanced matchup. So at our end, we're slightly more prone toward attempting a Low pick on E-Frag in order to attempt catching a higher reward.
http://csgo.guru/match/564!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8915!$Astralis!$Gambit!$Astralis!$0.6!$0.85!$-0.25!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another MLG Columbus match that shouldn't cast any major upset. Astralis are actually the favored team for topping Group C, and according to what they've displayed in the short-term, their current level should be well aligned with the shows offered by the trending Tier-1 teams. Surely the Danes have been a bit slow in regaining their form after the switch from TSM to Astralis, but honestly they never really experienced huge down-peaks as many other T1 sides have done, while mostly floating in calm water. Overall we don't believe that Device and co will suffer major hits prior to the Quarter-Finals. On the other hand Gambit are actually one of the most promising CIS teams around. Surely they are still kinda inconsistent and far from perfect in BO3 games, but honestly we wouldn't be surprised to see DOSIA THE X GOD and co. doing fairly well in the BO1s, and eventually hitting some decent scores if they're able to force their opponents on to neutral maps, such as Dust2. However, even if they might offer a sexy show, we highly doubt we'll watch Gambit taking down an established team as Astralis, and so our pick is an Avg one on the Danish side. However worth mentioning that the current Betting Odds are edging the 90/10 mark, so we aren't really talking about a profitable match, and you should seriously evaluate a plain skip.

CSGL has recently shown some signs of stability, as they've managed to add two event dates to their calander. The Poles in the past months have seem to regain some consistency they've been in absence of, generally, for quite some time. And in March alone, they successful managed to secure their tickets for both DH Malmo, and just the other day adding DH Austin as well. And bring with them today, actually a decent winning streak and set of positive peformances. Meanwhile ALTERNATE aTTaX has really fall in a hard times recetly, in contrast to the Polish-side have collected a stretch of dispappointing outings. While CSGL was grabbing theor spot in DH, the Germans failed to even threaten in the closed qualifiy. And as for this matchup, they may likely manage to puch the contetst to a third map, but overall, we doubt they manage to upset the Poles while running on their current peak. So on our end, we're in agreement with percentages trendoing in favor of the Poles, so on our end, we're oriented in going with a Low Bet on CSGL, with expectation of watching them continue perform at a level on par with much of the Tier-2.
http://csgo.guru/match/672!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8929!$NiP!$LG!$LG!$0.48!$0.28!$0.19999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$MLG Columbus is now moving to the most relevant matches of the evening, and in particular this one featuring the faceoff between NiP and Luminosity is going to be one of the greatest we'll enjoy today. As we mentioned in our preview as well, the Swedes are actually playing with Threat instead of Pyth due Visa issues occurred prior the event, despite this kinda major issue, F0rest and friends still managed to take home their entry game versus FlipSid3 and overall they seemed capable to move to Playoffs. Worth mentioning that the Ukrainians looked way more on-point on LAN compared to online, so the OT win that NiP achieved over them should be considered as relevant. On the other hand Luminosity started quite slow as well, and even if they didn't hit any Overtime versus Mousesports, still left 13 rounds on the ground. Actually the Brazilians are one of the hottest teams around, they played a brilliant first Quarter, and on LAN they proved to be one of the teams to beat, so would be interesting to see how they'll deal with the recently revitalized Swedes. About the map, in our opinion there are good chances to watch Mirage or Cache, and both should be kinda balanced. Here the question mark is mostly Threat, and guessing how he will play is basically impossible. Betting odds are currently way too skewed towards Luminosity, and while the Brazilians are surely advantaged, we find that percentages should be more aligned to the middle, so we're oriented in risking a Low pick on NiP, with the hope to catch the Jackpot.

After two days of action, we're moving to the extended map-pool for the Decider matches featuring BO3s. Naturally, we'll begin with Group A with a mostly expected matchup. Mousesports began yesterday's festivities with an incredibly intense battle vs FlipSid3 which required multiple overtimes. Honestly, it was one of the stranger games we've seen in some time, since both sides had 12-3 CT-sides sparking the ot-derby. But the Germans resilience saw them to a 31-28 finished. However, it's worth noting, despite they managed to comeback in a beautiful fashion as CT, like happened also in their entry game with Luminosity, their T-side was again very impotent. Such a pattern is surely destined to end badly in a game featuring the BO3 format. Meanwhile, NiP also had to dismiss the Ukranians in OT, only that was their entry game. But in contrast to the German side, the Swedes were far less competitive against LG in their winners' match. On Mirage, f0rest and the gang failed to gain any momentum in a disappointing 16-5 tilt. Considering the NiP form in recent weeks, this kind of result was surely surprising, even against the Brazilians (worth noting that playing with Threat vs LG delivered huge issues). But we're certainly expected far different showing while facing elimination. As mentioned, we've moved to the BO3, and here we're expecting to watch: de_mirage, de_dust2, and de_overpass as maps. If the Veto follows this path, Mouz will have the edge on Mirage, while NiP should favored on Dust, and Overpass could go either way. Betting Odds are actually quite balanced even if still moving around, but currently favoring Mouz. On our end, we're oriented toward seeing the absence of Pyth surely significant, but overall mitigated by the extended map-pool, so we're slightly more oriented in going Low on NiP.
http://csgo.guru/match/675!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8954!$Ence!$AGG!$Ence!$0.45!$0.19!$0.26!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Taking a brief step away from the MLG Major, as we move back to Operation Kinguin for a rematch of recently fought contest for various leagues. Ence has had a very discouraging month, after beginning with the org earning more desirable results. Recently in Copenhagen, we watched the Finns fail to even reach the playoffs, and being quickly bounced after a couple of lackluster shows matches vs Publiclir.se and Plantronics. Which was honestly a bit surprising, considering the firepower of the Finnish-side. And in this match, they'll playing without the services of allu, relying on former NiP coach, Natu, to fill the vacancy, which will surely make a turnaround even more unlikely. Meanwhile, by comparison, AGG has had a better track record in the short term, since the former Vexed crew sign with the new Org. After the Poles failed to secure a spot in DH Malmo, when losing to Dignitas in the Qualifier, they moved on to roll over Ence in UCC and Hitbox matches. But on the whole, the Polish side still continues to put forth an inconsistent level play that needs improved to regain the threatening form we saw rising from them under their former banner. As for this match, we're really not expecting any surprises, particularly considering the one sided affair between them recently, combined with the Finns' lineup change. As far maps go, there good chances we'll watch de_overpass, de_dust2, and de_inferno. Assuming this Veto goes this way, Ence will have a slight edge on Inferno, while Dust and Overpass will advantage AGG. Betting Odds are currently skewed in favor of the Poles, which we have to agree with, largely due to their greater reliability. If percentages stay decent enough for Low Bet on AGG, we're oriented toward taking this path as well.

After filtering through half the talent pool, we'll move into the Quarter-Finals, and surely an amazing one to get things started today. Natus Vincere has gone mostly unimpeded through the group stage, finishing atop the 'Group of Death' and bypassing the decider matches. Even though GuardiaN and friends are favorites to reach the Grand-Final, honestly, we weren't expecting them to roll over Cloud9 and Virtus.Pro as convincingly as they did. The momentum they gained in their run leading up to the Trophy won at the Counter Pit S2 Finals, carried through some online dominance of EnvyUs, and still here in Columbus. So they are undoubtedly in high form to make another deep run the year's first Major. On the other hand, NiP has also been performing very well in the past few weeks, but as we covered earlier THREAT is standing in for Pyth, due to Visa issues. So the Swedes were at a disadvantage from the start. However, the team's coach has stepped up well enough to ensure this Playoffs appearance. The lineup was a little shaky at first, but still managed to survive FlipSid3 in Overtime during the entry game. But dealing with Luminosity was a test beyond their current capabilities. GeT_RiGHT leaded the charge against Mousesports in the following Decider, for an overall Solid performance earning them the playoff berth. Recently, this matchup has been mostly one sided as far as the results go. As far as maps, we'll likely watch de_overpass, de_inferno, and de_mirage. If the Veto goes this way, NiP may have an edge on Inferno, while Overpass and Mirage will favor NAVI. As expected, betting Odds are rolling in favor of Flamie and co. On our end, we're of similar mind, seeing NAVI peaking too well right now, for the Swedish roster to upset. So Natus Vincere is our pick for a Low Bet.

Yesterday Astralis incredibly managed to dismiss Fnatic, something not really expected (even if at our end we picked an ICB on the Danes), and overall looked extremely on-point. Surely hitting a 2-0 sweep is kinda a flash in the dark, in particular since JW and co. always been really prepared in matches featuring the extended map-pool. On the other hand, Natus Vincere are currently sitting on a pretty impressive streak, and here in Columbus they had a pretty streamlined run so far, dismissing all their opponents in a quite easy fashion. Even the tough ones (VP and NiP). Actually with Fnatic out from the Major, GuardiaN and the boys are the favored team for hitting the Grand-Final. About maps, we're expecting to watch de_dust2, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will take this path, Dust2 can easily go either way, while Mirage should be in favor of NAVI and Astralis may grab Overpass. Overall this is basically a pure 50/50 contest, Astralis looked really in form yesterday, and if they'll manage to keep their momentum we wouldn't be surprised to watch them continuing their streak. At our end we're slightly more oriented in picking a Low bet on Dupreeh and the gang due the slightly more rewarding percentages, but without any doubt we'll watch a contest sporting all the 3 maps and maybe OTs.

However, in the short-term AGG mostly took home a mixed bag of results, and since they moved out from Vexed they turned even more inconsistent than usual, in particular against low-tier teams. On the extended map-pool they generally sport a decent advantage, and they should be capable to grab at least two maps, even if worth noting that just few days ago against ENCE, the Poles looked pretty out-of-form and ended losing with kinda embarrassing scores. On the other hand, Epsilon are just the usual swe.mix, pretty deadly and prone to deliver upsets in BO1s, but generally not an huge threat in BO3s. They are moving here after a pretty average run at Copenhagen games, followed by a couple of decently close online matches, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Swedes taking home at least a map in this contest. About the Veto, in our opinion we'll watch de_cache, de_dust2 and de_train. If the veto will go this way, Dust2 should be in favor of Epsilon, while Train may go to AGG and Cache can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently rolling in favor of AGG. This is surely correct, but honestly the actual percentages are kinda too skewed, so at our end we're slightly more oriented in risking a Low pick on Epsilon, with the hope to catch the higher reward.

Liquid are joining this game following their entry games versus Cloud9, so we're expecting them to be pretty well warmed up. However, its worth noting that de_cbble isn't really a map that Hiko and the gang play on a regular basis. But despite this, they've always managed to achieve respectable results on it, at least within the NA scene. On the other hand OpTiC have been on a break for a couple of weeks, and their latest victories over Luminosity are just 'free wins' due to LG not able to attend the games. Previously OpTiC were rolling pretty decently, but honestly we're not sure about how the prolonged break will affect their gameplay. Just like Liquid, Shahzam and co. also never really put too much effort on Cobblestone, so this surely boosts our concerns regarding their form, making them a kinda unreliable pick. Betting odds are trending in favor of Liquid, but percentages are still acceptable for a Low pick on the Hiko's boys, so we're oriented in sticking with them.

However, worth noting that Escape are one of the most promising teams around, so HR weren't messing with an easy game. On the other hand CSGL lately managed to hit a quite surprising streak of good performances, something quite unusual for the Polish team, even if we've to say that during the past month Minise and the gang finally managed to step-up a bit, and actually they are looking way more solid than before. In particular their show against [Ancient] stunned us a bit, since the Swedes were coming from a really consistent week. Talking about this match, we're expecting to watch de_overpass, de_train and de_cache. If the veto will take this way, the Poles should be advantaged on Overpass, while HellRaisers may grab Train, and Cache will be mostly 50/50. Overall we're messing with a quite balanced match, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch it hitting the 3rd map and close scores in general. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, and aligned to the middle, so at our end we're oriented in going for a Low pick on CSGL, since we find them slightly more focused than HR.

SK near the end of Q1 experienced a relevant drop in performances, and moved from being ranked in the high Tier-2 to the bottom, honestly this is still a team sporting a pretty great potential together with really experienced players, so we're expecting them to bounce back soon, however we've to say that actually their latest displays were kinda inconsistent and overall they aren't really looking as extremely reliable. On the other hand, Gambit are moving here after a pretty good show at MLG Columbus, the CIS side stunned everybody by sending EnVyUs packing, prior falling short in the Decider match against CLG, in a pretty tense game that reached the 3rd map. Anyway, worth mentioning that Gambit never really excelled in online matches, and even if lately they surely stepped up a lot, and clearly displayed this improvement on LAN as well, we highly doubt we'll watch them taking more than a map against the Danes. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, but at our end we're slightly more oriented in picking a Low bet on SK, since we believe they've the higher chances to hit a 2-0 (but we'll likely watch just a Tie).
http://csgo.guru/match/684!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9001!$FSid3!$NiP!$NiP!$0.42!$0.3!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$First EPL match of the day, and we're starting with a pretty interesting contest between two teams that are just back from MLG Columbus. NiP are finally fielding their official roster again, so Threat moved back to his usual coach position, and Pyth is playing instead. Worth mentioning that the Swedes despite the last-minute change, still provided a pretty consistent show in Columbus, and honestly with their starting 5 they could have been one of the contenders for the Final. However, we're pretty sure that their time will come again, in particular now that most of the key players of the other top-tier teams are experiencing injuries (Olofmeister &amp; GuardiaN). On the other hand, we weren't really expecting amazing stuff from FlipSid3 during the Major, but after-all the Ukrainians surely played better than forecasted, forcing NiP into OT during their entry match, and doing the same versus Mousesports in a game that will be remembered as one of the longest in the CS:GO history (finished 28-31). So we can definitely say that Markeloff and friends moved oversea pretty prepared, and overall offered a way more consistent show compared to their average online results. Talking about the current matchup, worth mentioning that de_overpass isn't really a map where NiP used to provide great things, and generally they favor Cobblestone over it. So even if the Swedes are surely fielding way more fire-power compared to Fsid3, we wouldn't be surprised to watch Markeloff and the gang offering a good show, in particular since on this map they already managed to take down NAVI, Mouz and finished 13-16 versus Fnatic. Betting odds are a bit too skewed in favor of NiP, so despite they are surely advantaged, at our end we're slightly more oriented in risking an ICB on FlipSid3, mostly because we find that this game is sporting a pretty decent upset chance.
http://csgo.guru/match/685!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9008!$AGG!$Gambit!$Gambit!$0.48!$0.3!$0.18!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another qualifier match for the first season of ECS, but for this one, we should see a rather balanced matchup. Since AGG dumped the old team and signed the Poles formerly of Vexed, AGG has been a more dangerous opponent. But despite a promising start for the lineup in the Malmo Qualifier potential, they fell 1 round shy of qualifying, and have been generally inconsistent since. So far in this Qualifier, they failed to get much momentum in their favor, following an 0-2 set with HellRaisers and 1-1 with SK. As a result, greater importance has been placed on this match between the two bottom teams of the Group. Gambit on the other hand, has been an interesting squad to follow. By the time this contest arrives, the Russians will already two matchups under their belt today. So regardless of the outcomes, they should have be somewhat advantaged by the warmups leading up to this game. We've already covered their current form in the previous games, so we'll just add Dosia and friends are overall in higher form they were in their first meeting with the Poles in March, so we've higher hopes for them, this time round. Current Betting Odds are fairly skewed in favor of Gambit, but real-world odds are much closer to even, favoring the Russians 52/48. On our end, we're inclined to favor them as well, but considering what happened with efrag, we suggest waiting a bit to see how they respond against HR. Assuming the results aren't as poor as today's entry game, our pick is Low Bet Gambit.
http://csgo.guru/match/687!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9036!$AGG!$Empire!$AGG!$0.52!$0.48!$0.040000000000000036!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy match to predict. AGG are coming into this match following an extremely long streak of disappointing results, the Polish side is actually experiencing a pretty serious slump, and seems kinda unable to bounce back in the short-term. So despite in normal conditions the Poles should be fairly advantaged over Empire, we aren't really oriented in considering Hyper and co. as a reliable pick. On the other hand Empire finally managed to adjust their gameplay in a way suitable for messing with the European sides, and in the past week they managed to perform pretty fine against most of the Tier-3 opponents they faced. In particular worth mentioning the 2-0 over Alpha (while their victory over Penta is kinda irrelevant due DDOS). Talking about the current match, we're expecting to watch de_cbble, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will take this way, Cobblestone should be in favor of AGG, Mirage may go either way, and Overpass could end in favor of Empire. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Russian side, but honestly this is a pretty balanced match and we wouldn't be surprised to watch close scores. At our end we're slightly more oriented in going Low- on Empire, mostly because their stronger momentum.
http://csgo.guru/match/688!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9043!$EchoFox!$Splyce!$EchoFox!$0.55!$0.62!$-0.06999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not much on the schedule for tonight's North American matches, but we do have one late addition, a lower tiered contest for Faceit's ECS first Season qualifier. Over the past two days, the Round Robin stage for the qualifier went underway, and it was Echo Fox who finished at the top of the NA Group. Aside from a single match over month ago, this was really the first look we've had at the newly formed roster. Although they weren't grouped with the scariest teams, they still managed to defeat all three other participants going 2-0 in each contest. Considering some the firepower they sport, this wasn't the most unexpected of results, but still impressive as a start for the new team who overall put up performances mostly aligned with NA mid tiered teams. Previous invites for this qualifier SPLYCE managed the automatic spot in the BO5 semis. The last show we saw from them was in Columbus for the Major, where they were quickly eliminated after their first two games. This wasn't surprising though, since they've lost pretty much all of their contests in the mid term, aside from the few games they won to qualify for the Major. Which from a broader view, seems to have been mostly a fluke. So they arrive here riding a fairly lengthy losing streak, and surely hope to benefit from the extended map pool solely as a team with more experience playing together across the maps. As for this game, even as kind of a random matchup, we've to give the edge to Echo Fox who sports slightly higher ceiling based on individual capabilities. But the extended maps certainly favors Splyce a bit. Otherwise, theres not too much else to add. Overall, we're in agreement with Betting Odds trending in favor of ryx and the gang, since they've shown as much promise this week alone, as we've seen from Splyce in recent weeks, especially in their online games. So our pick is Low Bet on Echo Fox.
http://csgo.guru/match/689!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9052!$Astralis!$mouz!$Astralis!$0.58!$0.81!$-0.2300000000000001!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$We're kicking-off the Sunday with the Esports Championship Series opening match, scheduled to start pretty early in the EU afternoon. On paper this is looking like a quite interesting matchup, Astralis had a decent run at MLG Columbus, where after topping their Group and surprisingly dismissing Fnatic with a 2-0 sweep, ended losing by measure versus Natus Vincere, finishing their Major run at the Semi-Finals. Overall the Danes are one of the most consistent Tier-1 rosters, and even if lately they are kinda free of relevant peaks, they never really suffered against low-tier opponents, so we don't think they'll face relevant issues versus Mouz. On the other hand Mousesports offered a decent show in the MLG COlumbus Group Stage, where they had a close match versus Luminosity, and then managed to beat FLipSid3 in a game that lasted hours due multiple Overtimes, prior falling against NiP in the Decider. Worth mentioning that yesterday they also conquered a spot for this league (ECS), by rolling over HellRaisers in the BO5 Final, displaying decent things but also a lack of focus that allowed HR to take the game to the fifth map. Talking about the current match, we're expecting to watch de_dust2, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will take this path, we wouldn't be surprised to watch Mousesports taking Dust2, while both Mirage and Overpass should be in favor of Astralis. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of the Danish side, without any doubt they are well advantaged, and the BO3 format is in their favor too, but honestly the current percentages aren't really profitable. So as usual when we talk about values floating around 85/15, we're slightly more oriented in attempting an ICB. In this case on Mousesports.
http://csgo.guru/match/690!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9063!$FSid3!$Method!$FSid3!$0.7!$0.88!$-0.18000000000000005!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Not the most relevant match out there, and honestly we don't expect huge surprises out from this game. FlipSid3 are actually sitting on a pretty terrible losing streak, and honestly we were expecting them to perform a bit better versus Dignitas, however worth mentioning that in the short-term the Ukrainians mostly faced top-tier rosters, and even at MLG Columbus (despite the early elimination) they managed to put up extremely promising fights, threatening both NiP and Mousesports in risky Overtimes. So we don't think they'll face relevant issues in dismissing Method. On the other hand, the Russian side still have to setup a viable set of strats for messing with the European sides, and in the past weeks they failed to provide performances on par with the Tier-3, so their current chances of offering a serious fight versus Markeloff and friends are pretty limited. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of FlipSid3, and dropping a bet here is not going to be profitable at all, so you should evaluate a plain skip. But if you want to pick a side anyway, the way to go is FlipSid3.

This will actually be a re-match from about a week ago, where the Swedes swept the Poles 2-0 in the UB Final. As we've mentioned in previous matches, Epsilon, formerly 'CG', are yet another dangerous swedish mix. They provided a couple decent shows in the Copenhagen Games, but have generally failed to deliver any upset results in most of the relevant ranked matchups. However, they've most steadily improved in recent weeks, and kinda surprisingly dominated today's counterparts in their first meeting, including a stunning 16-2 outing on Dust2. And despite being less favored on the extended map-pool, the 1 map advantage surely bridges that gap. AGG on the other hand, haven't really been able to string together much consistency since signing with their new org. And since falling in the Upper Bracket Final, aside from a not so exciting victory over Empire, they haven't managed to turn their fortunes in the right direction, losing to HellRaisers and SK, along with multiple defeats to Gambit. So although they should benefit from the extended maps, we've some concerns for the current trajectory of Hyper and the gang. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Swedish side. Concern the outcome of the previous encounter, paired with the UB map advantage, we're hesitant to see them taking 3 before the Swedes take 2. So while percentages are still decent for a Low Bet on Epsilon, we're oriented toward taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/695!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9098!$Godsent!$G2!$Godsent!$0.45!$0.39!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an obvious game as may look at first sight. Gamers2 suffered a pretty heavy defeat in their entry match versus CLG, surely we knew that it was a complex game, in particular after the pretty good things displayed by the North American roster in Columbus. But honestly we weren't really expecting to see just another kinda embarrassing score in an opening match, in particular right after the 16-1 that G2 suffered in Ohio. However it happened, and there isn't really much to write about it, since basically Shox and co. never really showed up. On the other hand GodSent experienced a similar fate, even if worth mentioning that they were messing with Natus Vincere, the team currently leading our World Ranking. But we need to say that the final score isn't really representative of the opener, since the first half ended 13-2 in favor of the Ukrainians, and Pronax and the gang managed to climb back in the 2nd half mostly because NAVI dropped the ball a bit, and just controlled the initial advantage without pushing too hard. Anyway, according to what we watched in both the entry matches, we're expecting to enjoy a pretty balanced match, even if at our end we believe that Gamers2 will wake up in a similar way they did during the Major, so we're slightly more prone in picking a Low bet on them rather than trying our luck with GodSent.
http://csgo.guru/match/698!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9108!$SK!$Preparation!$SK!$0.58!$0.75!$-0.17000000000000004!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the few non-DreamHack Malmo games scheduled for the evening, and actually an extremely hard matchup to predict since both rosters are generally quite prone in experiencing peaks and valleys. SK in the short-term woke up a little, but overall they are still kinda below the level they managed to hit during late February. However in the past couple of weeks they dismissed Virtus.Pro twice and CPH Wolves, surely a couple of remarkable results, even if generally the Danes are kinda prone in tilting in games featuring the extended map-pool rather than in BO1s (but here shouldn't be an huge issues, since both teams basically share the same favorite maps). On the other hand, there isn't much to say about Preparation, the Danish mix is surely including several extremely talented players, but currently they aren't really solid and overall way too aim-based for offering consistent show in BO3s, something we observed during Copenhagen Games as well. About maps, we'll likely watch de_cbble, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will go so, we should enjoy a pretty balanced match since both rosters displayed good things on these maps. At our end we're slightly more prone in picking a Low bet on SK because we find them a bit more advantaged by the match format compared to Preparation. After beginning the year with some momentum, where SK were on the verge of breaking into the Tier1, they quickly began losing traction after failing to qualify for the MLG Major. Over the following weeks, plagued with issues of inconsistency, the Danes struggled even in subT3 bouts. Despite being favored at the Copenhagen Games, they were bounced in the Qtrs. Since the, however, Friis and co. seemed to have turned a corner, and in April have once again began playing closer to their prior form earlier in the year. And they enter this match after a couple of wins over Virtus.Pro and CPH Wolves. Preparation on the other hand are still trying to make their mark. They're surely another promising squad of Danes, but remain a good step behind much of the Pro scene. They're high point thus far in the year was finishing 3rd place at the Pantamera Challenge. Otherwise, they've yet to manage any other relevant victories, but to their credit, they have managed respectable scores in most of their ranked contests, forcing the caliber of HellRaisers and Dignitas to sweat a bit for the wins. So although, we're not expecting any surprises from them today, they're certainly a promising group we'll watching in the coming months. Betting Odds are rolling in favor of SK, which we are aligned with. Percentages are still acceptable for a Low Bet on SK, so we'll stick with them for our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/699!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9120!$Escape!$Gambit!$Escape!$0.48!$0.42!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$As we're reach the midway point of DreamHack, we share our attention with a pretty balanced matchup provided by Operation Kinguin. This is actually quite an interesting contest between two teams that've taken decent strides over the mid term, pushing the boundaries of both their capabilities. After falling just short of claiming the title at the Pantamera Challenge, Escape quickly rebounded and won Uprise Champions Cup EU and continued on a month long winning streak, including noteworthy victories over CSGL and HellRaisers. Along the same journey, after some time playing without support as 'Orgless', coupled with the newfound stability of the Eu mix was rewarded with new sponsorship. Although they arrive here after a subpar loss to F3, they're still among the growing mix of T3 Challengers pushing their way through the Pro scene. Meanwhile, another group of promising newcomers, Gambit, quickly made their presence known throughout the International scene in Columbus for the Major Main Qualifier. Victories over Cloud9 and Renegades landed them their first Major appearance. Even though they didn't survive the Group Stage, Dosia and friends proved they're 'for real'. They arrive here after a couple solid wins over AGG and Penta, with hopes of keeping the streak going. As for this match, the first between the two, but surely a fairly even contest. Escape will need to rely on their strats to combat the the superior firepower of Russians. As for the maps, theres decent chances to watch de_cbble, de_cache, and de_mirage. If the Veto follows this pattern, Cache should favor Gambit, while Escape will be advantaged on Cobblestone, leaving Mirage that could go both ways. Betting Odds are still fairly balanced, but trending in favor of the Russians. On our end, we're inclined to giving them the edge as well, while we'll likely watch this reach the third map. So we'll go with a Low Bet on Gambit.

GodSent started their journey suffering a 16-11 defeat versus Natus Vincere, mostly triggered due to a far too risky map pick. However they quickly moved back on track and surprisingly managed to reach playoffs following victories over CLG and Gamers2.Ttwo matches that were far from easy, particularly for a newly formed roster. Anyway this event surely shed some light on the very high potential of this roster, and we'll likely watch them doing pretty well in the future too. On the other hand, Mousesports are actually the team showing the best things within the 2nd Tier. In the short-term, the German mix looked extremely consistent and have become a serious threat to Tier-1 rosters as well. Here in Malmo they hit the top of their Group, and forced others to the Deciders, such as Luminosity and Liquid, so ChrisJ and his gang are surely peaking right now and offering performances way above their average. Its worth mentioning that we now have moved to the BO3 format we might watch them slowing down their run a bit. About maps, we'll likely watch de_cbble, de_cache and de_train. If the Veto will take this way, Cache should be in favor of Mouz, while Train may go to GodSent and Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Mousesports, and this is correct since the Germans should sport a more complete knowledge on the extended map-pool compared to Pronax and friends. At our end we're prone in sticking with Mousesports as well, but honestly this is going to be a quite even game and we wouldn't be surprised to watch OTs and close scores.

We're kicking off the morning with the amazing contest between Natus Vincere and EnVyUs. The Frenchmen finally managed to comeback from their hellish stretch of performances, and after a couple of pretty disappointing months, here in Malmo they finally managed to find their dimension, providing a series of great shows that clearly resemble their golden times. KennyS and friends started their Swedish adventure by suffering a 16-14 in the opening BO1 versus Tempo Storm, but after the initial shock, they quickly re-adjusted and stormed over FaZe in the following game, and then they took their revenge over the Brazilians by delivering a 2-1 victory in the Decider. Yesterday they completed their good run to the Semis by demolishing Dignitas in impressive fa shion. Actually the French players are mostly offering good individual personal shows, rather than an extremely polished teamplay. This is surely encouraging from that aspect, (KennyS is a monster when on-point), but at our end, we're not totally sure that will be enough to take down NAVI, particularly if we enjoy strats-intensive maps such as Cobblestone and Train. Natus Vincere are without a doubt stepping here as favored for conquering a spot in the Grand-Final, as they did a couple of weeks ago at MLG Columbus as well. In the past few days the Ukrainian mix dismissed all their opponents. They had to sweat a bit during the BO1 phase, but as soon as GuardiaN moved back into the roster for Playoffs, the wind changed, and NAVI clearly reminded us why they are actually on the top of our World Ranking. Talking about the current match, we're expecting to watch de_cbble, de_train and de_dust2 as maps. If the veto will take this path, Train is in obvious favor of NAVI, while EnVyUs may grab Cobblestone, and Dust2 can easily go either way. Betting odds are actually trending in favor of GuardiaN and his gang, which is surely correct according to the progression that NAVI experienced in the current Quarter. However, its worth noting that the current percentages are a bit too skewed, and overall we're referring to a game that will probably reach map-3 and may trigger some OTs as well, so watch out. While at our end, we find Natus Vincere a bit more reliable on the extended map-pool, so we'll stick with a Low pick on them.

We already discussed extensively about EnVyUs and Mousesports in the previous contest, where we analyzed the current good moment experienced by Mouz, actually offering the most solid performances in the Tier-2. And we also looked into the not so exciting performances that EnVyUs put together, still way below their average despite the decent run at DreamHack Malmo. While the first game on de_inferno may end in favor of the Frenchmen, here on Cache we'll likely enjoy a way more balanced contest. On this map the German mix always offered pretty solid shows, and in the short-term they managed to take down GodSent, Luminosity and NiP, so obviously they are joining this match with the right cards to achieve just another relevant victory. Betting odds are actually rolling in the Mouz direction as well, mostly because the good shows we listed above. At our end we're kinda prone in agreeing with this trend, since we find Cache one of the best maps for Mouz together with Dust2, so our pick is a Low bet on Mousesports.

FaZe after the promising 2-1 over Virtus.Pro failed to bounce back in full force, falling short versus Astralis right after. Additionally few hours ago they also missed their chance to setup a proper fight against EnVyuS, losing their ECS contest by measure. As we already stated several times already, Fox and friends are navigating through bad waters since a while, and despite all the personal talent, the roster is still struggling through a roller coaster of mixed and generally disappointing results. On the other hand Fnatic, as we mentioned several times during the past days, are playing with Plessen as stand-in due the Olofmeister injury, however this didn't prevent the Swedes to take home a victory in their yesterday's entry match versus NAVI, and overall offering a decent show in the 2nd as well (even if they ended losing). This match is taking place on de_train, and generally on this map Fnatic always managed to put up pretty solid fights, so we're oriented in giving them a decent edge, even if they're playing without one of their Key players. Betting odds are still acceptable for a Low+/Avg- pick on JW and friends, so we're oriented in sticking with Fnatic.

Mousesports are currently sporting a pretty great momentum, and actually they're the team to beat within the Tier-2. In the past few weeks they managed to take home extremely relevant results over a wide amount of top-ranked Tier-1 rosters, such as EnVyUs and Luminosity, and today they're joining this game as slightly favored thanks to their generally solid shows on de_cache. On the other hand Virtus.pro are still kinda far away from the peaks of the past year, and after a decent show at the MLG Major and a barely acceptable run at DreamHack Malmo they already started struggling again in their online matches, the Poles yesterday suffered a pretty heavy 2-1 loss versus FaZe, something not really expected after the promising things displayed in early April. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of the German mix, and this is kinda obvious according to the fact that de_cache is together with de_dust2 one of the best maps for Mouz, so they're surely joining here with a slightly edge. However we find these percentages a bit too extreme, while the match should be kinda even after-all. So we might attempt a Low- pick on the Virtus.pro roulette, with the hope to win the jackpot.

On the other hand, E-Frag generally always offered slightly more consistent shows compared to AGG, but in the short-term the Bulgarians are experiencing a pretty relevant amount of peaks and valleys, and overall the team isn't offering solid results as during the early part of April, when they managed to score a quite good winning streak. Talking about maps, we're expecting to watch de_mirage, de_overpass and de_cache. If the veto will take this path, Mirage may end in favor of AGG, while E-Frag should be advantaged on both Overpass and Cache.

However, honestly we believe that LG are a bit underestimated, this doesn't mean that you have to bet on them or that they're going to beat NaVi, but just that their lineup, featuring Pyth + DevilWalk may perform a bit better than expected, and provide a decent challenge in at least a map. Anyway, talking about the betting-side, this is a plain skip.

Honestly, despite VP didn't play in a brilliant way during the past weeks, we highly doubt we'll watch them losing a Bo3 against Tempo, and the chances to watch Pasha and friends winning here are pretty decent. Although the odds aren't exceptional, so you can either skip or go for an Avg bet on VP. Personally I don't enjoy betting when the percentages are below 82/18.
http://csgo.guru/match/1175!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4668!$Cloud9!$CLG!$Cloud9!$0.6!$0.88!$-0.28!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Pretty interesting NA derby, C9 are for sure doing great internationally, and they managed to achieve 3 GrandFinals in a row, so we can easily say that their form is currently pretty high, and there are good chance to watch them hitting a Final one more time. On the other hand CLG are playing with a stand-in (Sancz instead of FNS) and this is a change we need to evaluate in a couple of matches, before dropping an unbiased opinion. Overall we doubt we'll watch CLG grabbing more than a map, and C9 should be able to win the match anyway. About maps, we'll likely watch : de_dust2, de_inferno and de_cache. Anyway, CSGL odds aren't exceptional, so just like the previous game you can either skip or go Avg on C9.
http://csgo.guru/match/1176!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4669!$mouz!$Liquid!$mouz!$0.6!$0.76!$-0.16000000000000003!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$Basically the only decent game (for betting) scheduled for today. Mouz lately are doing pretty fine, and the ChrisJ + Nex + Spiidi trio is performing really well. However we need to say that despite they are actually a real threat for T1 teams in online games, they usually struggle a bit in Lan matches, and they aren't always as consistent as they are online. On the other hand Liquid don't deserve these odds, and this is more a 60/40 game, with a decent chance to watch an upset. Obviously we're aware of all the issues Liquid faced against EU teams during the past International events, however we also need to say that they always faced top-tier teams, while now Mouz are for sure a more manageable opponent. Additionally NA teams are always a bit better when playing on the 'Mmmmurican soil. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_dust2, de_cache and de_train. If the veto goes so, Mouz should be better on Cache, while both Train and D2 will be pretty even. Current CSGL odds are too skewed in favor of Mouz, so we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Liquid, since we believe that we'll enjoy a close game.
http://csgo.guru/match/1177!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4681!$Na'Vi!$VP!$VP!$0.55!$0.65!$-0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$AVG BET!$Big match of the day, and always an extremely interesting match-up. The past match history between the two teams may trick you in believing that we're looking into a match in favor of VP, but this is not the case, and real-world odds are more aligned to 60/40 in favor of NaVi, mostly due the better form and the higher consistence in Bo3 LAN games. On the other hand VP, despite the kinda poor performances they provided in the short term, are still a quite good threat, and we're pretty sure we'll watch them taking at least a map and push the match to the third one. About maps, there are good chances to see : de_mirage, de_overpass and de_dust2. If the veto will go so, this is for sure a pretty neat set of maps, and both teams always performed pretty fine in all of them. So basically Mirage and Overpass can go both ways, while Dust2 should be in favor of NaVi (but VP lately improved a lot on it). Current CSGL odds are still around 60/40, so going with a Low bet on NaVi is still suitable, and this is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/1178!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4682!$LG!$TStorm!$TStorm!$0.6!$0.37!$0.22999999999999998!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$NA derby, and a pretty tricky match to mess with. Local games always follow a different logic compared to International ones, and in particular NA ones are always pretty messy and stuff can easily go both ways according to the better momentum. Talking about LG, their lineup is actually far superior than the Tstorm one, and even if lately they're struggling a bit (the attempt to export the EU playstyle in NA didn't work too fine yet, and basically both Pyth and DW started playing Pug-like too, instead of provide help in getting rid of the flawed NA meta) we're not oriented in calling them out so quickly. On the other hand Tstorm are doing fine, and actually they are one of the few NA teams backed by a pretty decent team chemistry and teamplay, so they aren't an easy opponent to mess with. Overall we find the current CSGL odds pretty no-sense, and this is mostly a pure 50/50 game, with LG having a solid chance to take this game, so our pick is a Low bet on Pyth and friends.
http://csgo.guru/match/1179!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4683!$Cloud9!$mouz!$mouz!$0.55!$0.75!$-0.19999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Not an usual match-up, but much likely a great match to watch. Mouz are currently doing extremely fine, and they perfectly fit in the role of Tier1 killers, according to to great amount of upsets and amazing shows they managed to achieve in the past months. On the other hand C9 are rolling pretty fine, with three 2nd places in a row, a crazy HIGH ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) form, and a pretty impressive series of top-tier performances. Right now CSGL odds are really skewed in favor of C9, mostly due the hype-train following them after the latest Lans, but honestly this is not going to be an easy match, and real-world odds are more aligned around 60/40 in their favor (C9). About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_train, de_cache and de_overpass. If the veto will go so, Train will be kinda random, while we wouldn't be surprised to see Mouz taking Cache, and Overpass will much likely go to C9. As we stated above, CSGL odds are currently too skewed for going with C9, so our pick is a Low/ICB bet on Mouz.
http://csgo.guru/match/1180!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4684!$CLG!$Liquid!$CLG!$0.6!$0.62!$-0.020000000000000018!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Just another NA derby, this time between a couple of teams that are pretty aligned. CLG yesterday did surprisingly good against C9, and despite they were playing with a stand-in, they still managed to take C9 to OT in the 2nd map, and overall they offered a solid show. Liquid faced more issues against Mouz, and they didn't understand at all the Mouz's way to play, heavily focused in countering their opponent, however for sure today will be easier for them, since this is a Local game, and both teams know each other pretty well. About maps, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a weird veto, and this kind of match-ups are usually kinda prone to upsets. There are good chances to see : de_mirage, de_train and de_cache as maps. If this happens, Mirage should be in favor of CLG, while both Cache and Train can go both ways. Current CSGL odds are around 60/40 in favor of CLG, so pretty fair, but due the composition of this match we're more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Liquid.

Honestly we're kinda happy to watch them turning into a good contender within the Tier1, and we actually believe we'll watch them improving even further in the next weeks, and overall we wouldn't be surprised to see Mouz peaking in Cologne next month. On the other hand NaVi stuttered a bit yesterday, they kinda failed in providing a consistent show against VP, despite they were favored for topping their group. However they managed to go through by beating Tstorm, in a match that honestly was really too close for a team like NaVi. About the current game, there are good chances to see NaVi bouncing back, and they'll much likely play in a way more focused way, now that we moved to Semifinals. About maps, we'll probably watch : de_dust2, de_mirage and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, NaVi should be advantaged on both Cobblestone and Mirage, while Mouz should be able to take Dust2. Current CSGL odds aren't too bad, and this is actually a 60/40 game in favor of NaVi, so our pick is a Low+ bet on NaVi.
http://csgo.guru/match/1184!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4688!$VP!$Cloud9!$VP!$0.45!$0.66!$-0.21000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Lately VP woke up a bit, and finally decided to focus and attempt to revert the not so exciting trend that characterized their latest disappointing events. On Saturday their performance against NaVi was really top-notch, and the impressive thing is that they managed to win by measure despite the veto was pretty balanced, and potentially in favor of NaVi. On the other hand C9 yesterday failed against Mouz, but this isn't as relevant as you may believe, Mouz are actually a pretty hard opponent to play against if you don't have experience with teams that have their main focus in countering and suffocating your strats, rather than trying to impose an 'active meta'. So just keep in mind that you shouldn't walk away from C9 only because they lost a single game, this is plain dumb, and their potential is still extremely high together with their form (as we observed in the following match, where they rolled over CLG without any issue). About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_dust2 and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, C9 should be able to grab Cobblestone, while both Cache and D2 can go both ways. Current CSGL odds are in favor of VP, but real-world ones are just pure 50/50, so we don't see any legit argument for not going with a Low bet on C9, in order to take advantage of the skewed CSGL odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/1185!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4693!$VP!$Na'Vi!$VP!$0.55!$0.53!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The last Semi just finished, and there isn't much time before the GrandFinal starts, so we need to keep the prediction short. So far we can say that we're kinda surprised by VP, their performance on de_inferno was pretty solid, despite they never played it in an extremely good way compared to the rest of T1 teams. On the other hand, NaVi rolled over Mouz in a pretty easy fashion, and as expected they stepped up a lot compared to yesterday. Overall we're oriented in considering this as a 55/45 match in favor of NaVi and CSGL odds are still pretty even and kinda fine for betting in both ways. About maps, NaVi are a bit better on the extended map pool (GrandFinals is played as Bo5), and the 5% edge we gave them is mostly due that, while VP lately are rotating their vetoes between 2-3 maps and this may turn into a problem (mostly after the first couple of maps). At our end we're more oriented in calling a Low bet on NaVi, but overall we're pretty sure we'll watch an extremely close game, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them playing all the 5 maps.

However, talking about the current match we need to say that C9 looked quite on point in the past weeks, and they provided a consistent challenge to most of the T1 teams, while on the other hand Kinguin are still a bit shaky and they are struggling in finding a spot within the top-tier, despite they're sporting a lineup full of talents. Current CSGL odds are a bit skewed in favor of C9, but still fine for going with a Low++ bet on them, so we'll keep believing in the American dream (internally referenced as the "Adderall dream").

On the other hand NaVi are moving here after their brilliant campaign @ ESWC, where they managed to grab the trophy after a super exciting Grand Final against C9, so you should keep an eye on them, because we'll probably watch them doing pretty fine here as well. Current CSGL odds are around 50/50, while real-world odds are 55/45 in favor of NaVi, so our pick is a Low bet on GuardiaN and friends.

TSM didn't play too much in the past weeks, they skipped ESWC and they failed pretty hard during ESL/ESEA Finals, where they went out during GroupStage after a couple of embarrassing performances. Basically the last Lan they played seriously is the first stage of FaceIT Finals, back in June, where they managed to hit the first spot, so it's safe to say that they took a little summer break right after that performance. Right now we don't really know their current form, and they're playing with their cards covered, so they're a bit of a question mark. On the other hand NiP lately are playing Bo1s better than Bo3s, and they seem more on point during GroupStages rather than Playoffs, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing fine, even if TSM are a bit their black beast, and they usually suffer their gameplay a lot, in particular if they'll end playing on de_cache. Current CSGL odds are still fine, and quite even, so we feel more confident in going Low on TSM, with the hope to watch them moving back on the right track.

Anyway, It's pretty obvious that VP are currently kinda far from their optimal form, but we need to consider that even if they're not experiencing their best days, they are for sure able to mess with Kinguin, that currently are playing in a pretty random and messy way, in particular in Bo3s. Current CSGL odds are pretty off, and not really rewarding, but at our end we believe we'll watch : de_mirage, de_overpass and de_cache as maps, and if the veto goes so, this is in clearly advantage of VP, so our pick is an Avg bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/1193!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4581!$NiP!$Liquid!$NiP!$0.75!$0.88!$-0.13!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say here, NiP shouldn't face any issue in rolling over Liquid in a Bo3, but unfortunately CSGL odds are already terrible, and as usual we don't suggest to waste time with 90/10 games, so just skip and wait for the Playoff deciders, starting as soon the last 2 teams will be determined.

However VP basically screwed the veto, and in an attempt to keep their best shots for the following match they finished playing on a terrible pattern of maps, and then packed their stuff. Anyway, talking about the current match, NaVi aren't VP, and they are currently doing pretty fine, with their whole lineup working as a well tuned orchestra, so we doubt we'll watch them failing. Just keep in mind that NaVi already faced Kinguin a couple of weeks ago in a BO3, and they lost 2-0, but that happened just because Ddos, so we are ignoring that match. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_overpass, de_mirage and de_dust2. If the veto goes so NaVi should be better on both Mirage and Overpass, while Kinguin may grab D2. Current CSGL odds are still fine for an Avg- bet on NaVi, and this is our pick.

Anyway we doubt we'll watch NiP taking more than a map, and even if Fnatic looked a bit shaky against TSM yesterday we're pretty sure they already fixed most of their issues and they already moved back on the right track. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_train, de_inferno and de_dust2. If the veto goes so, Train is always a question mark and can go both ways, while D2 could be close and Inferno will go to Fnatic. Due the pretty off CSGL odds we are more oriented in picking an ICB on NiP rather than going too high on Fnatic (even if we believe they'll take it).

TSM looked pretty fine, and they managed to hit playoffs during the first day thanks to their Bo1 victories over NiP and Fnatic. However we need to say that their match-ups against NaVi are always extremely close and even if they frequently got the upper hand, they always had to sweat blood in order to win these matches. On the other hand NaVi had a slightly rough start, and after a kinda easy entry game against VP, they failed to grab their playoff decider match against C9, so they ended playing the 'last call' game against Kinguin. Talking about the current game, there are good chances to watch : de_inferno, de_overpass and de_mirage as maps. If the veto will go so, we wouldn't be surprised to watch TSM grabbing Inferno, but both Overpass and Mirage are pure 50/50 ones (with Mirage trending a bit in favor of NaVi). Current CSGL odds for this game are pretty off, while real-world ones are just 55/45 in favor of TSM, so we're talking about a match with a serious chance to go both ways. Our pick is a Low bet on NaVi in order to take advantage of the pretty skewed odds, and overall we're pretty sure we'll watch this game hitting the 3rd map and OTs.
http://csgo.guru/match/1197!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4588!$Cloud9!$Fnatic!$Cloud9!$0.5!$0.26!$0.24!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$really interesting match-up, C9 lately are doing extremely fine, and just like TSM they managed to qualify to the Semis during the first day, by winning their Bo1s over NaVi and Kinguin. While watching them winning over Kinguin on D2 wasn't a surprise, we cannot say the same about taking Cbble from NaVi, which is arguably one of their best maps. On the other hand, we need to consider that this weekend Fnatic didn't look like the usual super-heroes rolling over everything, but instead they seemed a bit more 'humans', and their performance were kinda aligned with the ones from rest of top-teams playing the Semis. Both teams already faced each other a couple of weeks ago, during the ESL/ESEA Grand Final in Cologne, where Fnatic managed to win 3-1, but overall it was a kinda close game, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch C9 doing better with the Bo3 format (the EE Pro League Grand Final was a Bo5). About maps, in our opinion we'll watch : de_dust2, de_cbble and de_overpass. If the veto goes so, we're talking about a kinda balanced set of maps, with just the exclusion of Overpass that is a bit more in favor of Fnatic. Our pick is a Low- bet on Cloud9, mostly because we believe we'll watch a game closer than expected, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch Fnatic experiencing hard times in countering C9.

However it happened (and this is also why we love CS), and at our end we're kinda impressed by how well C9 are playing, and also quite surprised bt the CLG groupstage domination. This kind of "local" matches aren't easy to predict, since both teams are perfectly aware of how their opponents play, and it's more matter of countering them rather than imposing a play style, however we find C9 slightly more reliable, since they already showed a consistent performance with the Bo3 format, while CLG are still a bit of a question mark, and overall looks like they are relying a bit too much on Tarik + Cutler, while the C9 roster feels slightly more balanced. About maps, we'll likely watch : de_inferno, de_cache and de_train. If the veto goes so, C9 should be slightly better on the first two, while we wouldn't be surprised to watch Train going to CLG. This is basically a 60/40 game in favor of C9 and we've good feelings about them, so our pick is a Low++/Avg- bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/1214!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4429!$VP!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.45!$0.23!$0.22!$HIGH RISK!$AVG BET!$Really interesting match, and VP-Fnatic is always a quite good show to watch, in particular in the final stages of a Lan tournament. VP are usually a bit shaky during GroupStages, but this time they did really fine, maybe because LG weren't an extremely tough opponent, and C9 usually suffer the VP way to play, however they moved to Semis pretty flawlessly, and usually they are not-so-easy to face when they reach this stage. On the other hand Fnatic didn't play brightly in Groups, and despite they managed to roll-over TSM in a pretty tight game, they somehow failed to provide a consistent performance against CLG on de_mirage, despite NA teams are usually kinda shaky on this map (but looks like CLG focused a lot on it in the sort-term). Talking about maps, we'll likely watch de_inferno, de_mirage and de_cbble. If the veto goes so, VP should be able to grab Mirage, while Fnatic should be better on both Cbble and Inferno. Real-world odds are around 60/40 in favor of Fnatic, and despite we believe we'll watch a match closer than expected, we're oriented in going with a Low++/Avg- bet on Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/1215!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4438!$Cloud9!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.15!$0.25!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Honestly at our end we're pretty impressed by C9, even if their level is much likely below the Fnatic one, we need to say that they're currently playing in a pretty smart way and they're quite enjoyable to watch too. Fnatic yesterday kinda screwed the veto-session, and stuff wasn't going great after the first map, but then they stepped-up and played like aliens on both Overpass and Dust2, a couple of quite 'high risk' maps that are usually kinda prone to upsets. On the other hand C9 outplayed CLG in basically every field, and in particular they showed some real tactical smartness, since they basically forced CLG in doing the same mistakes over and over. Talking about the current match, you don't need us to figure out that Fnatic are still the clear favorite, and this is basically a 60/40 match in their favor, however the CSGL odds are really skewed, so betting high on Fnatic is pretty pointless (even if we believe they'll win) and the best thing you can do is going for an ICB on C9. If you are wondering about upset chances, we don't joke when we say that they are decent, C9 right now are filling the skill-gap with their heart, and you should beware of teams trying so hard, in particular in LAN games, because they won't go down so easily. About the maps, obviously the Bo5 format is favoring Fnatic, since they are better trained on the extended map-pool, however we're talking about a Grand Final, and as explained above, we're more oriented in taking advantage of the skewed CSGL odds and go for a YOLO ICB on Cloud9.

On the other hand CLG keeps doing little steps in the right direction, but we believe they're still quite far from T1 EU teams, even if the Bo1 will for sure help them a bit. Current CSGL odds are quite bad already, so you can either skip or go Avg on NiP, but honestly we're more for skip (there are better match for transferring skins to bots).

However Envy, according to how well they're doing, shouldn't face any major issue in beating Flipsid3, and we'll probably see a final score around 10-16 (or closer if Fsid3 will manage to force Envy on de_train).
http://csgo.guru/match/1336!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5018!$Renegades!$TSM!$TSM!$0.3!$0.09!$0.21!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Interesting match, but despite TSM lately looked a bit out of form, we don't believe they'll waste their chance to beat Renegades, and just like the rest of top-teams @ Cologne, they'll simply try to move out from the Bo1 hell as fast as possible. Renegades are comparable to an average T2 teams, and in several maps they're pretty fine, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them putting up a good fight on D2 (if picked), but overall TSM should be able to grab the match without sweating too much. Current CSGL odds aren't too good, so you can either skip or go Avg on TSM (if the odds will keep floating around 16%)

On the other hand Luminosity (ex-KeyD), are always quite fine against EU teams, and if they'll manage to force Kinguin on de_overpass or de_train there are good chances to watch an upset. Real-world odds are around 58/42 in favor of Kinguin, while CSGL ones are way more skewed, so there are the cards for attempting an ICB/Low bet on LG.

We need to note that actually this game isn't as obvious as the previous, and lately Ebettle showed crazy stuff, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them playing smartly and in a consistent way. At our end we started considering them a bit like the old G2 (but with better teamwork), and then we may try a yolo ICB on them (but nothing more).

Mouz just completed their preparation prior ESLOne and they moved here well trained and ready to mess with T1 teams, while Cloud9 are rolling strong since early Summer and they turned into a serious T1 contender, fully capable to take down most of the teams they face. Odds are currently 60/40 in favor of C9, but actually both teams share a kinda similar veto pattern, and we'll probably enjoy a quite close Bo1 and maybe an OT as well. Just like above we're more oriented in gambling with Odds and attempting a Low/ICB bet on Mouz.

Usually Titan strats aren't as reliable as the NaVi ones, and unless the shuffle changed their mind totally, they usually face quite serious issues in the late part of the game, and they have a good set of maps they don't play on an usual basis. Current CSGL odds are heavily skewed in favor of NaVi, while real-world odds are more around 60/40, so despite we believe we'll watch NaVi taking this, we're more oriented in gambling on Titan with a Low bet.

On the other hand CLG looked quite fine against NiP, and without a couple of mistakes they could have managed to hit the OT, however unless a veto-fail they should be in a better position over Ebettle, and real-world odds are around 70/30 in their favor, and CSGL ones are still fine for going for an Avg bet on them (CLG).

Mouz aren't shining, yesterday the Nex + Spiidi duo didn't play fine at all, and if this will happen today as well, may put the German side in troubles. Real-world odds are still in favor of Mouz (60/40) but this game will be mostly decided by the map, and there are some chances to see Flipsid3 coming back from hell, so overall we're a bit more oriented in playing the odds and trying our luck with an ICB on Markeloff and friends.

However we have some doubts about their overall performances in the current Major, mostly because so far they only played on Cbble, and while they need respect for beating C9, we cannot say that their entry game was an hard one. On the other hand NiP faced more troubles, their first game against CLG ended way closer than expected, and later in the day they have been steam rolled by TSM on Cache. Luckily for them, they didn't have to face any scary opponent in the Playoff decider game, and they passed over Renegades without sweating too much. Overall we can say that we have some doubts about VP because they played just a single map, and we have even more doubts about NiP since they struggled more than expected (but we need to say that they tried to go for not-relevant maps during the first day, in order to -probably- save strats). Current CSGL odds are floating around 60/40 in favor of VP, but in our opinion we're still talking about a pure 50/50 game, and we're a bit more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on NiP, in order to take advantage of the slightly better odds.

On the other hand LG had to face some really hard games, but overall we can say that they played pretty well, and they are the kind of team that adapts like a glove to the opponent they are facing; and this is usually a good thing when you reach the Playoff phase. CSGL odds are actually no-sense and totally skewed in favor of Fnatic. We're not going to argue on the Fnatic are clearly favored, this is pretty obvious, but probably LG deserve slightly more chances and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking a map. Due the terrible odds the only thing we can suggest is a ‪#‎yolo‬ ICB on LG, since there is no point in going with Fnatic for basically no reward.

We need to say that Envy look way improved compared to that game, and actually their form is quite likely around 85% of their full potential. So far they played an amazing Major, and the only match where they struggled a bit is the Bo1 against Luminosity, where LG managed to put up their AAA game and Envy started slow with their cards covered, and then had to rush in the end in order to obtain a direct ticket for Playoffs. On the other hand, TSM flexed their muscles since the beginning of the GroupStage, and they easily rolled over both Renegades and NiP (back in the GroupStage we were thinking that NiP were saving strats for Playoffs, but actually we believe they were just lacking of them), and then didn't face any issue in beating Kinguin in the Quarter Final (for sure not the hardest QF out there). A great run indeed, but against Envy they've to face a totally different opponent, and a team fully capable to counter them and reply with force. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_inferno, de_cbble and de_cache. This is a kinda shared pattern, and both teams are quite good on all of them, usually TSM are a bit better on Inferno, Cache can go both ways, while Envy should be slightly advantaged on Cobblestone. Current CSGL odds are floating around 60/40 in favor of Envy, and we kinda agree, the form of the French team is probably a bit higher compared to TSM, and they already showed that they know how to counter the Danish side, so our pick is a Low bet on Envy.
http://csgo.guru/match/1447!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5066!$VP!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.45!$0.22!$0.23!$HIGH RISK!$AVG BET!$2nd Semi and a pretty interesting match-up we already enjoyed during the ESL/ESEA Grand-Final in July, back in early summer nobody was expecting to see VP doing so good, since they were on a pretty inconsistent streak, and they were struggling in online games since a while; but well, VP are kinda used to surprise, so you should be always very careful in marking them dead too early. On the other hand, Fnatic are currently on an incredible run, they stomped every single opponent they faced, with Tennis-like scores, and actually they're the team with the highest chances to hit the Final. During EE Grand-Final they showed that they perfectly know how to deal with the VP way to play, and for sure their team composition put them in a better position in most of the maps compared to the setting used by the Polish side (5+1, without a comparable AWPer). About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_inferno, de_train and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, Fnatic are clearly advantaged on Inferno, and slightly on Cobblestone, while Train may go to VP. Current CSGL odds are widely skewed in favor of Fnatic (real-world odds are 60/40 for Fnatic), and currently percentages are still rising in their favor, so we suggest to wait a bit before placing your bet. If the odds will stay around 25/75 you can attempt an Average bet on Fnatic, since they're clearly favored, but if the percentages will drop even further and hit the 20% threshold, the best pick is an ICB on VP, since there is no-point in risking an High bet on Semi of a Major, which is featuring two teams that so far did really fine.

Actually CSGL odds for this Bo3 aren't anything exceptional, and TSM are for sure advantaged, however, we need to remember that Kinguin are currently pretty random, and they may grab a map and provide more fight than expected. About maps, there are good chances to watch de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, D2 should go to TSM, while both Overpass and Train can easily go both way. CSGL odds are currently pretty off, so the best idea is going for an ICB on Kinguin and keep your fingers crossed.

NaVi didn't impress too much during ESL One Cologne, while we were expecting them peaking, instead they provided a couple of kinda disappointing performances (16-2 vs Fnatic &amp; 2-0 vs EnvyUs). On the other hand, VP had a way better run, and they managed to hit Semi-Finals, where they put up a pretty good fight against Fnatic, showing really good things before failing on Cbble. Talking about the current game, there are good chances to watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train as maps. If the veto will go so, VP should be advanataged on Train, while both D2 and Overpass can easily go both ways. Overall VP are probably a tiny bit advantaged, but honestly not as much as displayed on CSGL, and most of their games against NaVi ended with pretty tight scores, additionally the Polish side is a bit more inconsistent in Online games, compared to their quite good Lan performances. At our end we're a bit more oriented in playing the Odds, so we'll go for a Low bet on NaVi, in order to take advantage of the pretty sweet 30/70 percentages.

Mouz are just back from their not-so-exciting run at ESL One Cologne, and technically their form should be pretty decent, however we fear that their mind is not actually here, hopefully NiKo will be able to bring some freshness (he'll sub for ChrisJ). On the other hand, D&amp;G are basically the lineup that is born from the ashes of Gamers2, with just the addition of Loord, a quite promising pick, mostly because the huge experience boost he can provide. For this game they'll play with Morelz, subbing for MINISE, according to our Polish boyz not the best pick out there. Current CSGL odds are pretty skewed in favor of Mouz, but honestly we believe they'll be able to grab this Bo3, and D&amp;G, just like the old G2 lineup, never played matches featuring an extended map-pool in a consistent way. Our pick is an Avg bet on Mouz

Actually the current situation seems a bit more stable, so it's time to provide again some love to NA games. Talking about the current match, both teams never shone on the International soil, but locally they are pretty fine, since most of the NA teams share the same meta, with just C9 (and partially, ex-LG) standing out from the bunch. Usually CLG are a bit more consistent than Liquid, in particular on the extended map-pool, however we need to note that Hiko is currently standing-in (he's on a trial) for Liquid, and this may help a bit, even if his form isn't extremely high (61/100 according to our Ranking) or comparable to the first Quarter of the year. About maps, as displayed in our Veto Pattern graph, de_dust2, de_overpass, de_mirage and de_train are all pretty popular picks, and there are good chances to watch all of them if the match will last more than a Bo3. If it goes so, D2 and Mirage (here the edge is pretty low) should be in favor of CLG, while Overpass and Train are usually pretty random and can easily go both ways. Anyway, the default 1-0 is a pretty big advantage, and we doubt we'll watch CLG wasting it, or losing two Bo3s in a row, so, even if CSGL odds are currently pretty bad, we're oriented in picking an Avg bet on CLG.

This is a Loser Bracket match, and Kinguin aren't exactly a super-scary opponent, mostly due their quite high inconsistency and randomness on the extended map-pool, even if we need to remember that they already managed to deliver a pretty huge upset against VP back in July (something nobody was expecting, in particular the 16-0 on de_cache, a map where VP used to be pretty fine), however according to what they displayed yesterday against TSM, we doubt we'll watch this happening again. About maps, according to our Veto Patter tab (you can find it below this prediction), there are pretty good chances to watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, VP should be advantaged on Overpass and Train, while Dust2 can easily go both ways and we wouldn't be surprised to watch Kinguin taking it. Current CSGL Odds are pretty skewed and they're still moving a little, so we suggest to wait a bit before placing you bet (45mins before a match is usually a safe threshold), if the Kinguin odds will drop below 20% you can try an ICB on them, but if they'll stay above 20% you can go for an Avg bet on VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/1505!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5127!$Na'Vi!$TSM!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.32!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Big match of the day, both TSM and NaVi are sporting a pretty high placement in our World Ranking (already updated with ESL One Cologne data) and yesterday NaVi displayed a pretty top-tier performance against VP, clearing some of the fog that was sitting over them due their not so exciting show in Cologne. Talking about the current match, TSM are for sure slightly advantaged, and their form should be noticeably higher as well (67.78 vs 66.17, which is a decent margin within the Tier1), additionally both teams usually share a pretty similar Veto Pattern, and this make the Form factor an even more relevant value. About maps, according to our Veto tab you can find below, there are good chances to watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, Dust2 should be in advantage of TSM, while Overpass and Train can easily go both ways (there is just a marginal edge in favor of TSM on Train). Since we're talking about a Tier1 game, and current CSGL odds are really skewed, we're more oriented in attempting a Low bet on NaVi.
http://csgo.guru/match/1506!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5122!$SK!$Kinguin!$SK!$0.3!$0.31!$-0.010000000000000009!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Quite nice low-tier match, in the past SK (Tier3, Form: 50.61) already managed to deliver several upset to higher Tier teams, and in particular today that Kinguin (Tier2, Form: 64.74) is playing with a couple of stand-ins (F0rest, Form: 71.5 and Legija, Form: 53.2) we wouldn't be surprised to watch a match a bit closer than expected. Anyway we need to note that GameAgents League is using the infamous Bo2 format, and this means that there are extremely high chances to watch a Tie and then skins returned. According to our stats, we believe we'll watch de_mirage and de_overpass as maps, if the veto-session will go so, Kinguin should be advantaged on Mirage, while SK may put up a pretty good fight on Overpass. Current CSGL odds turned a bit better due the temporary lineup changes in Kinguin, but honestly we still believe that we're talking about a 70/30 game in their favor, and a couple of stand-ins shouldn't impact too much on a team that plays like a mix on daily basis. Our pick is a Low/Avg bet on Kinguin, and in the worst case we'll probably watch a Tie.
http://csgo.guru/match/1513!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5146!$VP!$TSM!$VP!$0.5!$0.52!$-0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Basically the only really interesting match scheduled, and the only one we're going to cover today, since the rest of the games are below Tier 3, or part of the Qualifiers for the World Championship (we won't cover it till Playoff, most of the current matches are pretty weird and don't follow any pattern). Talking about the teams, yesterday VP managed to roll over Kinguin in a pretty easy fashion, while TSM experienced hard times with NaVi, failing pretty hard in both Dust2 and Overpass, despite a pretty promising start on Mirage (a map where NaVi are usually on-point). The current match will be played as Bo5, so the Veto-session is not relevant as it is in Bo3 games, and then we need to read our Veto Pattern graph in a bit different way, basically looking for the side with the straightest line, this will show how much a team is consistent on the extended map pool. Another important factor is the Form, and according to our World Ranking, TSM (despite their disappointing performance vs NaVi) are actually sporting a pretty high short-term score (67.78), while VP are floating considerably lower (61.9, and this value is so mostly due Pasha being quite inconsistent in the last Quarter, not on par with the rest of his team). According to this, we believe we'll watch TSM doing better on the classic maps, while VP will likely perform better on the new ones; with de_cbble and de_dust2 very likely vetoed off. Current CSGL odds are slightly skewed in favor of VP, but we're talking about a pure 50/50 Tier1 game, so at our end we're oriented in playing a bit with these percentages, and our pick is a Low bet on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/1517!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5159!$Na'Vi!$VP!$VP!$0.58!$0.65!$-0.07000000000000006!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This is the Group A Final, the winner of this game will directly move to the LAN Finals taking place in early October in Bucharest, Romania; while the loser, together with the 3rd and 4th placed teams, will get their shot at redemption in the Last Chance group, where they will fight for the last playoff slot available. NaVi will move to this match with an automatic 1-0 advantage, since they're from the Upper Bracket, on the other hand VP had to roll through the LB, where yesterday managed to beat TSM in a really tight Bo5. For sure the default 1-0 is a pretty relevant starting point in a Bo5 match, and if NaVi will manage to grab the first map, they'll have 3 match points for closing the game, so the winning chances are obviously in their favor. Additionally, a couple of days ago NaVi already rolled over VP in their entry game in Group A, so this is not going to be an easy match for VP, even if yesterday they displayed really good things against TSM, and looks like they woke up a bit from their post-Major drowsiness. Talking about maps, both teams share a quite similar Veto Pattern (as you can see in the graph below), and in our opinion there are good chances to watch : de_mirage, de_inferno, de_overpass and de_train. If we nailed it, Inferno and Overpass should be in favor of NaVi, while Train will likely go to VP and Mirage is mostly a 50/50 one. Current CSGL odds are pretty skewed in favor of NaVi, but this is pretty obvious due the default advantage and the similar veto, so real-world odds should be around 60-40 in their favor as well. At our end, we're oriented in picking a Low++ Bet on NaVi, however we need to note that if we'll watch Mirage and Train as first maps, we might watch a match way closer than expected, and NaVi may face really hard times in coming back from a 2-1 situation in favor of VP.

Talking about the current match, the 99DMG Arena is mostly a warming up cup, so we don't expect amazing performances and overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch teams playing quite below their full potential. However, usually the Bo3 format is a bit more in favor of HR, since they're slightly more solid on the extended map-pool, while Efrag most of the times need a more specific veto in order to provide a solid show in Bo3 games. Actually we didn't add the APM data to the site yet, so our Veto Pattern graph is missing several key Head2Head matches that are important in order to analyze this match-up, anyway by crossing the Veto-Lines of both teams you can easily figure out which maps are shared; so there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_overpass and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, Overpass is in favor of HR, while Inferno and Cache can easily go both ways. Current CSGL odds are trending in favor of HR, but at our end we're more oriented in attempting a Low bet on EFrag mostly because the more rewarding percentages, since we're not talking about a super-relevant match and both teams aren't really in form yet.
http://csgo.guru/match/1521!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5188!$Fnatic!$mouz!$Fnatic!$0.7!$0.88!$-0.18000000000000005!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$Not much to say about this game since CSGL odds already turned into trash and we never suggest to bet on 90/10 games due the extremely low reward, additionally Mouz are playing with S1mple (Form: 67.5) instead of ChrisJ (Form: 64.4) and NiKo (Form: 59.7) instead of Spiidi (Form: 62.5). Technically not an huge difference since both players fit pretty well the role of the player they're subbing, but overall we doubt we'll watch the complex teamplay required for beating a team like Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08). About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, we'll likely watch de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, we wouldn't be surprised to watch Mouz taking Dust2, since it's a map where playing as mix isn't too relevant, while Fnatic will likely take both Overpass and Train. As we stated above, the CSGL odds are too skewed for betting on Fnatic, so you can either skip or attempt a #yolo ICB on Mouz (if you've some spare cents to waste).
http://csgo.guru/match/1522!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5176!$Titan!$Dignitas!$Dignitas!$0.5!$0.45!$0.04999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Big match of the day, Dignitas are currently floating in the high-Tier2 (Ranked 11th, Form: 59.7) and they're one of the candidates for a Tier1 spot (together with HR and Mouz), while Titan are just back from their extremely disappointing campaign at ESL One Cologne, where after a promising show against NaVi they've been kicked out from the Group-Stage by Renegades (something no-one was really expecting). Additionally Titan are also the only top-end team that didn't perform in line with the rest of their Tier (Ranked 8th, Form: 62.26), so they're risking demotion in our next iteration of the World Ranking. Talking about the current match-up, CSGL odds are actually trending in favor of Dignitas, this is happening because a great part of the previous H2Hs against Titan finished in their favor, however we need to note that Titan added Shox and Smithzz during the French Shuffle in early Summer, so we don't suggest to take old data as pure gold. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch de_cache, de_cbble and de_mirage. If the veto will go so, Mirage will very likely end in favor of Dignitas, while Titan should be able to take Cobblestone, and Cache is mostly 50/50. Overall we're considering this match as a quite even one, and then we're oriented in picking a Low bet on Titan mostly because the more rewarding odds (and also because we consider most of the previous H2Hs as not really relevant).
http://csgo.guru/match/1525!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5183!$Dignitas!$CW!$Dignitas!$0.6!$0.69!$-0.08999999999999997!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This is one of the very first games for the new CPH Wolves lineup, the new roster formed in mid-August and only played the DH London Qualifier and a bunch of CEVO matches, so we don't really have any real H2H data yet. Actually, we're pretty surprised by their show against EFrag (3-2), and looks like they have potential, for sure the NO-SWE mix is an interesting choice and not the usual soup we're used to watch. On the other hand, Dignitas are actually doing pretty fine in CEVO, and they're on a quite positive 2-0 streak, additionally they're back from holidays since a while, so we doubt we'll watch them dropping more than a map against CPH Wolves, and in the worst case we'll probably watch a Tie and skins returned. Obviously Dignitas will take this game mostly as a warm-up for the following one against Titan, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them testing stuff, anyway we're confident in picking an Average bet on them, since we doubt we'll watch them choking both maps.
http://csgo.guru/match/1528!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5189!$LG!$CLG!$null!$0.6!$0.71!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is for sure one of the best match-ups we can enjoy within the NA scene, both teams are currently sitting in Tier2 and they are sharing a pretty similar form (Luminosity: 57.32 &amp; CLG: 57.29), so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a couple pretty even maps (and maybe a Tie). Talking about LG, they didn't play too much in the past week, however they managed to hit Playoffs during ESL One Cologne 2 weekends ago, and we need to say that they displayed pretty good things overall (OT vs Envy, 16-14 vs Fnatic, and a couple of victories over F3 and Kinguin), additionally they are usually pretty fine in countering NA teams, in particular they already rolled over CLG plenty of times in the past (but most of this data is older than 4 months, so not really relevant), and this is why the CSGL odds are so skewed in their favor. On the other hand CLG experienced some bad-luck during the last Major, but honestly they didn't do too bad too (they lost 13-16 vs NiP &amp; 14-16 vs NaVi), and they're definitely doing steps in the right direction. Talking about the current match, according to our Veto Graph, both teams share a kinda similar pattern, with the only relevant exception of Dust2, which is one of the maps where we usually watch CLG performing really well. Since we're talking about a Bo2, we'll likely watch the veto-session ending with an in-between, so something similar to de_overpass + de_mirage (or de_train). If it goes so, Mirage is mostly 50/50, while Overpass is a bit in favor of LG (if we'll watch Train instead of Mirage, CLG should be favored). Current CSGL odds are heavily skewed in favor of Luminosity, while real-world odds aren't really so since both teams kinda share a similar form. Our pick is a Low bet on CLG in order to take advantage of the skewed percentages (but just keep in mind that the Tie chances are pretty high).
http://csgo.guru/match/1529!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5207!$mouz!$Titan!$mouz!$0.5!$0.68!$-0.18000000000000005!$LOW RISK!$LOW BET!$Just like Titan vs Dignitas that took place yesterday, this match is extremely relevant in order to consolidate the Titan's position within the World Ranking. Mouz, are actually sharing their boat with Dignitas, and they're both good candidates for a Tier1 spot, while Titan are in whirl of disappointing and pretty inconsistent results since a quite long time. Honestly we're kinda surprised to watch how marginally Shox and Smithzz are impacting on the gameplay, despite they're supposed to be quite in form (respectively 76/100 and 58.8/100), looks like that most of the hard work is currently provided by Rpk and Maniac, something a bit unusual. About Mouz, they're actually messing with Stand-Ins, so providing a proper evaluation on their performances isn't really easy, yesterday they managed to grab a map from Fnatic, and today they'll still deploy a roster without ChrisJ (NiKo will play instead) so we're not sure about what they'll manage to setup. Talking about the current Bo3, according to our Veto Pattern graph there are good chances to watch : de_cbble, de_mirage and de_train as maps. If it goes so, we'll enjoy the 'clone' of the yesterday's veto, and will be for sure interesting. In this case, there are good chances to watch Mouz taking Mirage, while both Train and Cobblestone (here Titan should be slightly advantaged, yesterday they tilted in the late game but their T side was solid) can go both ways. Current CSGL odds are pretty skewed and quite no-sense, this is mostly a 50/50 match and there are pretty high chances to watch the 3rd map kicking-in, so our pick is a Low bet on Titan in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

However, Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) are clearly advantaged, and despite Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.7) managed to show good things, there are pretty good chances to watch a plain 2-0. About maps, we'll likely watch : de_overpass, de_train and de_mirage, if the veto will go so Fnatic should be advantaged on both Mirage and Train, while Overpass could be a tiny bit more balanced. As stated above, the CSGL odds are terrible, so you can either skip or go for a #yolo ICB on Dignitas (if you've some spare cents to waste).

On the other hand we already widely discussed about Titan and their issues in the previous game (Mouz - Titan). Talking about the current match, there are pretty high chances to watch de_mirage and de_overpass as maps, and if the veto goes so we'll likely enjoy a really tight match. HR are usually pretty fine on Mirage, but yesterday Titan looked quite on-point too, while Overpass is mostly 50/50 and a bit random. Current CSGL odds are skewed in favor of Titan, and we kinda agree on it. Given that both teams played in a pretty inconsistent way in the short-term, we need to say that overall Titan looked a bit more organized, while yesterday HR played against Efrag without any plan in place, and with even worse on-the-fly adjustments. At our end we're a bit more oriented in going for a Low++ bet on Titan, but keep in mind that this is an extremely risky match, and there are also quite high chances to watch just a Tie.
http://csgo.guru/match/1534!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5213!$CLG!$coL!$null!$0.7!$0.85!$-0.15000000000000002!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$For sure a quite fresh match-up, this is one of the very first match of the new CompLexity lineup, and as usual for coL, it's sporting several promising elements and a pretty interesting mix between former Tempo-Storm players and the hard-workers of the old Maximum-Effort mix (overall we can say that this teams is mostly a fruit of the summer-long shuffle). So far the new roster didn't play more than a couple of games (previous Maximum-Effort matches were played with Hiko &amp; Desi, so no longer relevant), and they're still in an early phase, so we need a couple of weeks in order to properly evaluate their potential. However, according to what we watched in their game against Liquid we believe that they will likely float around the 4rd-5th place in the NA scene. Talking about the current game, guessing the maps is basically impossible since coL didn't play enough, but overall CLG (Ranked 7th in Tier2, Form: 57.29) should be better and more experienced on a wide part of the map-pool, so we really doubt we'll watch them losing more than a map, and there are good chances for watching a plain 2-0 victory. CSGL odds are already quite off, and still dropping quickly, but if they'll stay around 82/18 or so, you can attempt an Avg++ bet on CLG, which should guarantee an acceptable profit together with a not so high risk.
http://csgo.guru/match/1536!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5245!$Dignitas!$mouz!$mouz!$0.5!$0.42!$0.08000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Without any doubt the match of the day, Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) and Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.9) are currently experiencing a pretty good trend, and in the past couple of days they both managed to beat Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) with the same score (2-1), and they look quite consistent on the extended map-pool, so we're sure that this Bo5 will be a blast and a quite amazing game to watch. Since we're talking about a Bo5, there isn't much to guess about the veto-session, and we're kinda sure we'll see de_inferno and de_dust2 vetoed off. However our Veto Pattern graph is still interesting because it shows the consistency of the teams and their trend in picking maps, and usually the straightest line shows the most solid team of the two. Talking about the win/loss distribution, we believe we'll watch Mouz taking Mirage, while Dignitas should be able to grab Overpass, and the rest of the maps (de_train, de_cbble and de_cache) are mostly pure 50/50 ones that can easily go both ways. CSGL odds are trending in favor of Mouz, and according to our data they actually have a marginal edge, but overall not enough for justifying the 60/40 in their favor currently displayed on Lounge. If the CSGL odds will stay so, we're oriented in gambling with them and trying our luck with a Low bet on Dignitas, but keep in mind that this is a quite risky pick, so you shouldn't be surprised to watch Mouz taking the game.

Anyway, on the other hand stuff isn't going any better, and Ebettle (Tier3, Form: 56.0) collected a couple of quite weird losses too, additionally we cannot say that they played too much in the short-term, so actually they're a bit of a question mark. Talking about the current game, honestly we doubt we'll watch Kinguin losing twice in a row (again), and they really need at least a Tie in order to stop their series of bad results and re-acquire some self-confidence, overall we can say that there are good chances to watch this happening, so we're oriented in picking an Average bet on them, and the CSGL odds are still fine (around 20/80) for betting in this way (but you might attempt an ICB on Ebettle if they drop top 15/85).
http://csgo.guru/match/1540!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5234!$D&G!$Titan!$null!$0.45!$0.18!$0.27!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Here Titan might have their chances to redeem themselves from the several really disappointing results achieved in the past weeks, yesterday against HR they already managed to bounce back after just another last-half choke against Mouz, so overall we can say that their issues are quite mitigated by the Bo2 format, and they're doing generally better in CEVO compared to Bo3s games. On the other hand D&amp;G (Tier3, Form: 53.9) are still quite random and not really consistent, they keep alternating God-Like days with horrible ones, and they're kinda unpredictable, however what we can for sure affirm is that they are usually relevant on just a quite limited amount of maps, and if Titan will handle the veto smartly there are good chances for watching a plain 2-0 in favor of the French side. Unfortunately (and luckily for the Polish fans) Titan aren't famous for their good veto sessions, so we'll likely watch : de_mirage and de_overpass as maps, and if the veto goes so we'll likely watch a pretty tight and balanced match. Current CSGL odds are overly skewed in favor of Titan, so we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB on D&amp;G.

Overall there isn't much data available for King Hunden and friends, and so far they mostly played against quite low teams, with the only exceptions of Property (that within our World Ranking are frozen, due their unstable roster) and E-Frag (the Bulgarian side won by measure), and honestly we kinda doubt we'll watch them doing fine in more than a map. About HR, currently they're a bit in a slump compared to the rest of the top-ranked Tier2 teams (Mouz &amp; Dig), and lately they looked quite lost strats-wise, but they're still fully capable to mess with Reason and they have good chances to take this game with a plain 2-0. Current CSGL odds are still decent for an Average bet on HR, so this is our pick, and overall in the worst case we should watch a Tie.

Sponsorless (Tier3, Form: 56.8), similar to coL, are mostly a mix of former Tempo-Storm players, together with leftovers from the summer shuffle that hit the North American scene pretty hard during the past Quarter. So far Sponsorless has played a few more times than most of the other mixes around, and gameplay-wise, they are slightly more solid and organized. Additionally, it looks as though they mastered the 'art' of stalemates in CEVO matches. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch them work their magic against Liquid as well earning yet another another tie. On the other hand, Liquid (Ranked 10th in Tier2, Form: 58.5) are playing again with Hiko, and considering their exceptional play as of late, they're naturally favored to take this match. Current CSGL odds aren't that appealing, and although the Bo2 format isn't very consistent, we doubt we'll watch Liquid lose twice (worst case, we'll likely just watch a Tie). So we're oriented towards picking an Avg bet on them.

Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) are obviously favored, not just because they're currently the best team in the World, but also because they'll move here with a default 1-0 in their favor due coming from the Upper Bracket, so basically there are pretty few chances to watch them failing their qualification to Playoffs, in particular in a Bo5 match. On the other hand, yesterday Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) did pretty fine against Dignitas, and looks like that the switch between Spiidi (Ranked 47th as Rifler, Form: 62.5) and NiKo (Ranked 3rd as All-Rounder, Form: 69.7) is paying off, according to the monster stats that the Bosnian talent managed to display versus the Danish side (he finished with a pretty impressive 113/54 kd). Despite we're talking about a quite interesting match, the CSGL odds are basically trash, and betting here is mostly a waste of time since the percentages are currently floating around 93/7 in favor of Fnatic (== no reward for betting on them), so you can either skip or try a #yolo ICB on Mouz (but Fnatic will very very very likely take the match with a final score around 3-1).

About HR, yesterday they were about to lose against Reason, but luckily for them AdreN &amp; ANGE1 stepped up and managed to save a match that was edging a stinging defeat, however the 2-1 final score doesn't delete the fact that they played in a terrible way the first 2 maps of the Bo3. On the other hand, SK after a couple of weeks where they were pretty in Form and capable to mess with Tier2 teams, fell again into mediocrity, and yesterday they somehow managed to lose a Bo2 against Property, and actually Property are just a mix, switching their lineup on a daily basis and playing without any real strat or logic (this is why they're currently 'frozen' in our World Ranking). Talking about the current game, according to our Veto Pattern graph there are good chances to watch : de_overpass, de_cbble and de_inferno as maps. If the veto-session will go so, HR should be advantaged on Cbble and Inferno, while SK should be slightly better on Overpass. Honestly this is a pretty random match, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch scores way closer than expected (and plenty of mistakes from both sides), overall we're a bit more oriented in going with HellRaiser, but due the high-risk we suggest to stay Low in value.
http://csgo.guru/match/1569!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5264!$E-Frag!$Kinguin!$Kinguin!$0.45!$0.48!$-0.02999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Really interesting Tier2 game, and actually a pretty even one, both teams already faced a couple of times, and despite Kinguin manged to win in all the occasions, the score difference was basically irrelevant and the matches were mostly decided by personal plays rather than a structured strategy. Talking about teams, Efrag (Ranked 6th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) are on a quite hot winning streak, but we need to note that lately they mostly faced Tier3 teams (or below) so most of these results should be ignored and considered just in function of the 'confidence boost' that they may provide, so actually the only really interesting result is their 2-0 victory against HR, where they for sure managed to put up a pretty great show. On the other hand Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7), aren't facing their brightest moment, and in the past week they've been hit in the face by basically every T1-T3 team in the scene, failing to grab a victory even against teams such as eBettle and SK, which should be manageable opponents for a masterclass lineup such as the one that Kinguin is sporting. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, EFrag should be able to grab Overpass, while Kinguin should be a bit better on D2 and Train is mostly a pure 50/50 map. Current CSGL odds are trending in favor of Kinguin, but honestly EFrag looked a bit more solid in Bo3 games, and their strats follow an easy but logical pattern, opposed to the mess that Kinguin are used to setup, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on the Bulgarian side.
http://csgo.guru/match/1570!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5266!$Dignitas!$Titan!$Titan!$0.5!$0.32!$0.18!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Here we are again! Say welcome to just another episode of the endless battle between Titan and Dignitas, where Titan are (desperately) trying to keep their Tier1 spot, while Dignitas, (together with Mouz) are assaulting it relentlessly on a daily basis. This is a CEVO match, so we're talking about a Bo2, currently Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) are facing pretty hard days, their consistence in Bo3 matches is pretty questionable and they keep losing focus during the final part of the matches, the crucial moment when we talk about 50/50 match-ups. However, today we're talking about a Bo2, and this is a format that for sure will help a bit the French side, while Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.5) are usually a bit vulnerable when they're forced to play in maps they don't like (as we observed in their latest game against Mouz, where the veto didn't exactly go as they were hoping). About maps, there are quite huge chances to watch : de:_mirage and de_mirage and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, Mirage lately is trending in favor of Titan, while Cbble is mostly 50/50. Current CSGL odds are slightly favoring Titan, and honestly we doubt we'll watch them losing both maps, so we agree with the trend and we pick a Low+ bet on them as well.
http://csgo.guru/match/1571!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5267!$TSM!$Na'Vi!$TSM!$0.45!$0.63!$-0.18!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$CounterPit Lower Bracket final and one of the two Big Matches scheduled for today! As you may have guessed already, this is mostly a pure 50/50 games, both teams are floating around the same level since a while and they're also sharing a quite similar Form (NaVi: 66.1 &amp; TSM: 67.7), so despite the CSGL odds, we're talking about a game that can easily go both ways. NaVi in the past few days faced a slightly drop in the quality of their Gameplay, and overall they looked quite lost in countering VirtusPro in the PGL Group A Final, despite they were sporting a quite heavy 1-0 default advantage, and they were coming from a victory against TSM just few hours before. On the other hand TSM in the short-term managed to lose against most of the other top-6 teams, showing a quite relevant lack of on-the-fly counter-stratting and an heavy inconsistency on the extended map-pool. Talking about maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph you can find below, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_mirage. If it will go so, both D2 and Mirage are pure 50/50, while Overpass should be in (slightly) favor of NaVi. Current CSGL odds are quite skewed in favor of TSM, but as we stated above this is not correct, and real-world odds are simply in the middle, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on NaVi, in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

This is for sure the most interesting match of the day, VirtusPro (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) lately stepped up a lot, and what they managed to achieve in the Bo5 against NaVi (they won 3-1, despite the NaVi deafult 1-0 advantage) is simply amazing and for sure something that nobody was really expecting, but as you know if you're following the Polish side since a while, they always put up their AAA game when the 'on-the-paper odds' aren't in their favor. On the other hand, the refreshed EnvyUs (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8) lineup is a pretty scary opponent, and they're one of the few teams that have the capability to dethrone Fnatic from their Top1 spot. So far they did pretty great, and their potential is still really high, however they took some days off right after ESL One Cologne, and this is basically the first game they'll play since mid-late August, so we cannot guess if they will be able to keep their level high enough despite the break. Talking about maps, according to our beloved Veto Pattern graph, there are quite good chances to watch : de_inferno, de_dust2 and de_train. If it will go so, Envy should be better on Inferno and D2 (but here VP improved a lot), while Train is in favor of VirtusPro. Current CSGL odds are really skewed in favor of EnvyUs, mostly because their performance @ Cologne, while honestly and according to what VP displayed in the short term (+ the fact that Envy took a little break) we're talking about real-world odds that are around just 55/45 in favor of the French side, so there are quite decent chances to watch an upset, and we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on VP (odds are way more rewarding).

As we stated several times already in the other Kinguin match scheduled for today, the EU mix isn't floating in calm waters, and they're currently on a quite bad streak, however we're talking about a Bo2 match, and overall with some effort they could be able to grab a Tie and put up a good fight overall. Dignitas are for sure a bit more solid strat-wise compared to Kinguin, but they might face issues if the Penguins will play the veto smartly by moving the match on a couple of momentum-based maps. About maps, we'll likely watch de_mirage and de_dust2. If the veto goes so, Mirage may go to Dignitas, while Dust2 should be in favor of Kinguin. CSGL odds are heavily floating, and overall we're a bit more oriented in suggesting a Low bet on Kinguin, but honestly this game will probably end in a plain Tie.

These games, unlike the GroupStage matches we enjoyed so far, will use the Bo1 format, so they may lead to upsets and nothing is written in stone. Talking about the match it self, yesterday NaVi didn't manage to put up a great fight against TSM, and they lost de_overpass in a quite dumb way, by choking the easiest side. On the other hand yesterday Dignitas had to deal with a stand-in (Maziaz instead of Nico) and overall they played quite bad in their CEVO game against Titan, and even worse versus Mouz a day before. Obviously nailing the correct map is way harder due the Bo1 format, in this case we believe we'll watch de_mirage, and if it goes so NaVi should be advantaged (but they MUST fix their CT side). Current CSGL odds aren't exceptional, and currently floating around 80/20 in favor of NaVi, but honestly they're advantaged and we believe they'll move forward in facing Kinguin in the next match that will be played later today, so our pick is an Avg bet on them.

Yesterday Mouz faced Fnatic in the Group B final, but Fnatic were from the Upper Bracket and they jumped in with a 1-0 default advantage, a quite huge additional plus for a team that is already the top1 of the World Ranking. However Mouz didn't play too bad and they managed to grab a map. On the other hand TSM rolled over NaVi in a quite convincingly way, and obviously they're the favored team. About the map, there are good chances to watch de_dust2, and if the veto will go so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a game closer than expected. Current CSGL odds are in favor of TSM, but real-world percentages are a bit more aligned to the middle, and at our end we are a bit more oriented in going for a Low bet on Mouz.

Enemy and coL are quite new lineups, born from the summer shuffle, with diametrically opposed way to play the game, additionally they both sport several quite promising youngsters, so there are good chances to watch an interesting and fast-paced match and maybe a final result a bit closer than expected. CompLexity are currently doing pretty fine, they already showed that they can mess with both Liquid and CLG, so they're obviously favored for taking this match, on the other hand Enemy aren't too bad but looks like they've serious issues in closing the games despite the promising starts. Current CSGL odds are pretty bad and barely rewarding, so you can either skip or (if you really wish to bet) go for an Avg+ bet on coL (we doubt we'll watch them losing twice, and in the worst case we'll probably watch a Tie).

Fsid3 (Ranked 5th in Tier2, Form: 56.6) didn't play a lot during the last week, but one of their latest games was in late-august and against Kinguin, in this match they managed to put up a superb show and they ended with a 2-0 victory. On the other hand, Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) aren't usually too consistent on the extended-map pool, however they'll move here well warmed-up by their PGL game against Dignitas, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them landing their shots. Talking about maps, these teams feature a quite different Veto Pattern (as you can figure out by looking at our graph below), and then there are good chances for watching a close game and even an upset. In our opinion, we'll watch : de_cache, de_mirage and de_train. If it goes so, Kinguin should be a tiny bit advantaged on Mirage, while the rest of the maps can easily go both ways. Current CSGL odds are way skewed in favor of Kinguin, but we don't suggest to under-estimate Flipsid3 since they already displayed that they're capable to mess (pretty well) with Scream &amp; friends, so our pick is a Low bet on Fsid3.
http://csgo.guru/match/1595!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5289!$Na'Vi!$HR!$HR!$0.7!$0.88!$-0.18000000000000005!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Just like Fsid3 - Kinguin reviewed an hour ago, the winner of this game will qualify to the FaceIT League S3, but unlike the previous game the CSGL odds already turned into trash. However we're talking about a quite interesting CIS derby, and usually this kind of local games are always a bit more close than expected, so even if NaVi are clearly favored (but keep in mind that they're moving to this game after several matches played in a row, so their form will be a bit lower compared to the 'middle' games) there are good chances to watch HR taking a map. About the veto-session, according to our graph, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_inferno and de_overpass as maps. If it goes so, Dust2 can go easily both ways, while NaVi should be advantaged on both Inferno and Overpass. Current CSGL odds are trash, and betting on NaVi isn't rewarding at all, so you can either skip or attempt an ICB on HR.
http://csgo.guru/match/1596!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5280!$Dignitas!$Kinguin!$Kinguin!$0.5!$0.3!$0.2!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the first Lower Bracket match of the PGL 'Last Chance' qualifier, and just like the rest of the PGL games scheduled for today it will be played as Bo1. Early today Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.5) faced NaVi, and as expected they didn't impress and failed to setup a proper challenge, additionally we cannot say they went for a smart veto, since de_overpass is a map in clearly favor of NaVi, and picking it was basically a suicide. On the other hand Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) yesterday managed to clean their image a little, by beating E-Frag and setting up a pretty entertaining game, so we're sure they're moving to this match pretty pumped up. About the map, as usual nailing the correct veto in Bo1 games is extremely hard, but we believe there are good chances to watch de_mirage or de_train; if it goes so Kinguin should be slightly bit advantaged on Mirage, while Dignitas should be a bit better on Train. Overall we're talking about a quite even game, and mostly a 50/50 one, so current CSGL odds are quite off and overly skewed (mostly due the huge amount of fans rooting for Kinguin), at our end we're oriented in picking a Low bet on Dignitas in order to take advantage of the higher reward.

Again the format will be the Bo1, and then we're not going to watch a solid match and instead an heavily map-based one, both teams are coming here well warmed-up from by the previous games they played today (Titan easily rolled over Infinity in CEVO, while Mouz lost by measure against TSM), additionally these rosters already faced each other multiple times in the short-term, and we always watched pretty close games and Bo3s decided during the last half, so we're confident in saying that we'll likely watch a quite enjoyable game. So far Mouz always managed to take the upper-hand, but in Bo1 games the performance drop over-time that plagued Titan will not occur, and with a smart veto there are good chances to watch them coming back from the Hell. Current CSGL odds are pretty off and skewed in favor of Mouz, while we're more trending in favor of Titan, and we suggest a Low bet on them.

This is the PGL 'Last Chance' upper-final, and just like the rest of the games played in this group it will be a Bo1, the only difference is that here we're talking about a couple of top-ranked Tier1 teams. Both NaVi Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1) and TSM Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) are fighting pretty hard since Cologne, overall TSM looked a bit better, but honestly the Bo1 is a quite inconsistent format, and this game will be very likely decided by a couple of personal plays together with some luck and a good veto session. At our end we believe we'll watch de_inferno as map, and if the veto goes so both rosters should be quite aligned, and we'll enjoy a pure 50/50 game, so we're oriented in suggesting to bet on the more rewarding odds, in this case NaVi.
http://csgo.guru/match/1601!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5293!$mouz!$Kinguin!$Kinguin!$0.5!$0.4!$0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Today we'll enjoy the last series of PGL 'Last Chance' matches, just like yesterday these games are chained, so we'll start with the current one, then we'll move forward to NaVi vs (winner of Mouz/Kinguin), and we'll end with the Group Final (played as Bo3) between TSM and the winner of the NaVi-Mouz/King match-up. This game and the following one will be played as Bo1, so as usual we'll enjoy a quite unpredictable fight, mostly decided by the veto-session together with some luck, rather than accurate planning. However we're sure that this will be a quite exciting game to watch. Both teams are currently rolling pretty fine, and looks like that Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) finally managed to re-acquire some self-confidence. Yesterday they managed to beat Dignitas with a clean 16-13 on Mirage and they ended the day with a 2-1 victory over Fsid3 in the FaceIT Qualifier Final, so we're sure they'll move here with a quite high motivation. On the other hand Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) are the hottest Tier2 team of the past two weeks, and looks like they're a step above Dignitas (they tilt frequently) and HR (they're inconsistent as hell). Additionally they already managed to take down Titan plenty of times in the short-term and they're the favorite candidate for switching with them in the Tier1 Olympus. Talking about the current match, current CSGL odds are skewed in favor of Kinguin mostly because two factors, the first one is the huge amount of Kinguin supporters scattered around the globe, but the 2nd is the previous Head to Head that these team had in early August during the PGL Qualifier, where Kinguin managed to take the Bo5 Final with a clean 3-0 score (Mouz later managed to Qualify via an 'Emergency Qualifier' happened as result of the EnvyUs's withdrawn). However we suggest to don't give too much importance to this result, since we're talking about a match happened in mid-summer and about a month ago. About the map, this time there are multiple possibilities since both teams share a kinda similar pattern, so the most likely options are de_mirage, de_train and de_overpass, but at our end we trend towards Mirage. If this will be the case, Mouz may have a little edge, but overall we're talking about a pure 50/50 game. Betting Odds are globally trending in favor of Kinguin, but as we stated above we really believe we'll enjoy a balanced game, so our pick is a Low bet on Mousesports.

Kinguin just rolled over Mouz in a pretty easy fashion, and this wasn't expected at all, in particular we weren't really expecting to watch de_train as pick, of course it was in the 'magic 3 circle' but also the worst choice for Mouz. About NaVi looks like they're currently facing some internal issues, and they easily turn angry to each other too frequently and mid-match, this is causing a drop in their performance and motivation, and for sure played a role in their 2-0 defeat against HR happened yesterday. However, they are a top-tier team, and they can handle a Bo1 even if not in their best condition. Current CSGL odds are quite aligned with our real-world ones, so we're oriented in going with a Low/Avg bet on NaVi.
http://csgo.guru/match/1636!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5298!$TSM!$Kinguin!$TSM!$0.65!$0.84!$-0.18999999999999995!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Just 10 Mins between the previous game and this one, so we'll just drop our pick for this game, which is an Avg bet on TSM, however Kinguin played really well against NaVi, in particular since they picked a map where usually the Ukranian side is pretty strong. We also need to note that the Kinguin's trend of picking NiP stand-ins is quite weird and should stop ASAP, since we're talking about crucial games in a pretty important League. Having issues is boring, but if they're aware of them they should simply grab an official backup (Just like Mouz did with NiKo - Spiidi).
http://csgo.guru/match/1637!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5323!$Fnatic!$TSM!$Fnatic!$0.6!$0.75!$-0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$AVG BET!$This is the only huge match scheduled for Today, and it will feature Fnatic and TSM battling through a quite unusual format, even if we're talking about a Bo5 game the prize-money will be split between maps, so unlike a normal Bo5 the match won't stop as soon as a team will take 3 maps and all the 5 maps will be played. However victory conditions are the standard ones, so Betting sites will consider it as a plain Bo5. Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) are on a quite convincingly streak, and they're the obvious favorite for taking this match, their form is still pretty high since their victory at ESL One Cologne, but we need to remember that in the past week they mostly faced Tier2 teams. Overall we're pretty sure we'll watch them taking at least 3 maps. On the other hand, TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) yesterday faced extremely hard times against Kinguin, and they managed to grab their PGL spot only after 2 maps ended in Overtime, for sure Kinguin were advantaged by playing with Get_Right instead of Fox (and this influenced their moral too), but a team like TSM should be able to manage a mix-team in a way more consistent way than the mess they displayed, and honestly their Gameplay was lacking of on-the-fly adjustments and it was kinda repetitive, something that won't work well against a team like Fnatic. However we need to say that this is a LAN match and not a messy online one, so this will for sure boost a bit their motivation and teamplay. About maps there isn't much to say since we're talking about a Bo5, and according to our Veto Pattern graph we'll very likely watch de_cbble and de_mirage vetoed off. Betting Odds are quite skewed in favor of Fnatic, but honestly this is quite correct since they're more consistent on the extended map-pool and (compared to TSM) a bit more dynamic and capable to fix their strats quickly according to the issues they're facing. At our end we're oriented in picking an Average+ bet on Fnatic, since we believe we'll watch them taking at least 3/5 of the maps, but we wouldn't be surprised to watch TSM offering an extremely serious challenge on de_dust2 and de_inferno.

Betting Odds are heavily trending in favor of CLG (Ranked 7th in Tier2, Form: 57.29), and for sure they're the better team according to their top-tier roster and the wide experience, additionally the Bo3 format is going to give them an extra hand too. However we don't suggest to mark Enemy (Unranked, Form: 52.1) dead to quickly, against coL they provided a really surprising performance; they're a new lineup who prefers a fast-paced (and kinda unpredictable) Gameplay so they could be a bit tricky to face in a LAN environment. Overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking a map (if they'll play the Veto smartly, something around: de_dust2, de_cache &amp; de_train) and providing an entertaining show. According to the Odds, the best pick is a #yolo ICB on Enemy, but if you don't have Cents to throw don't worry too much, and just skip without regrets.

Both teams already faced each other just few days ago, and Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) managed to grab a 2-1 victory after a quite shaky first map, then in the following days they somehow managed to fix some of their issues and currently they're on a quite nice streak and yesterday they displayed really good things against TSM too. On the other hand Efrag (Ranked 6th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) aren't bad at all, and the LAN environment may boost a bit their teamplay, even if we need to say that they didn't face any real top-tier opponent in the short-term (with the exclusion of Kinguin and HR), so we're not so sure we'll watch them taking more than a map. About the veto, in our opinion and according to our Veto Pattern graph, we'll likely watch : de_dust2, de_mirage and de_train. If it goes so, Dust2 may go to EFrag, while Mirage is in favor of Kinguin, and Train can easily go both ways. Overall the Betting Odds are pretty skewed in favor of Scream &amp; friends, but this match could be more tight than expected, so we don't see any reason for not attempting an ICB on the Bulgarian side.
http://csgo.guru/match/1643!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5350!$mouz!$Titan!$Titan!$0.45!$0.64!$-0.19!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match of the Gaming Paradise LAN currently taking place in Portoroz, Slovenia and actually one of the best games we'll enjoy today since both NaVi and VP will end playing against low-tier teams due the last second withdrawn of HellRaisers and Copenhagen Wolves. Mousesports and Titan battled extensively during the past week, they faced each other twice during the PGL S1 GroupStage, and in both occasions Mouz managed to take the upper hand by just a handful of dust; the first match-up was a Bo1 and ended 16-14, while the second was a Bo3 and finished 2-1 in overtime; so we're talking about a couple of teams that are actually really aligned. Overall Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) are probably rolling a bit better than Titan, and we can easily say that they are actually the most solid team in Tier2, however they still lack of consistence on the extended map pool and sometimes their Veto is a bit off, so overall they aren't a real issue for most of the top-tier teams yet. On the other hand, in the past few days Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) managed to raise their heads a bit compared to late August, and even if they're still quite far from their optimal form, they at least re-aligned with Mouz and they're still fighting in order to defend their Tier1 spot. Talking about the Veto Pattern, according to our graph there are good chances to watch : de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass. If it goes so, this is a fully 50/50 pool, and both teams are usually quite fine on all of these maps. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of Mouz, but honestly this is a bit weird since usually Mouz aren't really great in LAN matches, while Titan generally wake up a 'lil (mostly in minor tournaments like this one, in Majors they can't manage the pressure), so overall we're more oriented in suggesting a Low bet on Titan in order to take advantage of the better percentages.

Actually this is also one of the very first Bo3 games these teams play against each-other, since so far most of the H2H history is composed by Bo1s and Bo2s, so will be cool see how they'll perform on the extended map-pool and how they'll manage the veto session. In the short-term Luminosity (Ranked 4th in Tier2, Form: 57.32) are on a pretty great streak, and they didn't lose a single local match since they moved back from ESL One Cologne, even if we need to note that most of the teams they faced were way below the level of CLG. On the other hand CLG (Ranked 7th in Tier2, Form: 57.29) are on a similar streak, the only difference are a couple of Ties they managed to achieve in CEVO (against coL and Sponsorless), while we also need to remember that they won RGN NA over Liquid about a week after Cologne. So overall they look quite on point, and then there are extremely high chances to watch a close and balanced game. About the Veto Pattern, according to our graph we'll likely watch : de_cache, de_mirage and de_train. If it goes so, Cache should be in favor of CLG, while Mirage will likely go to Luminosity and Train is mostly a coin-toss. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of Luminosity, mostly because they managed to get the upper-hand in most of the previous H2Hs, but honestly this is a quite even game, both teams share a similar Form, and we wouldn't be surprised to enjoy the 3rd map and OTs, so our pick is a Low bet on CLG.
http://csgo.guru/match/1659!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5352!$Method!$NME!$Method!$0.56!$0.8!$-0.24!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Just a quick note about this game, since it's featuring pretty sweet Betting Odds, while in reality we'll very likely watch a pretty close game. Method are for sure a bit advantaged because they're sticking together since a quite long time (they're the former Fenix lineup) compared to Enemy, and in the short-term they also started providing promising results against top-5 teams, so for sure they are a team to watch. On the other hand Enemy technically shouldn't be too far, and their lineup is potentially a bit better, but their gameplay isn't mature yet and quite prone to dumb mistakes. As stated in the first line, Odds are quite skewed in favor of Method so an ICB on Enemy may pay off.

Overall SK played pretty well against D&amp;G and we're kinda surprised by the cold blood they displayed, additionally we need to note that they already managed to beat Hellraisers several times in the short-term and looks like that they know how to counter them effectively. Obviously HR are a high-ranked Tier2 team and even if lately they're experiencing issues they're obviously slightly favored. Betting Odds are heavily in favor of the CIS side, while we believe we'll watch a tough match, so our pick is a Low bet on SK.

This already caused them to lose a couple of really easy matches, and the only way to fix it is a lot of patience together with an heavy focus on timings and match dynamics. On the other hand SK (Ranked 5th in Tier3, Form: 50.6) are mostly affected by strats-related problem since they are unable to play consistently more than 2 rounds in a row. Honestly they were playing better with Hunden, and we believe that replacing him with Berry created confusion instead of improving things. About maps, our picks are : de_mirage, de_train (or de_overpass). If the veto goes so, Overpass (if picked) should be in favor of SK, while both Mirage and Train can easily go both ways. Betting Odds are in favor of the Danish side, but real-world odds are quite even, so we're oriented in going Low on eBettle, but there are also quite good chances to see a Tie.

On the other hand D&amp;G (Tier3, Form: 53.9) are clearly experiencing a slump, and looks like that the new lineup with Loord and Oskarish is even more inconsistent than the previous G2 one, yesterday they lost pretty badly against SK and few days before they even struggled in the DingIt weekly cup, for sure not the most relevant event out there. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_cbble, de_mirage and de_train. If it goes so Fsid3 should be better on both Cbble and Mirage, while Train will be kinda random. Betting Odds are currently widely skewed in favor of Flipsid3, and we believe they're favored too, but honestly the percentages are pretty bad for going with them, so we're more oriented in attempting a #yolo ICB on D&amp;G.

Talking about the match it self, NaVi (Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1) aren't experiencing their brightest moment, and their latest Online results were kinda disappointing, however this is a Lan match and the couple of days off they spent all together (courtesy of Gaming Paradise delays) may have fixed a bit the internal troubles that spiked up in the past weeks. On the other hand, Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) woke up a bit and started doing well within the Tier2, but for sure their attempt to qualify to PGL by using NiP stand-ins is something quite 'border-line' and casts a shadow on the promising results they achieved in the past few days. Anyway we need to say that their yesterday victory over E-Frag was really smooth and clean, while we were expecting a way closer score, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them performing well against NaVi too. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, there are good chances to watch : de_dust2, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto goes so, Dust2 may end in favor of Kinguin, while on both Mirage and Train we'll likely watch NaVi stepping-up. Betting odds are currently pretty even, but since we're talking about a Bo3 and a LAN game, we're more oriented in going for a Low bet on NaVi.

Currently VP (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) are doing pretty well and in the short-term they managed to beat most of the average T1 opponents, they only fell against EnvyUs, which is overall a pretty scary opponent. On the other hand Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) in the past weeks mostly battled with Tier2 teams rather than T1 ones, but looks like that they stepped up a bit on Lan and their performance (early today) against Mouz was pretty convincingly. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_cbble, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will follow this pattern, Cbble and Overpass should be quite balanced and aligned to 50/50, while Mirage is in favor of VirtusPro. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of VP due their better short-term performances and a solid H2H history in facing Titan, but honestly despite they are for sure advantaged percentages are really too skewed, and with these odds we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on Titan.

Yesterday night Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) managed to beat VirtusPro during a quite beautiful Bo3, we can easily say that they walked back from the hell since nobody was expecting a comeback on Train, a map where VP are usually pretty on-point; while early in the morning they easily rolled over Mouz with a fair and square 2-0 score. On the other hand Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) is currently on a pretty similar streak, they didn't face any issue in moving over E-Frag during Day1, and they surprisingly managed to beat NaVi despite a pretty weak start on de_mirage. Talking about maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph there are good chances to watch : de_train, de_mirage and de_overpass. If it goes so, both Train and Mirage can easily go both ways, while Overpass should be in favor of Titan. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Kinguin, but honestly this is a pretty balanced game, so we suggest to play the Odds and our pick is a Low bet on Titan.

However just keep in mind that we're talking about a CEVO Bo2 between two not so consistent teams, so you shouldn't be surprised to watch a Tie. HR (Ranked 1st in Tier2, Form: 63.8) in the past few days woke up a bit, and they moved from a pretty awful situation to a way better one, right now they are almost on par with the rest of hot-trending Tier2 teams (Mouz, Dignitas and Kinguin), and looks like that their victory over NaVi provided them an huge confidence boost. On the other hand D&amp;G (Tier3, Form: 53.9) are still extremely inconsistent, and they keep performing in a pretty random way, without following any real scheme or plan, in particular they seem to suffer in extended map-pool matches, and honestly we really doubt we'll watch them doing well in more than a map. About the veto, there are good chances to watch : de_overpass and de_train. If it goes so, HR should be better on Overpass, while Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of HR, and we kinda agree on this, so even if they aren't extremely rewarding we're oriented in picking an Average bet on HR. If you're feeling lucky, you can instead try an ICB on D&amp;G, but honestly we highly doubt they have chances to win more than a map.

NaVi (Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1) so far didn't impress too much, and yesterday versus Kinguin they managed to lose (for the 2nd time in a row) in a pretty dumb way, despite a not-so-bad veto and a promising start. On the other hand, Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) faced really hard times against Titan, and they failed to put up any serious fight, however we don't suggest to take a Lan match that suffered of 26+ hours of delay as extremely relevant (losing your focus is pretty normal when you need to wait so much). Talking about the Veto Pattern, there are good chances to watch de_dust2 as map, if it goes so we might watch a match slightly closer than expected, since Mouz are generally quite decent on this map. Betting Odds are trending in favor of NaVi, and this is quite correct since usually they're more solid on Lan compared to Mouz, and even if there are chances for watching a tough game, we've slightly more faith in GuardiaN and friends, so our pick is a Low++/Avg bet on NaVi.

E-frag (Ranked 6th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) are actually the only team together with Kinguin that managed to play during Day1, but unlike them, they didn't face any scary opponent on the following day, and they easily moved over MiA without any issue. Overall they're doing quite fine within the Tier2 but usually they're not capable to mess with T1 teams yet (but for sure the Bo1 format is going to help them a bit). On the other hand VP (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) warmed up with an easy 2-0 victory over CSGO-Saloon, but yesterday they lost pretty badly against Titan despite a quite promising start. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of VP, and we quite agree on this since the are good chances to watch de_mirage (or de_cache) as map, and VP should be able to grab this game with a score around 16-12, so our pick is a Low/Avg bet on the Polish side.

On the other hand Liquid (Ranked 10th in Tier2, Form: 58.5) finally replaced (after a pretty long trial) Flowsick with Hiko, and with this move they are hoping to step-up from their current 3rd place within the NA scene, however we need to note that currently their level is still below CLG, and Hiko isn't in a form comparable to 6 months ago yet. Talking about maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_train and de_mirage. If it goes so, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a close match since CLG are generally better on Dust2, while Liquid are usually pretty fine on Mirage and de_train can easily go both ways.

Additionally we need to note that Dignitas just switched Nico for Schneider, and this is a pretty huge change since the Swedish talent was semi-inactive since a while. In the short term Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.5) mostly faced teams below Tier3 and they struggled against the few ones above the waterline, while on the other hand HellRaisers (Ranked 1st in Tier2, Form: 63.8) magically woke up as soon as they managed to beat NaVi, and since then they rolled over a quite good series of T2-3 teams without any real issue. Talking about maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph both teams share a kinda similar trend on the new/updated maps, while they follow a totally different one regarding the classic pool. So we'll likely watch : de_overpass, de_train (or de_dust2). If it goes so, HR should be able to take Overpass, while Dignitas are advantaged on Train, and Dust2 (if picked) can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Dignitas, but honestly a 10% difference is too much for a match like this, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on HR, but there are also pretty high chances to watch just a Tie

As we stated many times already, their main problem is their heavy mid-game inconsistency, they are totally unable to follow the same pattern for more than a round. On the other hand Fsid3's teamplay improved a lot since S1mple left, but unfortunately now they lack of raw fire-power, and despite they consolidated their position within the Tier2, they still have issues in messing with high-ranked teams. The good part is that usually they show decent things against teams like SK, so we're confident we'll watch them winning at least a map. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch : de_train and de_cbble (or de_mirage). If the veto goes so, FlipSid3 (Ranked 5th in Tier2, Form: 56.6) should be better on both, while D2, if picked may go to SK. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Fsid3, obviously they are a bit more skewed than real-world ones, but honestly we kinda agree on this trend, and Fsid3 should be able to win at least a map and (in the worst case) Tie the match.

Obviously this is an online match, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Brazilian side waking up a little, however we're still talking about a really important tournament, and we're sure we will watch CLG taking this game very seriously too. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of CLG, and this is pretty obvious according to the recent Head to Heads between the two teams, honestly we kinda agree on this trend, and overall CLG are sporting a pretty high motivation and a good form, so our pick is a Low+ bet on them (but we're pretty sure we'll watch Luminosity taking a map, so avoid high values).

As we stated many times already EnvyUs (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8) are actually one of the very few teams with the potential to dethrone Fnatic from their 1st place in the World Ranking, however here we're talking about a game that looks like a minefield, and even if Envy are generally doing really fine and playing above the rest of Tier1 teams, we need to remember that Bo1 Lan games are always quite unpredictable and losing/winning is frequently matter of focus/luck rather than pure skill. On the other hand Cloud9 (Ranked 7th in Tier1, Form: 67.2) took a long break after their quite disappointing performance @ ESL One Cologne, an event where a wide part of the world was expecting from them a top-notch result, something that the North American lineup failed to deliver. Anyway, C9 have a quite long story in beating EnvyUs, and they always managed to read them pretty well, so despite EnvyUs are currently trending and rolling pretty hot we don't believe that real-world odds are far more different than just 60/40 in favor of the French side. Betting odds are currently way too skewed, so our pick is an ICB/Low bet on Cloud9 since we believe we'll watch a close match (much likely on de_overpass or de_train).

VirtusPro are set once again to face NiP, few weeks ago during ESL One Cologne they already managed to send the Swedish stars to packing their bags, thanks to a pretty fair and square 2-0 score, something that caused heavy turmoil within the NiP fanbase and resulted in Natu stepping back from his Coach position. Actually VP (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) are sporting an even better form, and they're backed by a set of quite solid performances in the short-term (we're not counting Gaming Paradise Nightmare, for obvious reasons), so overall there are good chances to watch them performing fine during the whole event. However, we're still talking about a Bo1 match, and NiP (Ranked 5th in Tier1, Form: 69.0) lately are inclined in coming back from the hell pretty quickly and unexpectedly, in particular in this case we need to note that they're playing with their cards covered, they didn't play any match in the short-term but they weren't on holiday either, so despite all the no-sense buzz about roster changes (that are not going to happen), we're quite sure they're are trying to move here with some fresh ideas in order to wash the mouth at several analysts calling them dead already (funny bonus fact: the same analysts 8 months ago were praising them like gods. As you know, jumping on 'trends' and tell the community what it want to hear is always easier than providing unbiased opinions. Easier but wrong.). Talking about maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, the most likely options are de_train and de_cache, in the first case we'll watch a pure 50/50 game, while on Cache VP should be advantaged. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of VP, but honestly we're more oriented in believing that we'll watch this game taking place on a neutral-field, on the other hand we cannot guess (yet) what NiP prepared for this event, so we'll just play the odds by going Low on NiP rather than risking an avg-high bet on VP without being aware of what NiP did in the past 3 weeks.

This shouldn't surprise you at all, since Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) are rolling extremely well since a pretty long time, they're solid and their teamplay is almost flawless, as icing on the cake their current winning streak is quite impressive too. On the other hand Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) are currently located in a limbo between Tier1 and Tier2, they are still fighting with top-ranked T2 teams in order to keep their T1 spot, while at the same time they're trying to fill the gap with the average T1 teams, overall this approach is giving alternate results together with a bag of mixed feelings to fans and audience. Talking about maps, the veto session is going to be pretty interesting, and there are several options available, in particular we believe that both Overpass and Cobblestone, if picked, may lead to match closer than expected. Betting odds are obviously heavily skewed in favor of Fnatic, and without any doubt they are favored, but honestly betting on them with percentages edging the 90/10 is pretty pointless, so the only rational way to bet is by picking a #yolo ICB on Titan. If you are scared about losing cents you can always skip and just enjoy the match.

Talking about NaVi (Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1), we will ignore the 'Gaming Paradise' results (as we did for VP), and even if they didn't do too bad at the Slovenian event, the overall situation was a real mess and altered the whole figure. However looks like that the current NaVi issues are mostly related to internal troubles rather than form related problems, the roster keep losing focus as soon as a couple of rounds don't go as they are expecting, so currently their trend can be shortened in the following: if they start the game by winning 5-6 rounds in a row they'll likely take the whole map, but if they start slowly by messing up the first pistol &amp; the following few rounds, there aren't good chances to watch them coming back. On the other hand the problem that TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) are currently experiencing is totally different from the NaVi one, and just related to form, the Danish side always focus on fewer events compared to other T1 teams, and the long pauses together with their inconsistent match schedule cause them to slump pretty randomly. Overall the TSM situation is a bit better compared to the NaVi one, even if the Bo1 format will likely mitigate the gap, so we're pretty sure we'll watch a pretty close match, in particular if de_dust2 or de_overpass will be picked as maps. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of TSM, and we're oriented in following this trend too, so our pick is TSM, but we suggest to stay Low in value.

EnvyUs (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8) probably had to sweat a bit more than VP, since Cloud9 started with the pedal to the metal, offering a quite good fight, but during the late second-half Happy and friends pushed the Turbo button and moved ahead, taking advantage of a couple of questionable ECOs at the North American side. On the other hand VirtusPro (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) didn't face any real issue, since NiP decided to suicide through a totally absurd veto session, something we ninja-covered via our live-tweeting already : #GuruLive : NiP actually took an huge risk in letting VP going for de_mirage, they should've banned it as first instead of Inferno. CSGO • Guru (@csgo_guru) September 10, 2015 About maps, we honestly hope for de_train, because if picked will be quite balanced and then we'll likely watch a very entertaining game, but there are also good chances to watch Cbble and if it goes so Envy will be favored. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of EnvyUs since they proved themselves a bit more in the first game, and overall they looked really focused. VP did quite fine too, but we still believe that their good form is limited to several maps only, and we're pretty sure that Envy, (unlike NiP) will not gift them anything, and the NiP fail probably already ringed a bell in their head. Our pick is a Low+ bet on EnvyUs.

Out of the two, Cloud9 (Ranked 7th in Tier1, Form: 67.2) are for sure the ones that did less mistakes, actually they're mostly paying the long inactivity right after ESL Cologne, but they still managed to scare EnvyUs a bit, unfortunately their late-game management was just horrible, and then they missed their chance to pull an upset. Not much to say about NiP (Ranked 5th in Tier1, Form: 69.0), as we stated in our Live Tweeting too, they totally messed up the veto session, and their bans were out of any logic. However these mistakes were off-game, obviously extremely relevant in a Bo1, but we still believe that with a correct veto we could've enjoyed a closer match. However, talking about the current game, this is basically a pure 50/50 one, in particular if NiP will finally avoid the no-sense veto mistakes and go for a map such as de_cbble or de_train, or at least whatever map different from de_mirage, de_cache or de_overpass. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of C9, but as we stated above real-world odds are mostly in the middle, so we're oriented in attempting a Low bet on NiP, with the hope to watch them waking up a little.

Fsid3 (Ranked 5th in Tier2, Form: 56.6) as we stated plenty of times in the past few days lost some fire-power from the departure of S1mple, but overall their team-play improved a lot, and their current form isn't too bad, so we doubt we'll watch them losing more than a map and there are actually some decent chances to watch a plain 2-0 in their favor. On the other hand Penta (Ranked 2nd in Tier3, Form: 53.6) are on a slump since 3 weeks or so, in the short-term they mostly played against local teams and even there they failed to impress too much, and honestly their current form isn't as good as it was in early summer. Our pick is an Average bet on Fsid3, mostly because we believe that in the worst case we'll watch just a Tie.

Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.5) as we wrote in the past days as well, are running a bit colder than late August, and despite they are still one of the 4 trending teams within the Tier2, they started facing some consistency issues, additionally Schneider is still quite out-of-form, and we're not so sure that swapping him with Nico will make things better. About Penta (Ranked 2nd in Tier3, Form: 53.6) we already wrote about them in the previous game, but by watching their game against Fsid3 looks like that they are probably a bit better than expected. However this is a Bo2 game, and Dignitas should be able to take at least a map, so our pick is an Avg bet on them (but well, betting odds aren't really great, so you can also skip without regrets).

Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) as expected didn't face any real issue in rolling over Titan on Cobblestone, and their executions were looking so easy that made us think that they still have plenty of margin. On the other hand TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) played an extremely good match against VP, and achieving a fair and square 16-10 victory on Overpass, where VP are usually quite on-point, isn't an easy task at all. Talking about the current match, Fnatic are obviously favored and the team to beat, honestly we don't believe they have any weak map in particular that TSM may use to make the game more even, maybe just Train may leave some doors opened, but the chances to watch it aren't extremely high. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Fnatic, and we agree on this, so our pick is an Avg bet on the Swedish side. However CSGL percentages are actually REALLY skewed, so also an ICB on TSM is a legit option (if you like cents), and for sure a bit more 'relaxed' pick than going high on Fnatic and then sweating like a bear in summer if the match will be -suddenly- closer than expected.
http://csgo.guru/match/1711!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5434!$Titan!$Na'Vi!$Titan!$0.5!$0.37!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Here is the Group B elimination match, and honestly both NaVi and Titan are the teams that have impressed less. NaVi (Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1) failed pretty heavily against TSM, despite they were playing on a map where they usually perform decently. Not much to say apart that their shots weren't landing fine at all, and even strats-wise most of the stuff was kinda messy and off-sync. On the other hand Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) managed to do even worse, they fell in every single bait that Fnatic set up, even the most obvious ones. Ex6tenz is usually a quite brilliant IGL, but in the first match he was a ghost, and without him leading, the whole Titan-machine basically never worked a single time. However we need to note that both teams took part @ Gaming Paradise early this week, and all the stress accumulated during that (awful) event could've played a role today. Talking about the current match, we're pretty sure we'll see de_overpass as map. If the veto goes so we'll very likely watch an extremely balanced match, since both teams already faced each other on this map plenty of times, and we always enjoyed extremely balanced games or OTs. Betting odds are trending in favor of NaVi mostly because Titan never turned on in the first game, but at our end we're more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Titan in order to take advantage of the skewed percentages.

CLG (Ranked 7th in Tier2, Form: 57.29) yesterday managed to lose against Luminosity in a pretty tight Bo3, but honestly this is an understandable result (they won against LG 3 times in a row, so Luminosity finally learned the previous lessons), in particular in online matches. However we're talking about a quite important game, so we believe we'll watch Liquid (Ranked 10th in Tier2, Form: 58.5) trying pretty hard too, even if we need to say that they're still a step below the level of CLG, and Hiko isn't extremely on-point yet, so in our opinion Liquid need a couple of more weeks in order to fill the gap. There isn't much to say about maps (since we're talking about a Bo5), so we'll just add that we'll very likely watch de_inferno and de_cache vetoed off. Betting odds are currently heavily skewed in favor of CLG, while real-world ones are more aligned around 60/40, anyway CLG are usually more consistent on the extended map-pool, and we believe we'll see them taking the match with a score around 3-1, then our pick is an Avg bet on them.

However it's fully possible to watch them losing one, and coL are actually the Tie-Masters of this CEVO season, since they managed to score draws in basically 90% of their games. On the other hand we wouldn't be surprised to watch Method doing fine if one of the maps will be a 'new' one, since on them most of these new rosters are quite aligned. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Complexity, and we kinda agree, so our pick is an Average bet on coL.

Honestly there isn't much to say, Betting odds are already extremely off, so this is mostly a nice match to watch rather than to bet on. Yesterday Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) surprisingly managed to lose against TSM, but it was deserved since the Danish side performed God-Like during OT, however de_dust2 is always a tricky map, and we don't even know why Fnatic didn't ban it, since it's one of the few maps where they are a bit below their average level. On the other hand Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) finally woke up a bit, and cleaned their poor entry game performances with a superb show against NaVi. For sure the Bo3 format is in clearly advantage of Fnatic, they are generally better on the extended map-pool, and there are good chances to watch a plain final 2-0 in their favor. As we stated above Betting odds are quite terrible, so you can either skip or try a #yolo ICB on Titan (but the chances to watch an upset are quite remote). With these percentages, there is no point in going High on Fnatic for basically no reward.

Both NiP and TSM provided a couple of crazy upsets, TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) yesterday evening managed to beat Fnatic in the Group B decider, by winning Dust2 thanks to a brilliantly executed Overtime. On the other hand NiP (Ranked 5th in Tier1, Form: 69.0) impressed even more, and early today they eliminated EnvyUs with a fair and square 2-0 in the Group A decider match. This is a result that nobody was expecting, in particular because the Swedish stars weren't rolling too well, since yesterday they lost by measure their first game against VirtuPro (here they made a couple of terrible veto mistakes) and then they edged elimination versus Cloud9 (finished in OT). But for sure this morning they looked revitalized. Talking about the current match, honestly the 2-0 that NiP scored against Envy is a bit more convincingly than the 1-0 in OT achieved by TSM vs Fnatic, but overall it's safe to say that we're talking about a quite balanced match. About maps, according to our Veto pattern graph, there are good chances to watch : de_dust2, de_train and de_inferno. While we highly doubt we'll watch de_mirage again. If the veto goes so, both teams should be aligned on all the three maps, and this is going to be a pure 50/50 game, featuring equal chances to go both ways. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of TSM, so we're more oriented in picking a Low bet on NiP in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

Currently VP (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) are on an impressive run, they rolled over both NiP and EnvyUs in a really easy fashion, but as we stated several times already, we need to remember that NiP screwed up the veto during the first match, while EnvyUs overall didn't look really fine, according to the fair and square scores that sent them to packing quite early. So maybe we should say that VP experienced a bit of luck as icing on the cake of their good performances. On the other hand, Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) despite a start with the pedal to the metal (they destroyed Titan 16-6), finished with crashing against the Danish Wall (TSM), here the Swedish side paid with an OT loss, the questionable choice of going for de_dust2. Talking about the current match, Fnatic are obviously advantaged, and even if they failed their Bo1 against TSM, they are still an extremely consistent team on the extended map-pool, and as the top1 team in the world they are without any doubt the roster to beat. However we wouldn't be surprised to watch VP playing their cards well, and we're pretty sure we'll watch them hitting the 3rd map, keeping the game on the edge. About the veto session, according with our Veto Pattern graph, we believe we'll watch : de_train, de_overpass and de_cache. If it goes so, Overpass should be in favor of Fnatic, while both Train and Cache will be pretty even. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Fnatic, and we kinda agree on this, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on them.

This evening we're going to enjoy a quite unusual match-up, since for once the last stage of an important league is not featuring CLG, but instead will provide us some fresh action thanks to an extremely interesting game between Luminosity and Liquid. Yesterday Liquid (Ranked 10th in Tier2, Form: 58.5), surprisingly managed to eliminate CLG in the Lower-Bracket final, during a totally mindblowing Bo5 that lasted till the 5th map. Overall we can say that Liquid is improving pretty quickly, even faster than what we were expecting. On the other hand Luminosity (Ranked 4th in Tier2, Form: 57.32) are moving here with a default 1-0 advantage due to coming from the Upper-Bracket. Just like Liquid they managed to beat CLG too, but their Bo3 was a bit less tight compared to the Bo5 we watched yesterday. Overall, the Brazilian side is composed by a pretty solid roster, and seems that in online games, without all the Lan-pressure their executions are way more polished and on-point. About maps, we just want to add that we'll very likely see de_inferno and de_dust2 vetoed off, with Inferno being an option too. After excluding the maps we mentioned above, both teams then share a kinda similar pattern, so we'll very likely experience a quite balanced match. We are oriented in believing that the default 1-0 gifted to Luminosity will boost their chances enough to let them take the whole game with a score around 3-1, but honestly the current Betting Odds are way too skewed, so we might try a #yolo ICB on Liquid, just in order to add some pepper into the salad.

Mythic are basically the former LG squad, and in our opinion this is a roster with an HUGE disrupting potential, unfortunately for them, they are currently running at around 50% of their full power. This is happening mostly due questionable management choices done during summer, together with the usual lack of patience at the North American end. Even if these players are currently acting more as a mix rather than a real team, we're still talking about an extremely experienced lineup, and honestly, despite we respect Method and we consider them a bunch of really promising youngsters, we highly doubt we'll watch them winning a Bo3 over Mythic. Betting odds aren't too bad, and currently still decent for a Low+ bet on DevilWalk &amp; friends, so this is our pick.

After a couple of quite crazy Semis we're stepping into one of the most unusual Finals of the year (so far). Both teams weren't on an exceptionally good streak in online matches, so watching them here is for sure something pretty unexpected, in particular because this is also one of the very first times where Fnatic failed to move to the final part of a Major-like event. VirtusPro (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) are actually the team that impressed us the most, we've to admit we were a bit skeptical about them during the previous games, and we were oriented in believing that luck played a role in their Groupstage matches, however we were wrong, and yesterday with a master-class performance against Fnatic they cleared all our doubts. There isn't much to add to this, when you send packing Fnatic, with scores like 16-4, 16-5 means you're on an hell of a form. On the other hand TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) faced slightly harder times against NiP, both teams were quite aligned in their Semi, and honestly we believe that NiP could have managed better the final part of de_inferno, instead they lost focus and TSM wisely used their brain to take the lead and send the Swedish side to home. Talking about the current game, we need to say that the Bo5 format will make this Final really interesting, since there are for sure a couple of maps, such as de_inferno and de_dust2 where TSM can definitively show good things, on the other side, VirtusPro looked really impressive on Train, Mirage and Cache, so in our opinion they should be slightly advantaged over the Danish side. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of TaZ and friends, and we kinda agree on this, since they showed an enviable team coordination together with enough cold-blood to fill a tank. We wouldn't be surprised to watch TSM setting up a fierce opposition, but honestly the Polish side is favored, so our pick is a Low+ bet on VP.

Additionally they already managed to steal a Tie to CLG in CEVO just a week ago, so there are good chances to watch them taking this game to the third map. On the other hand, CLG after a couple of months on the very top, are currently relaxing a bit too much, and in the past few days they struggled against both Liquid and Luminosity, their direct rivals in the NA World Ranking. Talking about the current match, even if CLG are sporting a form slightly below their average, they are still the favorite team, and for sure way more experienced on the extended map-pool. Betting Odds are trending in favor of CLG, and as explained above we agree with this, so our pick is an Average bet on them.

In its last iteration, we watched Liquid (Ranked 10th in Tier2, Form: 58.5) take the upper-hand during the PGL Lower-Bracket final, after a pretty competetive Bo5. Liquid then managed to grab a PGL Lan spot with a win over Luminosity, in a crazy game where they reversed the 1-0 LB disadvantage and delivered a stunning comeback. On the other hand CLG (Ranked 7th in Tier2, Form: 57.29) has slowed their run a bit as of late, and although we watched them peak a couple of weeks ago, the wind has now changed and Luminosity and Liquid seem to have a gain greater momentum. As for today's match, we're mostly anticipating a pure 50/50 game, and believe we'll watch a fairly balanced series of maps. We expect to see: de_train, de_dust2 and de_overpass. If the veto follows this pattern, de_train should be in slight favor of CLG, while Liquid will most likely grab Overpass. Leaving Dust2 to be the deciding map which can very easily go either way. All in all, this should make for quite the entertaining bo3 matchup Currently, betting odds are pretty balanced, but at our end we're a bit more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on CLG, since we believe that there is a good chance to watch them resurge some and fill the gap they've accumulated over the past days (additionally Odds are a bit more rewarding).

Liquid advanced here after an incredible performance against CLG, and quite honestly we were expecting a much closer game. Yet Hiko &amp; friends managed to make it look easy, and so Liquid advanced to the Final with confidence, courtesy of a fair and square 2-0 sweep. Opposite them, Luminosity had to sweat way way way more, in their match versus Conquest, which turned out to be a mind-blowing affair. Surprised again we were kinda stunned by the huge effort that Conquest has demonstrated in these matches. If they'll keep playing with this mindset we're pretty sure we'll have another prominent competitor for the NA top-3. Anyway, it wasnt enough to top Luminosity who ended by winning the last map after 3 crazy Overtimes. But it is worth noting the match was rather balanced and could of gone either way. By contrast Liquid has definitely looked to be the dominant team in this competition. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_mirage and de_overpass. If it will go so, Mirage should be in favor of Liquid, while both Cache and Overpass can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Liquid, but according to their form we kinda agree on this trend, so our pick is a Low+ bet on them.

Talking about the current match, Penta aren't doing really fine, and after a peak during early summer looks like they started slumping again, so far they failed against most of the T2-3 teams around, frequently with scores below the acceptable, and overall without being a threat. Mouz during the last week slowed a bit their run, but they are still one of the better performing T2 teams, and one of the candidates for a Tier1 spot. We highly doubt we'll watch them losing twice against Penta, and in the worst case we'll see a Tie. Betting odds are currently pretty off, but this is a kinda normal since we're mostly talking about a quite safe game, so you can either Skip (odds aren't rewarding after-all) or go High on Mouz.

CompLexity is currently playing very well with their only loss in their last 5 matches coming from CLG. This is a team that is doing pretty well for the Tier3 standards and we have them ranked with a Form of 54.8. This will change as they continue to win and impress. Roca and team will for sure put up a great match tonight, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them winning at least a map. Mythic is currently sporting a Form of 53.48 and we need to note how well they performed in the past few days, with a victory over Conquest and an amazing fight against Luminosity. We will watch Pyth and his nationally mixed team go to work tonight and try to take the 2 to nothing win. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, there are good chances to watch : de_dust2 and de_cobblestone. If it goes so, we'll very likely watch coL doing fine on Dust2, and Mythic taking Cobblestone. This is going to be a very close match. It would not surprise us if we saw a tied outcome here. With the current Betting Odds being very off and considering we see this as a 50/50 match and we are suggesting a Low bet on compLexity, in order to take advantage of the better percentages.

They seem to be coming along nicely and chemistry seems to be flowing, honestly what they achieved during the past week is just impressive, and something that nobody was expecting to happen in a such short timeframe. Enemy has been in a slight slump. They are still trying to gel their team chemistry with the recent addition of Relyks just a few weeks back. However despite on Lan they displayed good and promising things, their online performances are still extremely inconsistent. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, there are good chances to watch : de_dust2 and possibly de_inferno. If it goes so, on Inferno Conquest should be advantaged, while on Dust2 can easily go both ways. Lastly, we believe that Conquest will win this Bo2 (or at least they should be able to grab a Tie). However with the Betting odds being highly skewed, you can either go High on Conquest or just skip and enjoy the match (this is not an extremely profitable game anyway, so you can skip without regrets)!
http://csgo.guru/match/1803!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5505!$Ukraine!$France!$France!$0.5!$0.29!$0.21000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the first World Championship match we're covering in this season, usually we avoid them until Playoffs because they're extremely inconsistent and most of the countries involved don't play these Qualifiers seriously. However this is for sure a nice match-up, and probably the best one so far. Ukraine is fielding a mix between NaVi and HR players (S1mple just joined HR), with Bondik (actually the most consistent Fsid3 player, ranked #21 as Rifler, Form: 67.5) as icing on the cake. France is replying with a core composed by current/former EnvyUs players (Shox, Apex, Kennys, Happy) together with Rpk, who lately stepped up a lot. For sure the French lineup is extremely interesting, since most of these players are used to play together since a long time, and even if lately the shuffle mixed them, they still work well together. On the other hand, The Ukrainian roster looks a bit experimental, S1mple isn't playing seriously since he moved out from Fsid3, and he still has to play his first game with the HR shirt. Zeus and Edward are for sure a couple of solid picks, while Ange1 is a bit like Rpk, he started slow but currently he's doing quite fine. Betting odds are trending in favor of France, and this is understandable due the Envy-core, but honestly we're talking about a Bo1, so real-world odds are just in the middle and the match can easily go both ways, in particular if we'll watch a new map. Our pick is a Low bet on Ukraine in order to take advantage of the skewed odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/1806!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5543!$NiP!$EnVyUs!$NiP!$0.5!$0.44!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$First top match of the day, and also first match of the new ESL ESEA Season. Overall a pretty interesting Bo1 on map where both teams used to show good things. EnvyUs (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8) played Train plenty of times during early-mid summer, but lately they started vetoing it consistently and they slowly moved their focus -again on Classic maps (but according to what they displayed @ Dubai, we don't believe it paid off). Honestly, according to their recent history and the lack of focus on Train, we find them a slightly more risky pick than NiP. On the other hand, NiP (Ranked 5th in Tier1, Form: 69.0) woke up a bit in Dubai, and despite a quite slow start, their confidence started flowing match after match, and for sure having Heaton behind their heads provided a way higher moral boost than a 'standard' coach. NiP are also one of the teams that trained de_train more, they've played really an impressive amount of matches on this map (compared to most of the others T1 teams), and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them playing it decently-good one more time. Betting odds are currently a bit skewed in favor of Envy, but after-all we're talking about a pure 50/50 match that can easily go both ways, in particular since we're talking about an heavy CT-sided map. Our pick is a Low bet on NiP, mostly because Envy in the short-term looked quite inconsistent.
http://csgo.guru/match/1807!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5515!$Fnatic!$Titan!$Fnatic!$0.6!$0.8!$-0.20000000000000007!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$Second Bo1 of the day, this time we're moving into FaceIt Stage3 and the map isn't known yet. There isn't much to say about this match since Betting odds are already pretty off and overly skewed in favor of Fnatic, despite the Swedish side displayed some limits during the Dubai Invitational. Honestly, in the previous H2Hs Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) looked pretty fine against Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2), and during their match-up in Dubai at some point we started believing that they weren't playing seriously, some plays were edging the Trollish. However Bo1s aren't really consistent, and a little mistake during the Veto may complicate things pretty quickly, for example in this case we might watch a match closer than expected if Dust2 will be picked. Overall we find an ICB on Titan a smarter pick, since the odds for Fnatic are for sure too skewed and not really profitable.
http://csgo.guru/match/1808!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5540!$EnVyUs!$TSM!$EnVyUs!$0.45!$0.45!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Top-tier game and our second Match of the Day (first was NiP-Envy). Honestly EnvyUs aren't running fine at all, the moral-boost provided by the former Titan's duo (KennyS + Apex) faded like morning fog in the sunshine, leaving behind a series of pretty serious structural issues and a quite huge confusion, (looks like they don't have precise roles anymore, and at some point, vs NiP felt like there were 5x Rambo's running around without any precise plan in mind), and maybe it's time to take a short break, clarify things, and then comeback stronger. The next months will be filled by events, so better taking care of issues now than later. On the other hand TSM had an impressive run @ Dubai, for sure they didn't manage to match VirtusPro, but overall they did pretty well. They're moving here already well warmed up by their previous game against HR, and usually de_inferno is a map where they perform pretty fine, in particular as T. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of TSM, but this is quite normal according to how poorly Envy played against NiP, however Inferno will be very likely a bit more balanced, in particular if Envy will manage to play the CT side properly. Our pick is a Low bet on TSM, since the percentages are still pretty decent for betting in this way and their form is generally higher.
http://csgo.guru/match/1809!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5544!$SK!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.25!$0.29!$-0.03999999999999998!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Not an easy match as may look at first sight, SK (Ranked 5th in Tier3, Form: 50.6) are for sure extremely inconsistent but if picked during the 'right evening' they're fully capable to provide serious troubles. However we need to remember that yesterday they lost their chance to move to the DreamHack Cluj-Napoca (off-line qualifier), due their fail against MIXCAT, and honestly nobody was expecting a plain 2-0 victory in favor of the Finnish mix. So overall we're pretty sure that the moral at the SK end isn't currently flying too high. On the other hand NaVi (Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1) played a pretty disappointing Dubai Invitational, showing quite few ideas together with a series of too basic (and easily predictable) strats. Usually on de_cache they're just average, and they frequently struggled against T1 teams, however SK are a Tier3 one, so in our opinion we'll watch Guardian and friends taking the upper hand, and pick is an Average bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/1810!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5545!$mouz!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.33!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty interesting match, NaVi (Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1) as we stated in the previous match (SK vs NaVi), are coming from a quite disappointing campaign @ Dubai, and honestly we wouldn't be surprised to watch them experiencing some issues against a top-ranked Tier2 teams such as Mouz, in particular on a classic map as de_inferno where they already struggled during Gaming Paradise (quite irrelevant result tbh) and PGL (this is more relevant). Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) overall are doing pretty fine, they're a solid lineup, but we don't suggest to take too seriously their latest few so-so results, since they are from Gaming Paradise. Additionally Mousesports are usually a bit better online than on Lan, and their performances are generally a bit more on-point in Bo1 matches rather than extended map-pool ones. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of NaVi, and this is quite obvious since we're talking about a Tier1 team, however we don't suggest to overlook Mouz, in particular on de_inferno where they already managed to provide a serious fight against Envy. At our end we're a bit more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Mouz than going with NaVi with the risk to watch them playing Dubai-like again.
http://csgo.guru/match/1812!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5542!$HR!$TSM!$TSM!$0.3!$0.18!$0.12!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This will be the first game featuring S1mple with the HR shirt, but he probably needs to drop his hopes for a debut with a victory, since unfortunately Kucher will be unavailable and then HellRaisers will play with Fix instead of him. Honestly we don't believe they'll be capable to offer an on-par performance against a well-organized team such as TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7), and even if TSM are just back from Dubai and they spent the last few days resting, they should be capable to take the upper hand in most of the maps (an exception could be de_cbble, but we doubt we'll see it). Our pick is ab Average bet on TSM, mostly because we find HR a bit too "work in progress" and messing with T1 teams with 2/5 of their roster composed by stand-ins or new players is for sure a plain &amp; unneeded risk.
http://csgo.guru/match/1813!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5541!$HR!$G2!$G2!$0.45!$0.3!$0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$As announced few days ago, Team Kinguin moved to Gamers2, so this is their first match under the new tag, and honestly they have good chances to take home a victory. HellRaisers as we mentioned in their previous match, are playing with S1mple, and Fix is currently subbing for Kucher, so basically they'll very likely play more like a mix rather than a real team. We also need to note that G2 (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) improved a lot in the short-term, and even if we're not oriented in taking their Gaming Paradise victory as extremely relevant, we still need to admit that their team-play and coordination stepped up a lot compared to few weeks ago, and actually they're part of our poker of Tier2 teams with good chances to move to Tier1 soon. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the former TK lineup, and we kinda agree on this since both teams usually share a similar veto, and if they will end on a map such as Overpass or Train, G2 should be able to take advantage of their better tactical awareness. Our pick is a Low-Avg bet on G2.
http://csgo.guru/match/1817!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5535!$Titan!$FSid3!$Titan!$0.58!$0.76!$-0.18000000000000005!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This is the only EU Bo2 we'll enjoy today, and will feature Titan, who earlier today lost by measure against Fnatic, and Fsid3 that recently stepped-up a bit and managed to develop a pretty decent teamplay, even if they still lack of raw firepower in several tight situations where personal plays are required. This time Titan displayed slightly better things compared to when they played against Fnatic in Dubai, however the final result isn't something relevant yet, but at least they jumped in the game with a plan. On the other hand Fsid3 are generally pretty fine against T2-3 teams, where they can just play smartly and take advantage of better positioning and corners, but usually they struggle a bit more when they have to face unpredictable players and quick fakes. Real-world odds for this game are around 55/45 in favor of the French side, but there are also pretty good chances to watch a Tie, in particular if we'll see de_cbble and de_overpass as maps. Betting odds are currently pretty skewed in favor of Titan, but honestly we doubt we'll watch them losing twice, so we're oriented in picking a Low/Avg bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/1818!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5546!$mouz!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.13!$0.27!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Interesting match, but not much to say since Betting Odds already turned into 90/10 in favor of Fnatic. Obviously the Swedish side is favored, but actually we don't suggest to go with them for basically no reward. We also need to remember that Mouz recently put up a pretty good fight against Fnatic, during the PGL Group B Final, so there are chances for watching a match a bit closer than expected, but overall Fnatic should be able to take the upper hand. This is mostly a good match to watch rather to bet on, so you can just skip (without regrets, according to the odds) or go for a #yolo ICB on Mouz, just to add some pepper into the salad.
http://csgo.guru/match/1832!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5537!$Orgless!$LG!$null!$0.25!$0.09!$0.16!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Not much to say here since Betting Odds have already turned to trash. And overall, we're talking about a game that will very likely end in favor of Luminosity without much surprise. Unlike the previous match-ups, this is a CEVO Bo2, so in the worst case we'll probably just watch a Tie, particularly since we highly doubt to see LG lose twice in a row. As stated above, Betting Odds are pretty terrible and not profitable, so you can either Skip (without regrets) or feed your betting addiction with an High bet on LG, but honestly it's not worth the hassle.
http://csgo.guru/match/1835!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5571!$SK!$TSM!$TSM!$0.25!$0.12!$0.13!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Not much to say about this match, SK (Ranked 5th in Tier3, Form: 50.6) are promising, but as we stated yesterday their fail against MixCat prevented them to compete in the next Major (at least in the offline qualifier) so their moral right now isn't extremely high. Yesterday they didn't too bad against NaVi, in particular during the first half, but unfortunately for them in the second one NaVi stepped up, and the Danish side failed to offer any serious resistance. However, here the map is de_dust2, then TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7), according to their latest results, shouldn't face any real issue in rolling over SK. Betting odds are already pretty off and overall not really profitable, so you can either skip (without regrets) or go High on TSM (but the reward in this case is quite poor).
http://csgo.guru/match/1836!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5570!$Titan!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.4!$0.34!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$French derby, and for sure one of the most interesting games scheduled for today. Early in the summer both lineups mixed their players, Kennys + Apex moved to EnvyUs and Smithzz + Shox switched to Titan. This is one of the very first direct match we'll enjoy since these roster changes, so we are expecting to watch a pretty cool game, in particular because it will take place on de_train, a map usually quite prone to upsets. Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) in the short-term played on Train in a bit more successfully way compared to Envy (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8), but honestly we're talking about two teams that are more oriented in playing here against T2-3 teams rather than Top-tier ones, so we wouldn't be surprised to see a match a bit closer than expected. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of Envy, mostly because on the paper they are the strongest roster, but lately they are also pretty inconsistent, while on the other hand Titan are a bit in a slump and they're more focused in defending their T1 spot from the assaults of the top-ranked T2 teams, rather than studying the rest of T1 teams. At our end we're a bit more oriented in trying a Low bet on Envy, mostly because we're not fans of how Titan handle the late-game (looks like they've issues in managing the 2nd half of the matches, which is crucial in an heavily ct-sided map such as train).
http://csgo.guru/match/1837!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5572!$G2!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.2!$0.2!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$For sure a match-up to watch! Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) slowed a bit their run during their past week, but even if they looked vulnerable to top-ranked Tier1 teams, they are still off-limits for most of the Tier2 ones. On the other hand the former Kinguin squad, now known as G2 (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7), improved a lot, they managed to win Gaming Paradise (not extremely relevant tbh) and currently they're sitting on a quite nice streak, however yesterday they struggled a bit too much against HR, and for sure they'll need a way better performance if they want to hope for a tight match against Fnatic. The map for this Bo1 is not known yet, but in our opinion there are good chances to watch de_mirage or de_dust2, and in both cases should be a decent option for G2, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them starting to the pedal to the metal, but honestly the chances to see them keeping the lead till the end aren't too high. Betting odds are extremely skewed in favor of Fnatic, so we're more oriented in attempting a #yolo ICB on G2, with the hope to watch them taking advantage of the yesterday's update (on the paper it should help them a bit, since they are sporting a roster composed by pure aimers).
http://csgo.guru/match/1838!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5573!$E-Frag!$FSid3!$null!$0.5!$0.69!$-0.18999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Here we've a pretty interesting Tier2 match, in the short-term Flipsid3 (Ranked 5th in Tier2, Form: 56.6) experienced a quite bumpy road, but as we stated plenty of times in the past few days, currently they're sporting a pretty solid teamplay and they are sitting solidly exactly in the middle of the Tier2. On the other hand EFrag (Ranked 6th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) are apparently on a way better streak, but we need to remember that they mostly faced teams around T3 and below, so in our 'filtered' match history (we ignore by default teams ranked below T3) you can easily check how they struggled against a wide part of T2 and T1 teams, with their last relevant victory dated back in late August. Unlike the previous matches, here we're talking about a CEVO Bo2, and then we wouldn't be surprised to watch a Tie, in particular if we'll watch de_inferno and de_mirage as maps. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Efrag for basically no-reason, while real-world ones are around 50/50. Our pick is a Low bet on Fsid3 in order to take advantage of the skewed percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/1839!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5574!$NiP!$SK!$NiP!$0.7!$0.88!$-0.18000000000000005!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say, just like the previous game where SK faced TSM, we highly doubt we'll watch the Danish side (Ranked 5th in Tier3, Form: 50.6) taking the upper hand against NiP (Ranked 5th in Tier1, Form: 69.0), in particular on de_inferno, a map where the Swedish talents are usually quite on-point. To be fair SK, aren't too bad on Inferno (for the Tier3 standards), but facing an average T2 team isn't like messing with NiP, so despite we believe they could be able to take 10 rounds or so, we don't think they stand many chances for taking home the game. Betting odds are obviously way skewed in favor of NiP, so once again you can either skip (without regrets since the percentages are quite off) or go for an High bet on F0rest and friends (NiP).
http://csgo.guru/match/1840!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5576!$Fnatic!$TSM!$Fnatic!$0.5!$0.62!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Match of the day, and the game most of us are waiting in order to check if Fnatic will be able to take their revenge after their defeat @ Dubai. TSM (Ranked 5th in Tier3, Form: 50.6) yesterday looked a bit rusty, for sure a consequence of the few days off the took right after Dubai. Against HR they played a pretty bad first half, and with a bit more focus (and a non-mix roster) HR could have managed to grab an upset, something that didn't happen because TSM at some point woke up. The following match, against EnvyUs, went even worse, here the Danish side failed to put up any plan, and despite they fragged a lot (even more than the Frenchmen) they ended with a quite heavy loss. On the other hand, Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) looked pretty on-point in their last couple of matches, and honestly their fail @ Dubai is probably just a single unlucky 'episode' rather than a real trend. About the map, we're pretty sure we'll watch a replay of Dubai, so again de_dust2, basically the re-match we are all waiting for. Betting odds are in favor of Fnatic, and we kinda agree on this trend since they're still the Top1 and overall quite solid on most of the map-pool, additionally they are also quite consistent in Online matches.
http://csgo.guru/match/1841!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5577!$HR!$mouz!$mouz!$0.45!$0.33!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite nice match between a couple of high-ranked Tier2 teams, both aiming for a T1 spot. HR just refreshed their lineup with the addition of S1mple, but unfortunately for them, this is ESL Pro League and then they can't field him due his ESL ban, so we'll have Fix playing instead. Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) aren't on a great streak, but historically they always played de_cbble in a pretty decent way, for sure their lineup is way more stable than HR, so we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 match with just a slightly advantage in favor of the Germans, due the better roster stability. Betting odds are a bit mixed, community ones are favoring Mouz, mostly because the solid lineup (as we stated above), while betting providers are more trending in favor of HR due the better short-term results. Honestly at our end we find this match quite risky and we suggest to play the odds, so our pick is a Low bet on HR (or Mouz if you're going with $$$).

On the other hand TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) are for sure pretty good on this field, they rolled over Fnatic @ Dubai, and even if yesterday they looked a bit shaky they are still running pretty hot. Betting odds are currently in favor of TSM, and this is quite obvious, but honestly Titan could have slightly more chances than most of the people are expecting, so we're more oriented in trying an ICB on Titan rather than going high on TSM.

Betting odds for this game are already pretty off, and not that profitable, while CSGL ones have just come available. Honestly we don't expect to watch Luminosity lose two consecutuve maps, so this is a fairly safe match, which at worst would result in a Tie. Again percentages are not amazing, but this is quite common to the Bo2 match format, so our pick is an Avg-High bet on LG.

For sure the RGN Freedom Cup isn't the most relevant event out there, and most of the top-teams joined it mainly for training purposes, however this is still a pretty good match-up. Conquest, as we already discussed in the previous matches, remain on their amazing streak, and day after day they continue to impress us more and more. In actuality they are playing at a skill-level very similar to that of CLG. Obviously they don't have any international experience yet so we cannot provide proper ranking, but based solely on what they've shown so far we wouldn't be too surprised to watch performing at a level on par with most of the Euro T2 teams. Conversely, CLG are for sure slightly more experienced, but currently they've been slumping a bit and over the past few days they lost a pretty impressive series of games. Their loss yesterday against coL truly surprised us, since they tilted pretty badly during the CT side on Overpass, a map usually favorable to CT play. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of CLG, but we believe that real-world odds are more aligned to even, so we don't see any reason not to wager Low on Conquest.
http://csgo.guru/match/1852!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5581!$Orgless!$NME!$NME!$0.45!$0.62!$-0.16999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Here we have a pretty random Bo1 between a pair of promising teams. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of Orgless, but honestly, theres not much to support this. They did beat Enemy previously, but it was a very close match, and overall they haven't really achieved anything significant, aside from 1-1 draw against CLG in a match where the maps weren't optimal for CLG. On the other hand Enemy hasnt been doing extremely well either, and currently find themselves sitting on a pretty bad streak, but to their benefit we've at least been seeing some improvements, and yesterday with slightly more effort they could have managed an upset against coL. As mentioned above, Betting Odds are pretty skewed while real-world ones are more aligned to the middle, so our pick is a Low bet on Enemy.

This is by far one of the most interesting match-ups of the whole CS scene, and always a great one to watch and enjoy. On the left side we've NiP (Ranked 5th in Tier1, Form: 69.0), a team that many were calling dead too early, while they were just experiencing a drop in motivation, which is kinda understandable at this level and in particular when you play the game since the very beginning. Their performance in Dubai was quite interesting, they started pretty slow, but then in the following games they finally managed to achieve some of the 'heavy victories' they were looking for, and this has been enough to put them on the right path again. Actually in the short-term they played in a pretty consistent way, and they're moving here after a couple of relevant victories. On the other hand Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08), are good as usual, they've been a bit unlucky during Dubai, but overall they're still the team to beat, and they clearly showed this in the past week by collecting a poker of pretty easy victories against relevant T1-T2 opponents. Talking about the match it self, NiP never played de_cache in an extremely good fashion, while Fnatic are generally better at it. However we need to note that today Dennis will play instead of Krimz, and this change will play a role in keeping the real-world odds aligned around the middle. Betting odds are pretty skewed in favor of Fnatic, but honestly we're a bit more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on NiP, since we believe that F0rest and friends will try to take advantage of the Krimz's absence.

For sure de_dust2 as map is an interesting pick, in particular considering that Fnatic are playing with Dennis instead of Krimz, and this is one of the few maps where they aren't aliens. However we doubt we'll watch HellRaisers taking advantage of this, since they can't field S1mple too (due his ESL ban) and they're playing with Fix. So overall the whole thing is the same, and Fnatic are still clearly advantaged. Additionally HR are a bit in a slump since few weeks, and not really on par with the top-trending Tier2 teams (Mouz/Dignitas/G2). Our pick is an High bet on Fnatic, but honestly you can also skip without regrets since we're not talking about a really rewarding game.
http://csgo.guru/match/1856!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5615!$Titan!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.4!$0.23!$0.17!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Just another French derby, and one more chance for Titan for taking their revenge over EnvyUs. This is a match-up we already enjoyed yesterday, and stuff didn't go too well for Titan, who lost de_train by measure, and once again they failed to impress (however they redeemed themselves in the following match vs TSM, finished in OT). This time they'll face each other on de_mirage, a map where both teams never excelled at. Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) are trying to learn Mirage since a pretty long time, but despite all their attempts, they never managed to step over an Average level, enough to play on par against T2 teams, but for sure quite far from the level displayed by most of the top-ranked T1 teams. On the other hand EnvyUs (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8) never been huge fans of this map, and they consistently vetoed it, but despite this behavior we need to say that they always managed to play it in an acceptable way, even without any specific focus/training. Overall we believe we'll watch a bit more balanced match compared to yesterday, so we're oriented in taking advantage of the extremely skewed betting odds by going for an ICB on Titan.

Just like Envy-Titan also TSM and Fnatic already faced each other yesterday (on de_inferno), and Fnatic managed to roll over the Danish side without sweating too much. Unlike yesterday, this game will take place on de_train, a map where both teams always showed good performances, and where Fnatic could be slightly disadvantaged due the absence of Krimz, since here quick rotations and on-point timings are extremely important due the large scale of the map. Betting odds are still pretty balanced and quite around the middle, and this is something we agree with, since we really believe we'll watch a way closer game than yesterday. Even without Krimz Fnatic are probably still a bit advantaged, but at our end we're more oriented in believing in an 'official' roster and in a solid teamplay, so our pick is a Low bet on TSM.

EnvyUs are clearly several steps ahead of EzSkins, and for sure this will be an extremely difficult match for the British side. Recently Envy hasn't performed too great against the rest of T1 teams, but in this case they should be able to take a victory in a pretty easy fashion. Betting odds are naturally super-skewed in favor of Envy and not profitable at all, so you can just skip this game without regrets (or go High on Envy if you enjoy winning Bizons).
http://csgo.guru/match/1952!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5641!$Dignitas!$Renegades!$Dignitas!$0.55!$0.59!$-0.039999999999999925!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Here we actually have a pretty interesting match. The last time we enjoyed a Renegades (Ranked 9th in Tier2, Form: 58.4) match was during ESL One Cologne, where they managed to beat Titan, only to be shot down by NiP the following game. Honestly they are a team of promise, despite having played far less 'reference matches' compared to the Euro teams. But we believe they fully deserve their Tier2 spot, when considering what they've managed to demonstarate in the last 6 months. On the other hand, Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) are coming from a couple of disappointing weeks, and only in the last few days they managed to wake up a bit, thanks to a couple of good performances against Penta &amp; Reason. For sure they are still paying their recent lineup changes (they switched Nico with Schneider), and they probably still need slightly more time in order to adjust their gameplay accordingly. As displayed in our Veto-Pattern graph, there are good chances to watch de_mirage as map. If the veto will go so, we'll likely watch a pretty close match, since both teams are usually quite good on this map (Mirage is where the Aussies won over Titan @ Cologne). Betting odds are trending in favor of Dignitas, and this is pretty normal since they are a bit more 'known' than Renegades, but from a non-biased point of view the real-world odds are more aligned to the middle, and at our end we're a bit more oriented in playing with them and then going for a Low bet on Renegades.
http://csgo.guru/match/1953!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5642!$TSM!$CW!$TSM!$0.6!$0.87!$-0.27!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$Just another match featuring some pretty skewed Betting Odds. TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) are for sure one of the teams that currently are running with some momentum, however in their few recent online matches they seemed a bit off focus. In particular against other T1 teams where they didn't shine at all. On the other hand, we don't believe that under-estimating CPHW (Tier3, Form: 55.0) is a good idea either. Although TSM has established themselves as a great team, we need to note that the new CPH Wolves roster is currently quite interesting with potential. Most of these players are extremely experienced and perfectly capable of matching up with T1 opponents. Additionally, you should also consider that we're talking about a Bo1 where luck will play an inevitable role as well. As displayed above, TSM are clearly favored, but the real-words odds should be more closely aligned to 60/40-35, while most of the Betting odds are way more skewed (and not really profitable), so we're more oriented in going for a #yolo ICB on CPHW rather than going High on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/1954!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5649!$G2!$SK!$G2!$0.6!$0.8!$-0.20000000000000007!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Actually one of the best match-ups we have to look forward to during the first day of DreamHack London. Just to note, HLTV isn't displaying the correct match-history for G2/ex-Kinguin, as there are plenty of matches are missing (mainly the Gaming Paradise ones.) So we suggest referencing our very own short-history for a correct overview (which you can find below). However, Regarding Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7), we must acknowledge they have currently stepped up a lot. They are still a bit shaky against low-tier teams and frequently end with scores a bit too close, but overall and according to their performances in T1 games we can easily put them in the poker of teams aiming for a promotion to Tier1. On the other hand SK (Tier3, Form: 50.6) aren't too bad, but recently their performances haven't really been on par with those in August, sugesting they are in a bit of a slump. Anyways, the Bo1 format will surely be to their slight benefit (in particular if we see de_overpass as map), and with a smart veto they could be able to make G2 sweat a bit. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of G2, and we agree with this. Even if we believe that the current percentages are a bit off, we need to say that G2 are generally better than SK, in particular on Lan, so our pick is Gamers2 and we suggest a Low++/Avg bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/1980!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5652!$EnVyUs!$Dignitas!$EnVyUs!$0.6!$0.85!$-0.25!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$The previous game just finished, and so this match-up had just been determined. We've only a couple of mins in order to cover it before the start. Betting odds are obviosuly in favor of Envy, and honestly they are unquestionably the better team. Dignitas looked a bit shaky against Renegades and still managed to win but they still risked a lot in the late part of the game, despite playing the CT side of Cbble. Our pick is an Avg-High bet on Envy.
http://csgo.guru/match/1981!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5653!$ES!$Renegades!$ES!$0.3!$0.11!$0.19!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Again not much to say. EZskins don't quite look on par at all with the rest of the teams taking part @ DreamHack London, and we actually don't believe that their game against Renegades will go any better than the previous one against Envy, where they lost 16-2. Betting odds are obviously skewed in favor of the Aussies, and we agree on this trend, even if the percentages are currently in no way rewarding. So the only obvious options are going for a skip and move on, or pick an High bet on Renegades and attempt to win a couple of Bizons.
http://csgo.guru/match/1982!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5657!$Dignitas!$ES!$Dignitas!$0.7!$0.86!$-0.16000000000000003!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This is for sure a quite unexpected match-up. Looks-like that EZskins raised their heads a bit right after the Thooorin's jokes. Theres no question Renegades are surely decent, but we need to say that they don't practice on a frequent basis against EU teams, so their pattern can always be a bit unpredictable and the shifts from extreme promise towards failure pretty quickly. Anyways, Dignitas are surely favored here, and are a way more solidified team compared to the Aussies, so they shouldn't face any real issue in rolling over the British side. Our pick is a Low/Avg bet on Dignitas.
http://csgo.guru/match/1984!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5663!$TSM!$G2!$TSM!$0.6!$0.74!$-0.14!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) is about to faceoff with G2 (Former Kinguin, Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7). This is sure be to a very interesting match up. Players to keep an eye on for TSM are CajunB and Karrigan. If they can keep their game at a higher level the rest of the pieces will fall into place. As for G2, we will need Rain and Fox to be up to par as Scream and company come banging at TSM's door looking for that upset victory. TSM are among the top 5 Teams in the world, and a good candidate for the final victory, making them one of the teams to beat. In general, they have been extremely consistent in their LAN performances, but they have had some difficulties in their last few Online matches, so we shall see if G2 is up to task. With the current CSGL odds being so skewed, we are suggesting an ICB on G2 in hopes that they'll be firing on all cyclinders and pull it together to upset TSM.

To this point, both teams have played quite acceptably, but obviously we don't yet have many matches to reference in evaluating CPH Wolves (Tier3, Form: 55.0). But from what they have shown, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them put up a good fight (and for sure the Bo1 format will help them a bit). Between these two teams, Gamers2 (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 64.74) are without a doubt the more experienced a more cohesive group. With this clear advantage, we're orietend to picking them for an Avg bet. However, considering the higher chance of seeing a close match, we do suggest avoiding too high values (in particular if we see a new map).
http://csgo.guru/match/1987!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5672!$Dignitas!$TSM!$TSM!$0.35!$0.09!$0.26!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Honestly not much to say. Betting odds already turned into 90/10, and both the Semis are far from being profitable, since we're talking about a couple of Bo3 games featuring quite low upset chances. Talking about the match it self, TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) yesterday easily moved over G2 and CPH Wolves, and we doubt we'll watch them having more issues in dealing with Dignitas, obviously we're talking about a local derby (both lineups are Danish, Schneider excluded) and dynamics are a bit different compared to International matches, but TSM always played pretty fine on the extended map-pool and we doubt we'll watch Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) taking more than a map (but we'll probably watch just a plain 2-0). About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph we'll see: de_mirage, de_overpass and de_train. If it goes so, TSM should be able to grab both Mirage and Overpass, while Train could be slightly more balanced. Our pick is TSM; but due the extremely low profitability you should seriously evaluate a skip.
http://csgo.guru/match/1988!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5674!$EnVyUs!$CW!$EnVyUs!$0.65!$0.93!$-0.28!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Again a match affected by extremely skewed Betting odds, just like the previous one, we're talking about a game featuring a quite interesting eSport-ive value, but not really suitable for gambling. EnvyUs (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8), just like TSM, didn't face any issue in topping their respective group. Both matches they played finished without surprises. On the other hand, the team who took the scene by storm are CPH Wolves (Tier3, Form: 55.0). On our end, we were well aware of their potential, but what they managed to achieve against Gamers2 was certainly something nobody was expecting. As we stated in our post-game tweet too, we really enjoyed their approach to these matches. They slightly resemble the 1st generation LGB roster, and their gameplay is quite enjoyable to watch too. Obviously the Bo3 format is in favor of Envy, and we highly doubt we'll watch CPH Wolves advance to the final. Unfortunately Betting Odds are just terrible, so even though we believe we'll watch Envy taking this, we can't really suggest to bet on 90/10 percentages. Internally we'll probably try a super #yolo ICB on CPH Wolves, just to add some pepper to the salad, but we highly doubt we'll watch our Bizons coming back.

Neither team encountered much opposition along the way, so it should make for truly entertaining and welcomed showdown between two of the best teams in the world. EnvyUs (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8) advanced here after quickly dispatching the up-and-coming CPHW in a two game sweep, lead by a stellar performances from NBK and apEX. So they surely seem to be in form. Meanwhile TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) also swept their way past Dignitas, but nearly found themselves needing the 3rd map in their bo3 to advance. But otherwise thier road here has been relatively issue-free. It is worth noting that TSM are going to need more from Karrigan if they hope to matchup with NV. As for the maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, there is a high probability to watch de_dust, de_inferno and de_train. If that is how the veto plays out, Dust2 may go to TSM, while Envy should have the advantage on Inferno. Leaving Train, which can easily go both ways. Current odds favor NV, but we feel this is more likely a 50/50 tossup, sure to require the 3rd deciding map. Since the odds wont benefit much from an NV pick, we're slightly oriented towards a low bet on TSM to take the prize.

Despite the closely fought de_cbble match, which hasn't been very consistent in NA, the result wasn't at all expected. Going into the match, overall, Orgless hadn't been performing that well, meanwhile coL were consistently putting up strong fights against most of the top-5 NA teams. But now we're talking about a CEVO Bo2, so the risk of an upset is slightly lower. Plus we don't believe we'll watch coL lose two maps in a row. (They could stumble a bit on a new map, but we highly doubt we'll see 2 new maps on this match). Betting odds are currently trending in favor of coL, and we agree with this. So our pick is a Low bet on coL.

Both teams just played against each other yesterday in CEVO where coL managed to grab a fair and square 2-0 victory. However, here they face off in just a Bo1, so the chance of upset is slightly higher, in particular if Coast can force coL to a new map. But this is an extremely unlikely occurrance, and we do believe compLexity learned their lesson (they lost 16-14 to Coast about a week ago on de_cbble). Betting odds are currently trending in favor of coL, and we agree on this, so even if the percentages aren't too amazing our pick is an avg bet on coL.

For sure they provided a good show during the online Qualifier, but we need to remember that they mostly faced T2-3 teams, and they've also been a bit lucky in the process. On the other hand Cloud9 (Ranked 7th in Tier1, Form: 67.2) stopped shining as they were doing during mid-summer, but they are still a quite solid and organized team, so we don't believe we'll watch them losing more than a map against Roccat. Our pick is obviously C9, but the Betting odds are pretty terrible, so you can skip without regrets.

Immunity (Tier3, Form: 51.7) obviously are a bit of a question mark, since they can't face Euro teams on a consistent basis due their location. However in their previous shows they always provided performances in line with the Tier3, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a decent fight against Dignitas, even if the chances of watching them taking the whole Bo3 are quite low. On the ther hand Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) are obviously favored, they are part of the four top-ranked Tier2 teams looking for a Tier1 spot, and even if lately they stepped back a bit they are still pretty capable to deal with most of the T2-3 teams around. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Dignitas, and even if we agree on this trend, unfortunately the percentages are quite terrible and nowhere profitable. So we're a bit more oriented in attempting a #yolo ICB on Immunity just in order to add some pepper into the salad (but the chances for it to pay off are pretty low).

CPH Wolves (Tier3, Form: 55.0) displayed really good things during DreamHack London last week, at our end we truly believe that this roster can actually find a consistent place within the scene, and on the long term (maybe) achieve something decent too. Their playstyle is quite similar to the one used by the 1st gen LGB roster, and this makes them pretty enjoyable to watch and quite nasty to face in Bo1 games. Obviously here we're talking about a Bo3 and Fsid3 (Ranked 5th in Tier2, Form: 56.6) are a pretty well organized team (even if they still lack a bit in firepower, but we pointed out this issue plenty of times already), but overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch a close game and a pretty entertaining one too. About maps, we believe we'll watch something similar to : de_overpass, de_mirage and de_dust2 (or de_cbble). If the veto goes so, CPHW should be advantaged on Mirage, while Fsid3 will likely grab Overpass and Dust2 will be mostly a coin-toss. Betting odds are trending in favor of Fsid3, but this is a pure 50/50 game so our pick is a Low bet on CPH Wolves (due the more rewarding percentages).

It will be a BO3 and most likely a match where we will see all 3 maps played. We will watch two quite inconsistent teams try to pull out a victory they are missing since a long time in International Lan matches. CLG (Ranked 6th in Tier2, Form: 57.3) are trying to work out of the slump they have been in. Sure, they've accumulated some victories lately, but not against any top tier competition, and overall they need to figure out their issues if they want to be where they were 3 weeks ago. D&amp;G (now CSGL)(Tier3, Form 55.6) on the other hand, are very inconsistent and basically have Mirage and Cache as the only maps they can count on. Being so limited, they haven't found much consistency on other maps. As for maps, we do expect to this match go to require the third, and to see these two teams working on much of their game and team mechanics. The maps selected should be: de_overpass, de_mirage and de_train. Betting odds are currently at 70/30 and we believe there is still room for an AVG bet on CLG, but if Odds get any higher (around 80/20) we suggest to go for an ICB on CSGL.

For sure a quite interesting one, since TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) are just back from DreamHack London, where they finished 2nd. Honestly they didn't play bad at all @ DHL, and their performance was perfectly in-line with the current positive trend we observed during Dubai Invitational too. What happened in London is mostly a stellar performance at the EnvyUs side, and we're calling it so because some of that personal plays (such as the Happy's Deagle ace) are simply unrepeatable, obviously they'll be part of the CS:GO history, but you can't expect them to happen on a regular pattern. On the other hand NaVi (Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1) are in a slump since a while, @ Dubai they didn't impress at all, and in their latest online games they mostly faced T2-3 teams. Additionally during the last week they also took a short break, so they aren't moving here in their best form. Talking about the map, in the short-term TSM never played de_train in a good way, while NaVi showed slightly better things, however we're a bit more concerned about the NaVi's low form rather than the TSM strats-related issues. Betting odds are trending in favor of TSM; and we agree on this, but we wouldn't be surprised to watch a match closer than expected, so our pick is TSM but we don't suggest to go for values higher than Low.
http://csgo.guru/match/2009!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5707!$Na'Vi!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.2!$0.2!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$This game is the perfect example of the volatility of the CS:GO scene, here we've a Tier1 team, NaVi (Ranked 6th in Tier1, Form: 66.1) that currently is sporting Betting Odds equivalent to the ones of a Tier2 team. This is pretty absurd, since NaVi are for sure in a slump, but still fully capable to put up a challenge against Fnatic, in particular in a Bo1 game and on a map such as de_cbble, where they always managed to show decent things. Counter-Strike isn't a black/white game, even if several 'analysts' like picturing it so, the grey zone is pretty wide and the upset are quite frequent as well, in particular when talking about teams sporting a lot of talents. So, Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) are obviously favored, but real-world odds are just 60/40 in their favor, so our pick is an ICB on NaVi in order to take advantage of the skewed percentages.

However, despite the Dubai Bo1 mess, we need to remember that Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) are still the top-1 in the world and the team to beat, so real-world odds are obviously a bit in their favor, even if we're talking about a map quite prone to upsets. Betting odds are skewed in favor of Fnatic, but honestly here the way to go is a Low bet on NiP, in order to take advantage of their strong momentum, and because Dust2 is one of the very few maps where Fnatic never excelled at (they are still pretty good though).

This game is taking place on de_train, a map where NiP always managed to achieve pretty good results and close scores against most of the Tier1 teams around, while TSM in the short-term didn't look too fine on it and recently they started vetoing it on a consistent basis. Despite we're talking about a quite even match, we're more oriented in going for a Low bet on NiP, since their timings and strats are usually way more reliable (on Train) than the TSM ones.

Gamers2 (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) are moving here after a terrible show @ DreamHack London, where they've been sent home early due a double loss against TSM and (surprisingly) versus CPH Wolves. Honestly they're still in high seas and their success at Gaming Paradise looks like a lucky episode rather than a real trend. On the other hand, Penta about a week ago refreshed their roster with the additions of Spiidi (who did pretty well with Mouz) and Tahsin, so on the medium-term we'll likely watch the German side improving a bit compared to the disappointing performances they collected in the past months. Betting odds are obviously in favor of G2, and we agree on this trend since we doubt we'll watch them losing both maps, so our pick is an Avg bet on Gamers2.
http://csgo.guru/match/2015!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5719!$Cloud9!$Dignitas!$Cloud9!$0.6!$0.67!$-0.07000000000000006!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the Group A upper-bracket Final, so the winner of this match will directly move to the next Major (DreamHack Cluj-Napoca). Both teams moved through their first game in a pretty easy fashion, but we need to say that they didn't face any scary opponent at all, and they are still favored for taking both the available spots. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_inferno, de_cache and de_cbble. If the veto will follow this pattern, C9 (Ranked 7th in Tier1, Form: 67.2) should be advantaged on both Cobblestone and Cache, while Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) may take Inferno. Our pick is an Average bet on Cloud9, since we believe they're a bit better on the extended map-pool.
http://csgo.guru/match/2016!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5720!$ROCCAT!$Imm!$Imm!$0.55!$0.61!$-0.05999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not a bad Tier3 show, both teams should be around the same level, with Immunity featuring a more glued and solid teamplay, while on the other hand Roccat are sporting an higher firepower and more experienced players. Overall this is a pretty risky game, and guessing the maps (despite the Bo3 format) isn't really possible due the fact that Roccat is basically a mix and Immunity didn't play enough International matches to configure a proper pattern. According to what we watched so far, we're oriented in giving a little edge to the Finnish side (Roccat), due the close match they managed to put up versus Cloud9, so they're our pick, but we don't suggest to go with values above Low due the many question marks.
http://csgo.guru/match/2038!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5724!$G2!$E-Frag!$G2!$0.55!$0.56!$-0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy match to predict since Scream just left Gamers2 and we don't know who will fill his spot yet (but according to the past stand-ins, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a NiP player). Overall we don't believe that the moral is extremely high within G2 (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7), and honestly we're not so sure we'll watch them sticking together in the future. On the other hand Efrag have a good chance for setting up an upset, or at least provide a good show (since we don't think we'll watch them winning two maps in a row) even if lately they lost a bit their momentum. Betting odds are still skewed in favor of G2, despite the departure of Scream, and this is kinda understandable since they always managed to bring-in top-tier stand-ins. Since here we're talking about a Bo2 we kinda doubt we'll watch G2 losing twice, so we're oriented in going Low on them despite the TBA sub.
http://csgo.guru/match/2040!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5741!$FSid3!$CLG!$CLG!$0.45!$0.65!$-0.2!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The previous match just finished and the current one will start next, so we've just few mins to cover it, and then we must be shorter than usual. About CLG, we're kinda impressed by them since they managed to comeback from a pretty messy situation, by battling pretty hard on maps where usually Euro teams are advantaged, so looks like they moved here a bit more in form compared to what they displayed locally. About Fsid3, honestly we were expecting them in troubles against CPH Wolves, but instead they managed to put up a brilliant performance, and overall are looking quite fine. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Fsid3, but real-world percentages are more aligned to the middle, so our pick is a Low bet on CLG.
http://csgo.guru/match/2041!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5742!$CW!$CSGL!$CW!$0.45!$0.44!$0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty even match-up, both teams looked pretty inconsistent today, CPH Wolves (Tier3, Form: 55.0) failed to setup a real challenge against Fsid3, and they played a pretty embarrassing first map. While on the other hand, CSGL (Tier3, Form 55.6) ended into a fluke, and after a start with the pedal to the metal they tilted pretty hard, failing to show the focus needed to grab an important game like their one against CLG. Overall we're pretty sure we'll watch a quite weird veto and we wouldn't be surprised to watch a pattern heavily based on the new maps. Betting odds are still moving a lot, but they'll probably stop around the middle, and honestly this is kinda fine since we're talking about an extremely risky game. At our end we're a bit more oriented in going Low on CPH Wolves mostly because CSGL looked way too messy in the late game management.
http://csgo.guru/match/2044!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5738!$LG!$coL!$LG!$0.6!$0.81!$-0.21000000000000008!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$The best North American match we have to forward to tonight. Luminosity are coming into this match riding quite a hot streak, which followed a couple of weeks of instability, so they do appear to have turned it around. On the other hand coL has undoubtedly shown promise, however their performances have still been inconsistent. Althoug they too are entering this match on a similar positive streak while playing some pretty top-notch CS, they still have a bad habit of losing focus randomly mid-match. And so they sometimes end up fighting through some far closer matches than expected and they take more risks than they should. However here we're talking again about a CEVO Bo2, and overall we highly doubt we'll watch the Brazilian side losing two maps in a row, even if they're fully capable of losing one and going for a Tie. Generally we feel its safer going Avg on Luminosity rather than gambling on coL.
http://csgo.guru/match/2046!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5737!$Method!$Coast!$Method!$0.5!$0.66!$-0.16000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty balanced low-tier CEVO match. Recently neither team has provided any any amazing perfomances. Coast are probably a bit better "on paper," since they sport a generally strong lineup, but Method are a slightly more glued and their strats are usually more logical. These kind of Bo2s are quite prone to end in a Tie, however we need to note that right now Betting Odds are heavily skewed in favor of Method, and this is a bit unusual since both teams aren't really swimming in safe waters, so at our end we're a bit more oriented in going for an ICB/Low bet on Coast rather than risking an average value on Method.
http://csgo.guru/match/2047!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5743!$TSM!$VP!$TSM!$0.5!$0.53!$-0.030000000000000027!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the first match for VirtusPro (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) after their beautiful victory @ Dubai Invitational, and honestly not really a soft game for coming back in business after some days off, since TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) are already back since a while and they're probably looking forward to a victory in order to take their revenge. While there isn't much to say about VP, since they simply played without scratches in the past month, there is more to say about TSM since they also managed to grab a 2nd place few days ago in London. Overall the Danish side is following a precise (but a bit slow) path of improvement, and actually even if they don't play in a super-entertaining way, they always manage to put up good fights and move to the final stages of every cup they take part. Talking about the current match, this is a quite important one since it's the CounterPit consolidation Final, and the winner of this game will move on in the Grand Final against EnvyUs. According to our Veto Pattern graph, we believe we'll watch : de_overpass, de_train and de_mirage as maps. If it goes so, VP should be a bit better on Train, while TSM will likely grab Overpass and Mirage can easily go both ways. Despite we're really impressed by what VP managed to achieve, we're a bit more oriented in going Low on TSM, mostly because they're back since a longer time and also in London they looked pretty solid (ofc they lost the Grand Final, but that happened just because Envy decided to go stellar). Additionally the Betting odds are currently way too skewed, while real-world ones are more around 50/50.
http://csgo.guru/match/2048!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5748!$mouz!$WinterFox!$mouz!$0.55!$0.88!$-0.32999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Not an obvious match as may look at first sight. Winterfox (former Mythic) are widely undervalued, but honestly this is a mistake, they are the only EU-NA mix around and their playstyle is quite unique, actually they aren't extremely consistent on the extended map-pool but skill-wise they should be capable to offer a good show. On the other hand, Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) experienced a couple of not so satisfying weeks, but overall they're still in the poker of Tier2 teams looking for a Tier1 spot, and in the past few days they also woke up a bit. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass. If the veto will go so, Mouz should be advantaged on Cobblestone, while both Dust2 and Overpass can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently pretty off and not really profitable for a bet on Mouz, so we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB on Winterfox.
http://csgo.guru/match/2049!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5744!$Renegades!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.4!$0.34!$0.06!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$According to the level displayed by Liquid (Ranked 10th in Tier2, Form: 60.7) in the short-term we highly doubt we'll watch them suffering too much against Renegades, and actually these Betting odds aren't bad at all for going with the North American side. Since when Hiko moved 'officially' to Liquid, we watched them improving their performances day after day, and if we compare their current Form with the rest of the top-tier NA teams, we can easily position them in 2nd place right below Cloud9. About Renegades (Ranked 9th in Tier2, Form: 58.4), honestly we were expecting a bit more from them @ DreamHack London, in particular after their first match against Titan where they displayed pretty good things, unfortunately they didn't manage to keep that level, and their unexpected loss against EzSkins sent them to packing early. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_dust2 and de_mirage. If the veto will go so, Liquid should be better on both Dust2 and Cache, while Mirage may go to the Aussies. Our pick is an Average bet on Liquid, since we've faith in their recently regained form.
http://csgo.guru/match/2052!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5754!$E-Frag!$SK!$E-Frag!$0.45!$0.67!$-0.22000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty low-tier Bo2, both teams are in a slump since a while, in particular SK after a pretty decent mid-summer are struggling on a daily basis against most of the other Tier2-3 teams, and even their recent lineup-changes didn't manage to fix the issues yet. On the other hand EFrag are following a quite similar pattern, and honestly there are good chances for them to move to Tier3 soon, since their performances aren't really on par with the rest of the T2 group. About maps there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto goes so, SK should be a bit better on both Overpass and Train, while Efrag should be able to grab Mirage. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor of EFrag, and this is a bit weird since this trend is based on when both teams were doing decently, so today we're mostly talking about a quite even match and then we're more oriented in going Low on SK.
http://csgo.guru/match/2053!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5760!$mouz!$Liquid!$mouz!$0.5!$0.64!$-0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The 2nd group-stage match is just finished, so we're moving straight into the subsequent match with just few mins available due to the pretty tight schedule. Both the previous games were pretty close, and we always the Overtimes as well. Honestly this is basically a pure 50/50 game. Betting odds are actually still changing a lot, but we believe they'll trend in favor of Mouz, mostly because they're plain 2-0 victory over Winterfox and because most of the people generally have more faith in EU teams rather than NA teams. As we stated in the entry line, we believe that this game can easily go either way, in particular because both teams share an extremely similar Veto Patterns. Thus we expect to see a balanced selection such as : de_dust2, de_cache and de_overpass (or de_train). Our pick is a Low bet on Liquid, mostly in order to take advantage of the more rewarding odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/2054!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5761!$WinterFox!$Renegades!$Renegades!$0.55!$0.36!$0.19000000000000006!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Actually quite the interesting match here. Despite the outcome both teams looked pretty well aligned in their entry game performances. Renegades managed to take a slight advantage after a slow start on the first map vs Liquid, but then failed to keep the show on par in the following maps. Meanwhile, Winterfox, on the other hand lost 2-0. But thats a bit misleading as they put forth a decent fight in both maps including the forced OT and overall displayed some encouraging things. About maps, chances are we'll watch : de_cache, de_overpass and de_inferno. If it goes this way, Cache will likely go to Renegades, while Inferno may go to Winterfox, and Overpass is going to be pretty random. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Renegades, mostly because they managed to take a map from Liquid than anything else, but honestly this is still a pretty even game. We're oriented in going Low on Winterfox since we believe they're slightly more solid on the extended map pool due to the EU composition.
http://csgo.guru/match/2057!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5749!$coL!$NME!$NME!$0.6!$0.73!$-0.13!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Always a decent matchup when these two NA Teir 3 teams square off. coL is coming off a tough 0-2 game to LG where coL found little by way of success. Before that their matches have been mostly inconsistent. Needless to say, they hope to turn it around with a much needed win, and will likely refer to their previous match against Enemy to help their confidence. Opposite them, a promising Enemy squad, who seems to improve a little with each match while playing an intrestingly fast-paced CS. They'll hope to use this to their advantage in this bo1, cause they're in even greater need of stringing together some victories. When two teams enter a match with some level of desperation, we're usually optimistic of watching a tightly fought match, simultaneously raising the betting risk. We feel coL's skillset awards the advantage, making them our pick. Odds however more greatly favor coL, so an average bet is needed to make it worth while
http://csgo.guru/match/2058!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5751!$LG!$3sUP!$LG!$0.75!$0.8!$-0.050000000000000044!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Not much to say since Betting odds are already pretty skewed in favor of Luminosity. Honestly we doubt we'll watch LG failing this game and the only possibility to see a closer than expected map if we see a sided map such as de_train. But this is unlikely according to the Veto patterns of the two teams involved. Overall we're not talking about an extremely profitable game, but should be moreso a safe one. So we're confident in picking an Avg/High bet on Luminosity, and the risk should be kinda low.
http://csgo.guru/match/2059!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5752!$Conquest!$Coast!$Conquest!$0.6!$0.84!$-0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Again not a great game for betting, since the odds are basically 90/10 in favor of Conquest. Lately they've impressed while looking to be in full form. Coast aren't too bad either, and they are certainly a bit better compared to the wide range of low-tier North American teams floating around. However, they actually lack of the firepower needed to take down most of the top-5 NA teams. This is a CEVO game, so they'll play a Bo2, but actually we highly doubt Conquest will lose 2 maps in a row, but do feel Coast may be able to force them to a Tie. But any chances for a full upset are remote. Just like the previous match, Betting odds are pretty bad, so even though Conquest are heavily favored (they're our pick too) we don't think that going with them is profitable enough to act on, so you can probably skip without regrets.
http://csgo.guru/match/2061!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5763!$Vexed!$HR!$HR!$0.4!$0.17!$0.23!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Kicking off the 4th day of qualifying matches for DH Stockholm, we have Vexed (formerly e-bettle) (Tier3, Form: 56.1) coming into this round desperately seeking to bounce back from a number of defeats. However, they're going to have their hands full with more talented HellRaisers (Ranked 1st in Tier2, Form: 64.6.) Theres no question HR is bigger contender here, as they push to make their way into Tier 1 after recently adding S1mple to their new lineup, and hope to see Stockholm host this progression. But first they'll have to dispatch a desperate and shaky Vexed. Following the veto, we expect to see de_cbble, de_dust2, and de_train. HR will grab Cobble, and Vexed will be most competitive on Dust2, and if the 3rd map is necessary, HR will look to close there. Odds are expected skewed heavily in favor of HR, but Vexed has historically put up a decent fight against Tier 2 teams, and we believe this pattern raising the risk some for this matchup. So we suggest keeping your bet low on HR.
http://csgo.guru/match/2070!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5762!$Titan!$SR!$Titan!$0.9!$0.95!$-0.04999999999999993!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$REALLY not much to say on this match. Advancing to the Upper Bracket requires this match mostly as a formality for Titan who have kinda-cemented their position in Teir 1 for some time. So they'll likely use this match as a warmup practice for their subsequent match against the winner of Vexed/HR. This will be also the first offline match featuring ScreaM wearing again the Titan shirt, after his departure from Gamers2. Skyred on the other hand, will gladly take the media exposure awarded them from this DH appearance, and hope to catch Titan underestimating them to their detriment. But even then, they too will look forward to the outcome of Vexed/HR, in hopes of stretching their DH visit another day. With this match, the map pool really wont have much bearing on the outcome, likewise a bet here would yeild so little gain we suggest to skip and makes plans for your skins on another match.

Vexed (ex-eBettle) are looking to try and knock out the Vietnamese team of Skyred and advance for their chance to go to Cluj-Napoca. Skyred was easily put on tilt by Titan earlier. But honestly they didn't too bad if we consider that it was their first International match, however Vexed shouldn't experience any real issue in rolling over them in a Bo3 game, and we don't expect any real surprise. With the current Betting odds getting out of hand the only way to profit here would be to go for an High bet on Vexed, but honestly percentages aren't really great and a skip is an option too.
http://csgo.guru/match/2074!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5767!$Dignitas!$Imm!$Dignitas!$0.65!$0.89!$-0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Here we are after four long days of qualifying matches, the consolidation round kicks off with a Day 1 Group A rematch. Except this match offers no chance of redemption this time around. Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) landed themselves in this elimination match after being dispatched rather easily by C9 in the upper bracket final, while Immunity (Tier3, Form: 51.7) earned its second life when eliminating Roccat. On paper, this is an interesting matchup, but in their previous meeting Dignitas make quick work of the lowered tiered opponent. But after sitting with a sour taste for 3 days since C9, we are sure to see Dignitas try to set the pace early. However, IMTY likely had a looser several day wait for this match coming off a win. This clash of momentum may make it a little more interesting, with a slight possibility of seeing the 3rd map. Quite honestly though, we expect much of the same as their previous matchup with Dignitas putting on a show for the live audience . The Veto will probably go, de_cache, de_inferno, and de_mirage. If IMTY gets some luck in their favor, they may take inferno to force the third, but cache and mirage are sure to go to Dignitas. Betting odds are skewed mightily in favor Dignitas of course, which we dont "fully" agree, but avg an bet would still be reasonable. Keep in mind IMTY went out with dignity last time, so bet wisely.

Additionally we're looking at a Bo5, which is quite an unusual format for games other than a Grand Final. No question the extended map-pool is providing a greater advantage to Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08)who are obviously one the most consistent teams out there. In particular, they sport a roster with very few flaws, basically free of maps where they perform under the Top4 level. On the other hand NiP (Ranked 5th in Tier1, Form: 69.0) seemed to have waken up recently and are really coming to form. Switching coaches helped for sure and having Heaton back appears to improved their motivation marginally. However, the lineup related rumors surrounding the team are not a good sign, and may play a role in creating a high pressure situation that could prove detrimental. As for the match itself, since we're talking about a Bo5, we believe we'll watch de_overpass and de_cache vetoed off. Fnatic should be overall a bit more consistent on the remaining pool of maps. However, it's important we note that Betting odds are currently pretty crazy, and with the NiP's percentagey sitting below 20% we have little to no doubt about dropping an ICB, in order to take advantage of the skewed odds. As stated Fnatic have a slight advantage, but with these odds we simply can't go with them. And honestly, we're talking about a couple of teams with all-star rosters, that can easily shift the trend of a match their way. Depending on how they woke in the morning, we can have a chess match, or an all out war. So we suggest to be extremely cautious and avoid too greedy a bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/2076!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5769!$FSid3!$CW!$FSid3!$0.55!$0.73!$-0.17999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Another interesting match where both teams had already faced each other in their entry game, in which Fsid3 (Ranked 5th in Tier2, Form: 56.6)managed to win in quite convincingly fashion (with reference to the 16-1 win on de_train). CPH Wolves, however rebounded well with a surprising triumph over CSGL (former D&amp;G) in a very tight Bo3. As we stated several times already, we actually believe that CPH Wolves (Tier3, Form: 55.0) have made great strides of improvment, game after game, showing serious potential of developoing into a regular contender against the top ranked Tier2 teams. On the other hand, Fsid3 are moving here with boosted confidence from their first match, and are for sure sporting a more experienced and slightly more glued lineup compared to CPH Wolves. Overall, they should be a bit better on the extended map-pool. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph we believe we'll watch : de_mirage, de_overpass and de_cache. If the veto goes as so, we might experience a slightly closer game than the previous game. Both Mirage and Cache can easily go both ways and Overpass should be Flipsid3's advantage. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Fsid3, and despite our general agreement, we don't believe that the current percentages are correct. We wouldn't be surprised to watch CPH Wolves playing even more polished than before (in particular if they manage to avoid Train.) So our pick is a Low/ICB bet on the Nordic mix (CPH Wolves).
http://csgo.guru/match/2077!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5772!$VP!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.45!$0.33!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second huge match of the day presented by Gfinity. Here we get to enjoy another bo5 between VirtusPro vs EnvyUs, after a previous matchup between the two that saw the Polish side manage to send the French packing early during the Dubai Invitational Bo1 hell. As we stated several times over the past weeks, VP (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) took several days off after their Dubai triumph. During this break we believe they've lost some momentum. In their latest match 2 days ago against TSM, things didn't go well in a performance where they looked quite rusty. Obviously, here we're talking about a Lan match, and usually the Polish Beasts are famous for performing at a higher level in live events compared to online. So we're oriented in believing that they should be able to put up a good challenge. On the other hand, Envy (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8) is coming off a disappointing show @ Dubai, but finally stepped up and managed to comeback with a brilliant victory during DreamHack London last week, where they rolled over TSM and offered an amazing show. Just like NiP-Fnatic we discussed before, here we're again is a Bo5, and there are good chances to see de_dust2 and de_overpass vetoed off, while on the rest of the maps we're a bit more oriented in awarding EnvyUs a slight advantage (but still something around 55/45, nothing too relevant), but we are still very likely watch a quite tight game. Betting odds are actually overly skewed in favor of Envy, and honestly writing off VP too early is always a huge mistake. So we're oriented in picking a Low bet on the Polish side (VP).

This will be the second time in 3 days that these two teams have matched up and we will surely see another great thriller. Liquid won the first match up between these two with a scoreline of 2-1. That being said these Aussies are very resilient and quick to learn from their mistakes. Renegades will be looking to change up a map or two and will be out for blood. About the maps: We believe we will see de_cache, de_cobble, and de_dust2. We believe Liquid to be better on de_cache and they should take that along with de_dust2 and should have another 2-1 victory over the Aussies. Our pick is an Average bet on Liquid, since we've faith in their recent pretty promising trend.
http://csgo.guru/match/2080!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5773!$HR!$Vexed!$Vexed!$0.6!$0.9!$-0.30000000000000004!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not a bad low-tier match here. Both teams squared off already yesterday, in a match that saw HR easily roll over the Polish. However we need to note that these teams are coming from one of the easiest Group of the qualifiers, with Titan as the only serious contender. (Skyred surprised everybody in their losing effort, where they may have earned a little repsect, but they still weren't able to advance.) So actually we wouldn't be surprised to watch a more of an inconsistent game, additionally because Vexed (former eBettle) typically steps it up some in key matches compared to standard ones. However, HR surely has the advantage. The addition of S1mple mostly solved their common lack of firepower, and right now they have things rolling pretty well. Even their strats are looking a bit more complex and overall playing smarter compared to their past performances. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_overpass, de_cbble and de_dust2, and if the veto will go so HR should be better on both Dust2 and Cobblestone, while Overpass can easily go both ways. Our pick is an Average bet on HR, but we need to note that the current Betting odds are already pretty terrible, so an ICB on Vexed could be a good and suitable option.
http://csgo.guru/match/2082!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5775!$Fnatic!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.55!$0.71!$-0.15999999999999992!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Basically the only real game scheduled for today, and for sure one of the best matches of the year. Fnatic and EnvyUs already battled against each other during the ESL One Cologne Grand-Final, back in August, and in that occasion Fnatic managed to roll over the French side with a fair and square 2-0 score. A lot of things changed since that game, we need to remember that the French Shuffle happened a couple of weeks or so before Cologne, so Envy had pretty little time to practice with the new roster, additionally the Bo3 format relies a lot on the Veto session, while the Gfinity Champion of Champions is based on Bo5s, this means that teams need to be fine on the whole map-pool and not just on the bunch of maps they play on a daily basis. Yesterday we enjoyed a couple of crazy-tight games, and both the Semis ended only on Map 5, with NiP and VirtusPro setting up amazing fights, currently there isn't any really relevant difference between the Top5 teams, and most of the matches between the 1-5 range can easily go both ways according to the momentum or thanks to masterclass personal plays. Talking about the current game, according to our Veto Pattern graph, we believe we'll watch de_overpass and de_mirage vetoed off. On the rest of the maps, Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) should be advantaged on de_train and de_cbble; EnvyUs (Ranked 2nd in Tier1, Form: 69.8) may grab de_dust2 and de_inferno, while de_cache can easily go both ways. Overall Fnatic are historically a bit better on the extended map-pool, and the 55/45 real-world percentages are showing this, on the other hand Betting odds are currently way more skewed than our real-world ones, and honestly we don't believe that considering a match between the top-2 teams in the world as a 70/30 one is smart at all, so even if Fnatic are usually a tiny bit advantaged on this kind of long and stressing matches, we suggest to simply go for a low bet on EnvyUs in order to take advantage of the more rewarding odds (we'll enjoy a balanced game anyway).
http://csgo.guru/match/2086!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5781!$Method!$Conquest!$Conquest!$0.4!$0.18!$0.22000000000000003!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Pretty nice mid-tier North-American match. Lately Method woke up a bit and even if they're still providing quite mixed performances their teamplay actually improved slightly and overall they started looking a bit more glued &amp; focused. On the other hand Conquest slowed down a bit their run, and after a couple of weeks with the pedal to the metal, where they created huge troubles to most of the top-tier NA teams, they faced an immediate stop as soon as they've been forced on the new maps (mostly de_cbble). Talking about the current match, there are good chances to watch: de_inferno and de_train as maps. If the veto session will go so, Conquest should be fairly advantaged on both, and honestly we doubt we'll watch them losing twice in a row, so an average bet on them (Conquest) should be kinda safe and in the worst case we'll likely watch just a Tie.
http://csgo.guru/match/2088!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5799!$Vexed!$Reason!$Reason!$0.6!$0.72!$-0.12!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This is actually a pretty random match, since Reason are stepping into the game with a couple of stand-ins (Tenzki and Percy. For this reason alone, we highly doubt they'll perform too consistent, or at least consistently enough to win two maps in a row. On the other hand Vexed are just back from DreamHack Stockholm, where they surprisingly and impressively managed to qualify for the next Major after a stunning upset against Hellraisers. However it's important to remember that Vexed are quite a peculiar team, with the habit of adapting to their opponents. This (as we stated several times) can be quite an attribute when facing T2-T1 rosters, but may become counterproductive leading to below-average performances against Lower tier teams. Honestly, we doubt we'll watch Vexed lose twice in a row, so even if Betting odds aren't too great, we're oriented in going for an Average bet on them (Vexed).
http://csgo.guru/match/2095!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5790!$Norway!$Sweden!$Sweden!$0.35!$0.31!$0.03999999999999998!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Here we have a more balanced match-up compared to the previous one. Sweden (as usual) is sporting a hell of lineup, featuring some of the best players around, together with the pretty promising youngster Pauf. About the rest, Xizt is a pretty solid pick, Dennis and Maikelele work pretty well together and Pronax is one of the best IGL around. Even if this roster is missing some of the various star-players available to the Nordic country, we're still talking about a really consistent lineup. On the other hand Norway is basically fielding the entire former LGB lineup + Reasten. This is quite an interesting choice since these players are pretty used in playing together, so they should already have some great chemistry. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch them putting up a strong fight, especially with benefit of the Bo1 format. Our pick is a Low+/Avg-- bet on Sweden, but we suggest to avoid huge values due to the high risk.
http://csgo.guru/match/2105!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5788!$Germany!$Russia!$Russia!$0.4!$0.25!$0.15000000000000002!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This should be a quite interesting World Championship match to watch. Russia is moving here with the same lineup they sported in the previous game against United Kingdom, so overall looking at a pretty fine roster. On the other hand Germany is fielding players coming from three teams. Its quite an interesting mix of youngsters and experienced players, (such as Spiidi and Tabsen) so we're inclined to expect they'll jump in the game with quite an aggressive playstyle. That said, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a game closer than initially expected. Additionally, since this is a Bo1 format, (DE will likely push for a *new* map during the veto). Honestly, Russia is the better team, but we still actually feel this game pretty risky and certainly unpredictable due the composition of the German roster, so even thuough our pick is a Low+ bet on Russia, we do suggest caution with the values.
http://csgo.guru/match/2112!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5787!$UK!$Russia!$Russia!$0.3!$0.2!$0.09999999999999998!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Honestly not much to say, United Kingdom is sporting a lineup mostly based on the core players of EzSkins, however we're not talking about an especially intimitating roster. This group is probably the best lineup the country can field, but overall these players have only achieved few decent International results (at least in CS:GO.) The most recent relevant achievement is a surprise victory over Renegades during DreamHack London. On the other hand, Russia is entering the game with a pretty good lineup. Maybe this iteration lacks some fire-power since both Hooch and WorldEdit are moreso 'master-minds' rather than pure fraggers, but even still this is a team that shouldn't face any issue in rolling over the Englishmen. For sure the Bo1 format will add some element of randomness to the mix, but at our end we remain confident in picking an Avg bet on Russia.
http://csgo.guru/match/2114!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5800!$mouz!$G2!$G2!$0.5!$0.36!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the most interesting match of the day. Gamers2 just lost the services of Scream, who moved to Titan just prior to DreamHack Stockholm, so they'll play this game with a yet unknown stand-in (but we wouldn't be surprised to watch a NiP player, in our opinion Xizt) playing instead of the Belgian talent. Overall G2 still seem floating in Limbo, with their current level a bit of a question mark. On the other hand Mousesports are playing with their usual lineup, so nothing new under the sun. In the short term, they haven't performed on par with the early weeks of September and even though played exceptionally @ Dreamhack Stockholm, they weren't paired with any super-scary opponents, but overall the combination of G2+NiP could make for a hefty challenge. This is CEVO, so we're talking about a Bo2 match, and honestly we don't expect either team to take the upper hand, raising the liklihood of watching a Tie. Real-world odds are pretty well balanced, while Betting odds are more skewed in favor of Mouz. At our end we generally agree with this trend, and consider the German team a slightly more reliable, so we suggest a Low bet on them (but if you're betting on providers offering the "draw" option too, go for that).
http://csgo.guru/match/2116!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5802!$Conquest!$LG!$LG!$0.4!$0.31!$0.09000000000000002!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This match may end up being one of the more entertaining on the schedule. Luminosity is coming into this match on a bit of a hot streak, while Conquest has gone back and forth between the win and loss columns. However, in the past, LG has ran into some issues with playing the lower tier teams, including a pair of losses to Liquid. Although lately they appeared to have steadied their game. This is a Cevo match, so the bo2 format has a good chance of reaching a draw. The last time these teams met each other, as expected, it was LG who walked away the victors, but its certainly worth noting it was far from easy. LG barely escaped the 1st map 16-14, while the subsequent maps both required OT in the bo3. The two had put on an extremely wild showdown. Current odds are heavily favored towards LG, but as stated above, we're not quite expecting it to be so lopsided. Although we don't expect LG to lose twice here, there is a good chance of a tie. So we feel an average bet on LG would be suitable considering the odds, but bet wisely on this one with respect to medium risk.
http://csgo.guru/match/2117!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5803!$CLG!$NME!$CLG!$0.7!$0.93!$-0.2300000000000001!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$Not a whole lot to say about this one. A few weeks back we were optimistic about Enemy having shown us some encouraging signs, but they remain inconsistent. CLG on the other hand have been playing solid. Putting together a nice little winning streak, including their previous matchup against NME. This time around is Cevo, so obviously the bo2 will give NME 2 shots at payback and the chance to let everyone know they're another NA team to be taken seriously. Odds are skewed well into CLG's favor, and they've made that difficult to argue otherwise. They just advanced through the DH Major qualifiers in Stockholm, with some hard fought wins over CSLG and FlipSid3. But as we said before and do now, we still have faith NME has the potential, so this is a good match to consider clearing some inventory, so our pick is an ICB on NME.
http://csgo.guru/match/2119!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5810!$TSM!$EnVyUs!$TSM!$0.45!$0.35!$0.10000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$First huge match of a day filled by great top-tier games. This is the CounterPit League Grand Final, and EnvyUs are moving here with veto-advantage due coming from the upper bracket. However, history taught us that this kind of advantage is mostly irrelevant in this kind of Tier1 games, since most of the teams are quite fine on the extended map-pool. TSM in the past week didn't play too much, and excluding a couple of games (where they anyway provided quite decent results with victories over VP and NiP) we can say that they spent the last days mostly resting from DreamHack London. Talking about the previous Head 2 Heads, the DHL Grand Final didn't go too well for the Danish side, since Envy managed to setup an amazing show and sent TSM packing with a fair and square 2-0 score, thanks to several masterclass plays. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train as maps. If it goes so, Dust2 should be in advantage of Envy, while both Dust2 and Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are actually favoring EnvyUs and we agree on this trend, even if the percentages are slightly off. Our pick is a Low+ bet on Envy since we believe they feature the strongest momentum.
http://csgo.guru/match/2120!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5831!$NiP!$G2!$G2!$0.6!$0.7!$-0.09999999999999998!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Quite interesting match taking place on de_train. Yesterday Gamers2 managed to roll over Mouz in a pretty easy fashion, something we weren't expecting due the recent departure of Scream and the series of shaky results they achieved in in the short-term. However, for sure having Flusha as stand-in helped a lot, since he's currently one of the players with the highest Form of the whole scene. On the other hand NiP, a few days ago stopped their quite good winning streak and failed a couple of extremely close matches against Fnatic (but honestly this is quite understandable), in between they fell versus TSM as well (this time not really understandable) with a quite impressive score on de_train, the same map that they are going to play today against G2. For sure lately NiP didn't perform great on Train, but on the other hand G2 never played it too much or on a consistent basis, so we're more oriented in picking a Low/Avg bet on NiP due their highest experience on this map.
http://csgo.guru/match/2121!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5834!$HR!$VP!$VP!$0.3!$0.19!$0.10999999999999999!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This is a game that shouldn't reserve any huge surprise, HellRaisers are playing without S1mple (he's not allowed to play in ESL matches, Fix willplay instead), and overall they're not performing on par at all with their Q1 performances (they also managed to fail DH Cluj qualification against Vexed). On the other hand Virtus.Pro are back in biz since few days, after about 10 days off, and honestly despite a shaky entry match against TSM, they woke up a bit in Gfinity Champion of Champions where they put up an hell of a fight against EnvyUs, so their form should be quite decent again. Betting odds are currently pretty skewed in favor of VP, however we need to note that the Polish side frequently struggled on de_cbble and they never managed to find a proper way to play this map, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a final score slightly closer than expected. Our pick is an Avg bet on VP, since after-all, HR without S1mple shouldn't have enough firepower to take down Virtus.Pro.
http://csgo.guru/match/2122!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5830!$NiP!$TSM!$TSM!$0.5!$0.37!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$TSM vs NiP is always a pretty entertaining match-up, in particular when played on classic maps where both sides are frequently quite aligned. TSM are doing quite fine, in the short-term they managed to achieve two extremely relevant 2nd places at Dubai and DH London last week, but looks like the victory is still slipping from their hands, and they didn't manage to make the last little step that turns a good and consistent Tier1 team into a world-class one. On the other hand, NiP as we already stated in the previous versus Gamers2, had to deal with a couple of losses in the past week (mostly vs Fnatic), and they managed to lose against TSM too (on de_train). Talking about the current match, de_dust2 is a map that can easily go both ways, and both teams showed decent things on it, so we're oriented in considering this game as a 50/50 one, and our pick is a Low bet on NiP in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding Betting Odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/2123!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5838!$SK!$VP!$VP!$0.3!$0.16!$0.13999999999999999!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Not much to say regarding this matchup. SK has been pretty much getting beat up over the last handful of matches. Not a thrilling matchup for them at this point to say the least. To make matters worse, this ESL game drew de_Overpass, which happens to be one of the best maps for Virtus.Pro. From there, the odds tell the rest of the story. VP should have no issues dispatching SK , who also has the internal challenge of team chemistry with the rotating 5th man. Odds are skewed favoring VP, but they're still decent enough for our pick, for an average bet on Virtus.Pro.
http://csgo.guru/match/2124!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5827!$Na'Vi!$VP!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.38!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty tight match, both Virtus.Pro and Natus Vincere are quite fine on de_mirage, and used to be one of the usual picks of both teams. They already faced each other on this field during early September, during Gaming Paradise lan, and NaVi managed to take the upper hand during Overtime. However we're not oriented in considering this performance as relevant since Gaming Paradise was actually an hell, and most of the games went pretty randomly. Talking about recent results, NaVi are on a series of quite mixed results, while Virtus.Pro are for sure doing better overall, but we wouldn't be surprised to watch them paying again the days off they took prior DH London. Betting odds are currently quite even, but VP should be slightly advantaged and slightly more in Form, so our pick is a Low bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/2125!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5828!$NiP!$HR!$NiP!$0.6!$0.72!$-0.12!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This is a FaceIT game, so unlike the previous one where HellRaisers had to use Fix instead of S1mple, here they can field their official lineup. HellRaisers lately looked quite shaky, and for sure their moral cannot be too high after their loss against Vexed that negated them the qualification for the next Major. On the other hand NiP are looking quite on-point against Gamers2 (they're playing while we write), and they are moving here after an extremely tight match against Fnatic during Gfinity Champion of Champions. For sure de_dust2 is a map always open to upsets, and HR are always quite fine on it, but lately also NiP improved a lot, and actually they are one of the T1 teams performing better on it. Betting odds are skewed in favor of NiP, and we agree on this trend, percentages are currently still decent for going with an Avg bet on the Swedish side (NiP) so this is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/2126!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5826!$CSGL!$Reason!$Reason!$0.55!$0.68!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty even Tier3 game, CSGL are currently on a quite terrible streak, and as icing on the cake they failed to qualify for DH Cluj as well, due an early defeat against CPH Wolves. Honestly this doesn't come as an huge shock since they always been an inconsistent lineup, with just very few good maps and most of the others way below the average. On the other hand, yesterday Reason surprisingly managed to beat Vexed in a pretty easy fashion, and we believe that today we'll watch again the same maps: de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto will go so, CSGL should be advantaged on Mirage, while Reason will likely grab Overpass. Betting odds are pretty off, and overall this is a quite risky game, at our end we're more oriented in going Low on Reason, but if you're betting through a provider offering the "Draw" option, go for it, since the chances to watch a Tie are quite high.
http://csgo.guru/match/2127!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5841!$SK!$Titan!$Titan!$0.35!$0.15!$0.19999999999999998!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Here we are with another pretty straight forward Esl bo1 matchup. SK is coming into this match with a shaky stretch of performances, and these matchups with upper tier teams isnt doing them any favors. Nor is it helping the odds much on those respective matchups. Opposite them, Titan continues to handle their lower tier opponents with relative ease, offering them better practice than competition. And quite honestly we're not expecting much of that to change with this game. The map on hand is de_cbble which has generally been one of the stronger maps Titan. However, it is interesting the last time these two faced off on Cobblestone, SK were the ones who managed to get the upper hand early and win in relatively easy fashion. But overall that is more a rare blip on their record trend. Between that, and the fact SK has just really been struggling recently, we do not believe history will repeat itself on this map, and the favored odds will accurately reflect the Titan victory. Our pick is an average bet on Titan.
http://csgo.guru/match/2128!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5813!$FSid3!$mouz!$mouz!$0.45!$0.4!$0.04999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite nice Tier2 match-up, yesterday Mousesports surprisingly failed to put up any real fight against Gamers2, while we were expecting a way closer match, for sure Flusha playing as stand-in boosted a bit the capabilities of G2, but still, Mouz failed to offer a good show, despite the batch of maps was quite decent for them too. On the other hand FlipSid3 took few days off, and this is their first match after their successful qualification @ DreamHack Cluj (they managed to beat CPH Wolves in the deciding match). Overall they're looking quite fine and well focused, but as we stated many time already, they usually struggle a bit against teams sporting an aggressive playstyle and an high fire-power. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_overpass and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, Fsid3 should be better on Cobblestone, while Mouz will likely take Overpass. At our end we believe a bit more in Mouz, and we consider the yesterday's performance mostly as a little overlook in an overall quite consistent and convincingly series of results. Betting odds are still fine for a Low bet on Mouz, so this is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/2129!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5837!$Titan!$G2!$G2!$0.55!$0.54!$0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an obvious match as may look at first sight, Gamers2 are moving here after a surprisingly victory over NiP on de_train, for sure a quite unexpected performance since they were playing with Twist as stand-in. However here they'll play with Pyth, but the map is once again de_train, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing pretty fine again. Titan on the other hand are doing a bit better now that Scream stepped into the roster, but still they never managed to perform fine on Train, and usually they aren't any better than average on it, so with some luck G2 could be able to hit another upset. Betting odds are currently a bit skewed in favor of Titan, due the slightly better roster, but honestly we don't believe that their advantage is currently above a 5%, so we're oriented in going ICB/Low on G2, with the hope to watch again the good things they displayed against NiP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2130!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5829!$EnVyUs!$VP!$VP!$0.45!$0.52!$-0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last big match of the day, and a quite interesting one since Betting odds basically reversed after EnvyUs lost against TSM in the first game of the day (CounterPit Grand Final). Honestly we don't suggest to change bets or flag right after a single lost match, in particular if we're talking about a game played @ 17pm (== early for EU standards) where much likely Envy stepped into with too much confidence, still strong of their victory @ DH London. For sure against Virtus.Pro they'll be back on planet Earth, and hopefully a bit more focused. However we need to say that de_mirage is a VP map, they always played it in a pretty decent way, while on the other hand EnvyUs never really impressed on it, so we're oriented in considering this match as 55/45 in favor of the Polish side. Betting odds are still moving a lot, but a Low bet on VirtusPro should be fine.
http://csgo.guru/match/2196!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5845!$Coast!$LG!$LG!$0.4!$0.06!$0.34!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$One of the cevo matches being held tonight is Coast Gaming Vs. LG. This will be a BO2 match as it takes on the Cevo format. Which will most likely end in an LG 2-0 victory. Coast Gaming is made up of Canadian and US Mix of DUMORE, Stanislaw. draek, draWsoul, and inVert. They are a rather young team trying to find there way in a largly and what seems to be getting more clustered of a NA Scene. As more and more teams come on, players will continuoulsy rotate until they find a group that they mesh with and play well together. We do not see this team doing very well, but they are young and things can change. Player to watch for Coast gaming is Du Luminosity on the other hand is the Brazillian team with an American Dream. They are still on the hunt to find themselves at the top of the NA scene. As they continue to work out their kinks, you can see the improvement in both game style and sense along with strategies to help them ascend the ranks. The key player to watch for LG is coldzera. About the maps: We believe you will see de_dust2, and de_cobble. With that being said, we believe LG to be slightly better on de_dust2 and we do not expect they'll have much of an issue with Team Coast on de_cobble. As mentioned, we believe that LG should manage to take this match with a 2-0 victory as they continue to grow as a team and continue to get better, so an average bet on them is reasonable. Worst case scenerio we see this match ending in a draw, all skins returned.

Since de_mirage isn't really played on a daily basis within the North American scene, NA matches on this map are generally quite inconsistent. This match is no exception, considering both teams haven't played it more than just a handful of times throughout the past month. Overall the compLexity roster is for sure stronger than the currently composed 3sUp roster. On paper they should be able to take the upper hand, yet, we're still talking about a game that will be very likely played pug-like, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a final score slightly closer than expected. Our pick is coL, but we suggest keeping the value Low, in order to avoid a potential heart-attack during the final rounds.

Since we're talking about a CEVO Bo2, good chances are they can easily end in a draw. Method are for sure not the most consistent team out there, but we at least need to give them credit on the fact that they never give up and just keep fighting. They continue slowly improving, which is for sure a good and promising thing. 3sUp performances on the other hand are quite random. They moreso resemble a pickup team, rather than a permanent team, and its been while since they've enjoyed pleasure of victory. Honestly there is plenty of room for a Tie, but since we need to choose a side, Method are certainly looking a bit more focused, and doubt we'll watch them lose twice, especially if they manage to pick de_mirage or de_dust2.

Here we have EnvyUs and Natus Vincere battling on de_dust2. Honestly not the best map pick for NaVi, here Envy always played pretty well, and in general French teams are famous for playing D2 in a quite consistent way, on the other hand NaVi aren't too terrible at it, but still nothing exceptional for the T1 standards. Betting odds aren't bad yet, mostly because NaVi yesterday managed to play pretty well against VP (while Envy failed pretty hard versus TSM), but Dust2 is Dust2 so we're oriented in going Low+ on Envy.
http://csgo.guru/match/2206!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5859!$Fnatic!$VP!$VP!$0.55!$0.74!$-0.18999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Again de_dust2, this time we'll enjoy a pretty tight game between Virtus.Pro and Fnatic. Yesterday VP overall played decently and managed to take 3/4 of their games, however we need to say that their show on de_mirage looked quite off compared to their standard on this map, they seemed quite out of focus against NaVi, and even versus Envy they risked way too much, despite EnvyUs never played Mirage in a consistent way. However here we're talking about Dust2, one of the few maps where actually Fnatic are beatable (this is also their first match after Gfinity Champion of Champions), but unfortunately on the other hand VP never enjoyed playing it and they vetoed it plenty of times in the short-term (but for sure they improved a lot compared to Q1). Betting Odds are widely skewed in favor of the Swedish side, from a side we kinda agree on this trend and we actually believe that Fnatic will manage to win, but on the other side we can't agree on a T1 match edging the 80/20 percentages, so we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on VP rather than going High on Fnatic.

TSM yesterday managed to win CounterPit League (2-0 over EnvyUs) but they also rolled over NiP on de_dust2, and a couple of days before they won 2-0 over VP as well. So overall they're doing pretty well, and actually they're one of the T1 teams sporting the highest Form. On the other hand Gamers2 surprisingly managed to bounce back from their usual mediocrity, and actually they are performing quite well despite the random stand-ins that are filling the Scream spot. Today they'll play this game with Jkaem, who yesterday did really great against Titan on de_train (G2 won 16-2), and looks like that the Norwegian combo Rain + Jkaem works way better than expected. Betting odds are actually pretty skewed in favor of TSM, and this is quite obvious, but honestly we don't agree on betting on TSM with these percentages (75-25), since we're talking about a match taking place on de_dust2, a map quite prone to upsets and where G2 always played pretty decently, so we expect to watch a quite balanced game and our pick is an ICB on G2.

For sure Virtus.Pro always played Mirage in a quite good way, so we've been a bit surprised to watch a so close score against EnvyUs (that are quite used in banning Mirage), and we've been even more surprised to watch NaVi rolling over VP in a so easy fashion (in the previous game, again on Mirage). So overall we're prone in believing that VP didn't invest much time on this map in the short term, but at least the couple of games they played yesterday should've woke them up a bit. However, Betting odds are actually pretty balanced, so despite Envy didn't play bad yesterday we're more oriented in sticking with a Low bet on VP, with the hope to watch them a bit more focused than in the previous games.
http://csgo.guru/match/2209!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5873!$Titan!$VP!$Titan!$0.45!$0.39!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy game as may look at first sight. Virtus.Pro overall are for sure doing pretty well, but they never excelled on de_inferno, and in particular they ended in vetoing this map plenty of times in the short-term. This is for sure one of the classic maps (together with D2) where the Polish side isn't really on par with the rest of Tier1 teams. On the other hand Titan are moving here after a terrible show on de_train, where they've been schooled by G2, but this isn't really relevant since the French mix is running in a pretty inconsistent way since a while, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them bouncing back in this game, since they always played de_inferno in a quite good way. Betting odds are trending in favor of VP, but we're more prone in trying our luck with a Low bet on Titan, with the hope to watch them a bit more on-point than yesterday.

EnvyUs are for sure advantaged on de_cbble, and we don't believe we'll watch them facing too many issues against HellRaisers, unfortunately the percentages are already quite off, and there is no point in going High on the French side for basically no reward. On the other hand the chances to watch HR pulling an upset aren't really high, so we're more oriented in calling a Skip. But if you like #yolo bets, feel free to throw a couple of bizons on S1mple and friends.

Historically Virtus.Pro always been quite on-point on de_cache, their performances @ Dubai on this map were just unbelievably good, unfortunately they didn't manage to keep the following shows on par, and @ Gfinity Champion of Champions, they played it in a pretty anonymous way. However, on the other hand TSM, despite the currently strong momentum, never impressed too much on de_cache, for sure they know how to play it, but they are far from being amazing and their executions are quite average. For sure yesterday they played pretty great against EnvyUs, but honestly Envy didn't offer a good fight at all. Betting odds are trending in favor of TSM mostly because their latest results, but underestimating VP on one of their strongest maps is a plain mistake, so our pick is a Low bet on VirtusPro.

Titan few days ago switched Maniac with Scream, so probably their potential is slightly higher than before, but we doubt that this switch solved the late-game issues they were experiencing as well. Anyway, since here we're talking about a Bo1, we're a bit more confident in the French side compared to matches based on the extended map-pool. On the other hand, Dignitas didn't play too much in the short-term, but usually they are quite decent on Cobblestone, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them offering a good fight. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Titan, and we kinda agree on this, since objectively they are a bit better than Dignitas on this map. Our pick is Titan, but we don't suggest to go with values above Low due the very high risk.

HR are moving here on a pretty terrible streak, and honestly they are looking quite off on a wide range of the extended map-pool, here they are playing on de_overpass, a map where they lost against Vexed @ DH Stockholm, and that caused them to do not qualify for the next Major. Titan are usually a bit more prone in playing de_cbble compared to de_mirage, but usually they are quite decent at it a well, plenty of times they have been unlucky in the late game and in OTs, but honestly their gameplay was quite ok, so we expect them to play decently. Betting odds are somehow in favor of HellRaisers, mostly because they managed to win their latest H2H against Titan on this map, but at our end we don't consider that single result as extremely relevant, so our pick is a Low bet on Titan.
http://csgo.guru/match/2214!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5878!$CSGL!$FSid3!$FSid3!$0.45!$0.29!$0.16000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty risky game, both teams aren't rolling too well in the short term. In particular CSGL are on a quite terrible streak, and they failed to put any decent fight across the past 2 weeks, as icing on the cake they even failed to qualify for DH Cluj. On the other hand FlipSid3 are doing a bit better, they are a quite solid lineup, but as we stated many times already they usually face some issues against overly aggressive opponents, additionally they have the habit to repeat endlessly the same couple of executions, so they are a bit predictable on the long run. Here we're talking a Bo3, and we believe we'll watch : de_mirage, de_overpass and de_cbble as maps. If the veto will go so, Fsid3 should be advantaged on Cobblestone, while Mirage will likely go to CSGL and Overpass can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of Fsid3, while we're mostly talking about a quite balanced game, overall we don't feel fine in going Avg on FlipSid3 even if we believe they're slightly advantaged, so we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on CSGL.

Overall the Danish side looked quite on point, but the few days of break they took right after the event may have influenced a bit their momentum, so despite they're are for sure one of the Tier2 teams performing better, they may face some issues on the first map (we're talking about a CEVO Bo2). On the other hand Mousesports are back since a slightly longer time, they qualified to DH Cluj in a pretty easy fashion by rolling over the two American sides (Liquid &amp; WinterFox) and after a shaky first game against G2, yesterday they provided a solid show against Fsid3. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph, we believe we'll watch : de_mirage and de_cache. If it goes so, Dignitas may grab Mirage, while Mouz should be advantaged on Cache. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of Mouz, but honestly this is a pure 50/50 game featuring a pretty high chance to watch a Tie, so we're more oriented in going Low on Dignitas in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2216!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5843!$Penta!$HR!$null!$0.4!$0.25!$0.15000000000000002!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Early CEVO Bo2, and a quite decent Tier2 match-up. Penta aren't doing too bad since they refreshed their roster, and for sure the latest iteration of the team is looking way more promising than the previous lineup, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them hitting the Tier2 on the long run. On the other hand HellRaisers are still quite shaky, despite the surely important addition of S1mple, they're still struggling in finding their place, and the past few matches together with the early elimination @ DH Stockholm aren't shedding a positive light on the future of HR. Talking about the current match, there are good chances to watch : de_mirage and de_dust2 as maps. If the veto will go so, HR should be a bit advantaged on Dust2, while Mirage can easily go both ways. Betting odds are widely skewed in favor of HR, but honestly we doubt we'll watch them losing twice, so we kinda agree on this trend and we're oriented in picking a Low bet on S1mple and friends. The chance to watch a Tie is pretty high too, so if you are betting through a provider allowing bets on Draws, go for it.
http://csgo.guru/match/2219!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5883!$coL!$LG!$null!$0.4!$0.23!$0.17!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$One of the most interesting games scheduled this evening. Yesterday, CompLexity surprisingly managed to beat Conquest in a tight Overtime on de_cbble. Despite the fact, Cobblestone is supposed to be one of the strongest maps for CQST. However, Luminosity are for sure a bit more structured than Conquest, and they are actually sitting on quite an impressive streak. Furthermore, they've always managed to find some success on de_overpass, while Conquest basically never played it prior to this match. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of LG, but honestly we agree with this trend. The Brazilians should be able to roll over coL in relative ease.
http://csgo.guru/match/2220!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5881!$CLG!$3sUP!$CLG!$0.7!$0.88!$-0.18000000000000005!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Not much to say since Betting odds have already turned to trash for this match-up. And as usual, when the percentages are around 90/10 we just suggest moving on, and not waste the time in betting for basically no reward. However, since CLG are clearly favored, the Bo2 format should guarantee a relative safeness.
http://csgo.guru/match/2221!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5893!$Cloud9!$WinterFox!$Cloud9!$0.6!$0.86!$-0.26!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is probably the best North American match-up scheduled for today. Cloud9 are for sure the number one team in the NA scene. In particular on de_dust2, where they have displayed on plenty of ocasions (including matches against top-tier EU teams), that they know how to play, and even today they clearly have the advantage. However, it is worth noting, its not unusual for C9 to perform a bit shaky in local games compared to International ones. Additionally we should also add that WinterFox were for awhile quite on-point on Dust2, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a closer than expected game. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of C9, due to their leading position. But honestly with these percentages, we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on WFox, since D2 always always seems to be a map quite prone to upsets.
http://csgo.guru/match/2222!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5884!$CLG!$Method!$CLG!$0.7!$0.89!$-0.19000000000000006!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Again a match already afflicted with quite terrible Betting odds. Just like the CEVO match we previously reviewed, we highly doubt we'll watch CLG losing a Bo2 against Method, with a worst case scernaio of the match ending in a draw. So basically, this categorizes this match similarly as a fairly safe game. Anyways, point of note; Method has displayed some signs of promise by putting together a generally improved week. In actuality, we do believe they are doing quite fine at cementing their position within the North American mid-tier. As stated above Betting odds are quite off, and after all we're talking about a pretty safe game, so you can either go High on CLG or skip and move to the next game.
http://csgo.guru/match/2225!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5897!$NiP!$HR!$HR!$0.6!$0.71!$-0.10999999999999999!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$In the past couple of days NiP has failed pretty badly against both TSM and (surprisingly) G2. But at least they looked pretty fine in a more encouraging match versus HR yesterday (16-2). So today we doubt we'll watch something really different. For sure de_cache is a bit more tricky as map, compared to de_dust2 where NiP and HR faced-off yesterday, and here HR are supposed to be a bit better as well. However NiP surely have the advantage, and betting odds are currently decent enough for going Avg on F0rest and friends.
http://csgo.guru/match/2226!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5898!$FSid3!$Vexed!$null!$0.55!$0.73!$-0.17999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$A pretty even Tier2 match here. FlipSid3 haven't been doing too bad, and basically they managed to hit most of the goals they planned, Major qualification included. For sure they aren't the most consistent team out there, but their teamplay has been acceptable and when their roster is focused, they are fully capable of dealing with most of the T2 teams around. Making them, overall, usually a kinda reliable pick. On the other hand, Vexed are a quite cryptic team. They always perform surprisingly well against high-end opponents, but they keep struggling versus low-tier teams. So guessing how they are going to perform is always a challenge. Even their veto doesn't follow any understandable pattern. This is a GA Bo2, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a Tie since both teams should be pretty even side-by-side making this a mostly pure 50/50 match. However, on our end, we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Fsid3 since we find them a bit more reliable.
http://csgo.guru/match/2227!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5900!$Dignitas!$SK!$Dignitas!$0.6!$0.76!$-0.16000000000000003!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well, not much to say, Dignitas always played de_inferno in a pretty decent way and their performances always been in line with the rest of the top-ranked Tier2 teams. On the other hand SK are in a slump since a while and they never really on this map too, so we're quite confident in picking an Average bet on Dignitas and we doubt we'll watch any huge surprise (we don't think we'll see SK taking more than 10 rounds).
http://csgo.guru/match/2228!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5901!$Dignitas!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.4!$0.31!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is an extremely interesting match and also our Game of the Day. No question EnvyUs are actually one of the best Tier1 teams around. Butt honestly in the last few online matches they've looked fairly inconsistent, and despite managing to put together a few decent victories they're surely struggling way more in comparison to their impressive Lan performances during DH London. On the other hand Dignitas yesterday managed to roll over their biggest Tier2 rivals (HR &amp; Mouz) with relative ease. Overall, they've looked well focused and more consistent on the extended map-pool. This game is taking place on de_overpass, a map where Dignitas always performs well, something we cannot say about EnvyUs since this used to be one of their usual vetoes, with the latest iteration of their roster having played here just a couple of times, without achieving relevant results. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of EnvyUs due the better lineup, but honestly we wouldn't be surprised to watch Dignitas putting up both an organized and tough fight. So we're oriented in attempting a Low bet on the Danish side (Dignitas).
http://csgo.guru/match/2229!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5894!$Penta!$SK!$Penta!$0.5!$0.38!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite a balanced matchup. Both teams haven't performed too welll in the short-term, so overall we're talking about a game that can easily go both ways according to the map picks. Penta have potential, sporting a new lineup which is certainly shows promise. In the past few weeks they've played a bit better compared to SK, however they're still struggling with inconsistency on the extended map-pool. and despite featuring some talent they aren't quite organized enough to offer a consistent fight throughout an entire Bo3. On the other hand SK are probably a bit better. On paper, their lineup is quite decent, but lately their gameplay has been kinda messy and after a promising start in late august, this roster has been basically free falling. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph there are good chances to watch : de_mirage, de_dust2 and de_inferno. If it goes so, Mirage should be in favor of Penta, while Inferno will likely go to SK. Leaving D2 as mostly a coin-flip. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of SK, but at our end, we're prone to considering this game as a pure 50/50 matchup, but our pick is a Low bet on Penta, in order to take advantage of the slightly more profitable percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2230!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5899!$SK!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.3!$0.15!$0.15!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Honestly not much to say since Betting odds are already trash. Obviously EnvyUs are favored and even though the French side have never provided many outstanding performances on de_train, we highly doubt we'll watch them fail against a pretty disorganized team such as SK. As stated above, betting here is mostly a waste of time, since the chances to see an upset are extremely low, while the percentages for going with EnvyUs, on the other hand, aren't profitable at all. If you really want to drop a bet here go for Envy, otherwise just skip and move to the following game.

For sure CompLexity have been playing well lately, with victories over both LG and Conquest that really werent expected. However, we do have to consider that we are talking about a match taking place on de_inferno. Somewhat of a usual veto for coL. A map where, overall, they haven't really played too well. On the other hand, Enemy used to be rather decent on Inferno. Although their roster isn't quite on par with that of coL, they have already managed to beat them once on de_train. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch them pull off yet another upset. Betting odds are widely skewed in favor of coL, but we believe we'll watch a close game tonight. So our pick is an ICB on Enemy.
http://csgo.guru/match/2234!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5922!$Cloud9!$LG!$Cloud9!$0.6!$0.69!$-0.08999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Big match of the evening. Yesterday Cloud9 surprisingly managed to lose against FE in overtime, and honestly we couldn't believe our eyes while watching it happen. Especially considering FE has never put on any convincing performances. Its actually the reason they're not even listed in our database. However, sometimes miracles do happen, and we just have to accept it. Excluding yesterday, C9 have looked pretty solid so far, and seeing as they have found success on de_train in past, we remain confident in them. On the other hand, Luminosity somehow managed an unexpected loss yesterday against coL. They've also never really excelled on Train,(a map ther've started vetoing on a consistent basis as of late). We'll probably watch a pretty even match, despite the past couple of shaky results from both sides. We've slightly more hope in C9 at this point, but honestly Betting Odds are too skewed. So we're more inclined to attempting an ICB on Luminosity and play-safe, without risking huge values on Nothing and friends.
http://csgo.guru/match/2235!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5923!$LG!$Conquest!$LG!$0.55!$0.59!$-0.039999999999999925!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Yet another extremely interesting game. Luminosity are moving here warmed up foloowing their match against Cloud9, so they'll likely be slightly fresher than Conquest. Especially since the map will once again be de_train, so LG can make good use of the extra practice provided in their pevious game. On the other hand, we need to underline that Conquest are not an easy opponent by any means. They are well trained on de_train and have already faced LG on Train in early September, where they lost by a bunch of rounds. But now the roster is way more glued and polished, so we can probably expect an even better performance. Here real-world odds are in favor of Luminosity mostly because they're coming form a match on the same map, but these Betting odds are way too skewed. Overall, there is a good chance to watch a close match, so we're a bit more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Conquest.
http://csgo.guru/match/2236!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5924!$Coast!$Cloud9!$Cloud9!$0.25!$0.11!$0.14!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Honestly not much to say regarding this game. Odds for this match are already pretty terrible, and we don't see any real point in betting on this game since in just few hours we'll move into PGL Finals. Where we'll enjoy a couple of extremely high-end matches, so better to save your skins for something enjoyable to watch. Now we acknowledge that C9 somehow managed to lose to FE yesterday, so this might tease you in considering dropping an ICB on the underdog this time as well, but we want to remind you that miracles rarely happen twice in a row. So you are very likely going to lose your Bizons. On the other hand the 90/10 odds aren't rewarding at all for a bet on Cloud9. Better skip the whole thing and move on.
http://csgo.guru/match/2238!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5913!$Liquid!$VP!$VP!$0.4!$0.14!$0.26!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$First match of the PGL Lan Finals, taking place in Bucharest, we begin with the Semifinal featuring one of NA's top contenders Liquid who are also the statistic underdog of the remaining group. But to their deserved credit, Liquid is entering the weekend backed with some needed confidence, compliments of their performance that landed them a spot in DH Majors in Cluj. Although Liquid was favored, they still saw to it that their elimination of team Renegades was convincing. So they'll be looking to pick up where they left off, but they will need to be firing on all cylinders to compete with their opposition, in VP. We also need to add that the North American side didn't play any online game since they competed @ DH Stockholm in late September, so basically they took a whole week off just in order to prepare for this event. Virtus.Pro on the other hand, are not beginning the weekend with the same winning confidence benefit as Liquid, but quite the opposite. Following a surprising victory over Fnatic, VP fell short in three hard fought losses against TSM, Titan, and EnvyUs. BUT they were very tight matches that are nothing to be too down on. So its also unlikely those losses impact the odds too much. Overall TaZ and the gang always played way better on Lan compared to online matches, so we'll very likely watch the Polish side playing just in line with their usual offline performances. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_overpass and de_train. If it'll go so, both teams should be quite aligned on Cache and Overpass, while Train will be in favor of VirtusPro. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of VP, we kinda agree on this trend since on paper they are for sure the better team, but honestly real-world odds aren't too far away from a 60-40 and with the current percentages edging 90-10, the only possible way to go is just an ICB on Liquid.
http://csgo.guru/match/2239!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5914!$Fnatic!$TSM!$TSM!$0.55!$0.61!$-0.05999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the second PGL Semifinal. Just like VP, also Fnatic aren't moving here on a great winning streak, but they are probably a bit more justifiable since their latest loss (16-10 against VP) happened on de_dust2, one of the few maps where they are actually beatable by the rest of Tier1 teams. While the previous one is from the extremely tight Gfinity Champion of Champions Grand-Final, where after-all they managed to put up a pretty good fight, despite the match ended 2-3 in favor of Envy. Honestly looks like that Fnatic started decreasing a bit their impact on the scene, they are not anymore a steamroller crunching victories over victories, of course they are still playing solidly and within the Top-3 range, but finally some cracks started showing up on their shield and the other top-trending teams are taking advantage of it. In particular EnvyUs, but also VirtusPro and TSM are on the edge, and already displayed to be fully capable to provide hard times to the Swedish talents. Talking about TSM, they are for sure one of the teams that improved the most since this summer, they collected a quite wide series of 2nd places, and even if the victory always slipped from their hands (at least on Lan), they proved to be one of the hottest rosters around. Worth mentioning that TSM sent Fnatic to packing @ Dubai Invitational and just yesterday they won CounterPit League (online) by rolling over EnvyUs thanks to a fair and square 2-0. The Danish side is for sure the most organized team of the bunch, their executions are always perfect, well timed and really amazingly planned. The down-side of this approach is that they rarely "cook-up" something really new, and even if this kind of 'perfection' frequently allow them to reach the final stages of the biggest Events around, they rarely manage to move out from their flawlessly organized scheme and provide the magic required for winning a Major title. Talking about the current match, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train as maps. If the veto will go so, Fnatic should be slightly advantaged on both Inferno and Train, while TSM will likely grab Dust2. Betting odds are currently pretty balanced, and we agree on this vision, but honestly we believe a bit more on Fnatic since they are usually pretty consistent on the extended map-pool, so our pick is a Low bet on them.

Yesterday we watched Liquid and VP open this weekend's competition in a Bo3 that only lasted 2, landing Liquid as the first team to face the elimination game. On Overpass, Hiko and the North Americans did play at an exceptional level fit for this competition, but VP lead by Snax and Taz managed to edge Liquid out 16-14. On de_mirage, Liquid found themselves out-classed and out-maneuvered by the Polish powerhouse, and honestly a NA team shouldn't ever try to challenge VP on this map, it's just a no/no idea. Overall they don't have much to look forward to in this next match-up either. On the other hand Fnatic, were quickly bumped by TSM in another Bo3 that only needed 2 maps to decide it's victor. With the exception of KRIMZ, the Swedes put up an underwhelming performance against the Danish side. Furthermore, its actually been a little while since we've spoke of Fnatic on the winning side. But even still, not many expected them to be in this showdown already. There is no time for either of these teams to reflect on their losses, but to turn their attention and focus to today's best-of-three. Talking about this game, naturally, odds were immediately skewed well in favor of Fnatic, and with just cause. So needless to say, with so little evidence to suggest Liquid can compete at a caliber on par with that of Fnatic, we're mostly in agreement with these odds (even if real-world odds are much likely around 70/30). We also need to add that Fnatic are currently incredibly upset due their 2-0 defeat against TSM, and we're pretty sure they'll move into this game quite hungry for victory and they'll mostly use it in order to vent frustration they accumulated yesterday. As for maps, when referring to the Veto Pattern, we expect to see: de_cache, de_dust2, and de_overpass. Liquid will need to hope for head start in series, and cache would be their best hope to do it. But in all reality, Fnatic is competent throughout most of the map pool, so none of these maps should really pose too much of a challenge. The only map where we expect Liquid to put up a great fight is Dust2. Although Liquid is hoping to continue Fnatic's losing streak, and considering everything we've seen this past week jammed packed with upsets, we are highly doubtful this match-up will add to that statistic. Considering how terrible these odds are you may skip, or go for an ICB on Liquid and hope for the unexpected.

TSM are rolling into this game pretty pumped up, and according to yesterday's interview, it sounds like they are looking forward to 'beat pretty hard' Virtus.Pro (but at least they'll provide some lubrication). Well honestly we're not so sure we'll watch this happen, and this kind of taunt may make VP even more motivated to win game. However, Yesterday TSM for sure provided a top-notch performance, and confirmed one more time their positive trend, winning over Fnatic 2-0 on Lan which isn't easy my any means, in particular on de_inferno, where the Swedes typically always play extremely well. About Dust2, there Fnatic mostly paid an excess of confidence, and instead they should have played 'safe' the veto-session, and avoid the map entirely, since most of the Tier1 teams figured out that this is their Achilles' heel. On the other hand Virtus.Pro, as usual played a kinda shaky first map (but it's always so) against Liquid, and they seriously risked losing it, but then they rolled over the North American side in relative ease on de_mirage (and here we should mention the over-confidence of Liquid on this map, honestly totally out-of-place, in particular against VP). Talking about the current match, overall TSM are looking a bit better, right now they are carrying an extremely strong momentum, and their victory over Fnatic shifted the odds even more in their favor. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_overpass, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto will go so, Overpass will likely go to TSM, while Mirage should be in favor of VP and Train can easily go both ways. Overall we're still talking about a quite balanced game, we're giving a little edge (in our real-world odds) to TSM due to the higher Form, but since the Betting Odds are a bit too skewed in favor of the Dannish side, we're more oriented in going Low on VirtusPro, in particular since the map-pool (if we nailed the veto) may bring an extremely close and entertaining match-up.
http://csgo.guru/match/2381!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5944!$Fnatic!$VP!$VP!$0.5!$0.6!$-0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$What a matchup! Both teams are entering this bo3 elimination contest following a couple of mediocre performances. Between the two,Virtus.Pro ,overall, probably demonstrated slightly more encouraging play. To be honest, their game against TSM could've been closer. Their results on de_inferno weren't too surprising since VP has never offered exceptionally good shows there. But we weren't actually sure how they managed to fall on de_train after the brilliant T side they performed. In short, had they hung on for the victory on de_train and pushed the match to a win or lose at de_cache, they could very well have had a different final outcome. On the other hand, Fnatic rolled over Liquid in relative ease, but they completely overlooked de_cbble. A map where usually play well, but they didn't approach the map with the right mindset or with a real plan behind the hood. Hopefully they'll be a bit more focused against VP. Now as for the current match, we can only say that we expect an extremely balanced match. Both teams are looking pretty well aligned, and in quite similar form. Fnatic are a bit better overall on the extended map-pool, and they'll certainly gain some advantage from the fact that VP will very likely avoid de_dust2. A map where the Swedes' weaknesses were exposed over the past few weeks. About the veto, we're pretty sure we'll watch: de_overpass, de_cbble and de_train. If this is how it unfolds, Fnatic should take Cobblestone (they weren't trying too hard for some reason in their match today vs Liquid...), VP may grab Overpass, while Train could easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Fnatic, but this is a pure 50/50 match-up. So feel free to go Low on VP in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2387!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5957!$HR!$E-Frag!$null!$0.5!$0.62!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not a lot to say here. Considering HellRaisers are most likely playing with 2 stand-ins (Oskar &amp; STYKO instead of Mou and adren), in addition to S1mple only playing on a part-time basis due his ESL ban (basically he plays a game every two) most of the data about HR isn't very relevant. So of course, predicting how they'll perform with a mix-like roster is mostly impossible. On the other hand E-Frag aren't the most consistent team out there. After a mid-summer played on the top, they started falling pretty quickly, and actually even though they are still placed within Tier2, they are seriously edging demotion to Tier3 in the next iteration of our World Ranking. Overall this is a pretty random game, and due the Bo2 format there is plenty of room for watching a Tie. At our end we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Efrag since we have more faith in a 'real' team, rather than in a random mix.
http://csgo.guru/match/2388!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5958!$E-Frag!$Titan!$Titan!$0.4!$0.28!$0.12!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Just another CEVO Bo2, this time E-Frag is facing Titan. This match, however, should be a bit easier compared to the previous CEVO game, since there aren't stand-ins and lineups are just composed of the normal rosters. Titan overall aren't shining their brightest at the moment. The landing of Scream in the French roster didn't bring about any clutch improvments yet, as the team continues struggling against mid-tier opponents, despite being expected to compete on par with Tier1 teams. Usually they are a bit more consistent in Bo2/3 matches compared to Bo1s, so despite the not-so-promising match history, we doubt we'll watch them struggling too much against Efrag, and in the worst case we'll likely just watch a Tie. E-Frag as we stated in the previous game as well, are facing serious troubles and their gameplay level does not resemble that of Tier2 caliber anymore. With some effort they might take a map, but nothing more. Our pick is an Average bet on Titan, which on paper this should be a quite safe pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/2389!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5962!$Conquest!$WinterFox!$Conquest!$0.55!$0.83!$-0.2799999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$With most of the WinterFox lineup still sitting in EU (== 100+ ping), we highly doubt that they'll be able to provide anything exceptional. With some luck they may manage to grab a map, but overall we don't believe they'll be able to take Conquest down. Conquest, On the other hand, has slowed their progression a bit, but we're still talking about a fairly consistent team. They have a good chance to take this match with a 2-0 score. Our pick is a Low+ bet on Conquest, with Betting odds still fine for going this way.
http://csgo.guru/match/2390!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5963!$WinterFox!$LG!$LG!$0.4!$0.06!$0.34!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say regarding this mid/low tiered matchup. Winterfox is coming to match directly following their match with Conquest. So they are sure to be more warmed up, but based on their match history, they need every advantage they can get. A series of losses has inhibited Wfx from gathering any steam for some foward progress as a team. Meanwhile, Luminosity continues to gradually improve and mesh as a team, so we don't expect them to find too much a challenge in handling the struggling Wfx team. However, this is a Cevo bo2, so keeping in mind the trend with many of these mid- teir matches, good chances for draw if LG can't manage the sweep. Its been a week of upsets, so risks seem slightly higher than normal, but we're still confident in a minimum of seeing all skins returned on a tie, however odds are so terrible you may consider a skip or an average pick on LG.
http://csgo.guru/match/2391!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5959!$NME!$Conquest!$Conquest!$0.35!$0.18!$0.16999999999999998!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Here we have another low-tier match from the RGN Freedom Cup, featuring the usual bo3 format. Conquest, will enter this match after short break following their Cevo match against WinterFox, where Conquest looked in good form as they quickly took the win 2-0. That victory did come in a match against a struggling Wfx (partially playing from EU), but the competition isn't going to be any tougher against an Enemy squad that continues to have difficultly getting in the win column. Conquest has had some more impressive outings over recent weeks, primarily against low teir teams but also against top-notch opponents, and to their credit they have been relatively consistent in winning those match-ups. As for maps, we'll likely see de_cache, de_inferno, and de_train. If this match is to make it to a third map, NME will hope to take advantage of Cache to do so, where they managed a very close matchup the previous meeting between these two teams, Conquest should take inferno without much resistence, while inferno should yeild mostly the same results. So an average bet on Conquest in our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/2392!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5946!$TSM!$VP!$TSM!$0.6!$0.71!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The Consolidation Final just finished and the schedule of this match has been anticipated by an half-hour, so we must keep this prediction extremely short since and the timeleft is extremely short. Overall the 1-0 default advantage for TSM will likely decide the match, the Danish side looked pretty on-point in the past days and we doubt they'll miss the chance of grabbing at least two maps. On the other hand VirtusPro managed to roll over Fnatic thanks to a fair and square 2-0, but against TSM will be a whole different story. Our pick is a Low bet on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/2397!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5969!$Penta!$HR!$HR!$0.55!$0.28!$0.27!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty even mid-tier game. Penta since they refreshed their roster, started doing quite fine, and overall way better than before, for sure they are still a bit inconsistent on the extended map-pool, but they should be able to grab at least a map in the current match. On the other hand HellRaisers when they don't mess with (too many) stand-ins, are pretty ok, and in particular in Bo1s they recently managed to take down both NiP and Titan (but they offered a good show against Envy as well). Real-world odds for this game are around 60/40 in favor of HR, and even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch Penta taking a map, our pick is a Low+/Average bet on HellRaisers (with the hope to don't see more thank a single stand-in). 16:30 CEST EDIT: Oskar and Styko will play instead of Mou and Adren, we don't advice to pick HR anymore, and instead we suggest to go Low on Penta.
http://csgo.guru/match/2398!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5967!$Dignitas!$CSGL!$Dignitas!$0.6!$0.8!$-0.20000000000000007!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Betting odds for this game are already pretty bad; but honestly we don't see Dignitas losing 2 maps in a row against CSGL. The Polish side looked really shaky in the short-term, and despite they managed to achieve some victories against extremely low-end opponents, they are still far away from performances capable to taking down a well structured Tier2 team as Dignitas. As mentioned above, Odds aren't exceptional, but after-all we're talking about a kinda safe game, and in the worst case we'll much likely watch just a Draw and skins returned; so our pick is an Average bet on the Danish side (Dignitas).
http://csgo.guru/match/2399!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5972!$Na'Vi!$Vexed!$Na'Vi!$0.7!$0.91!$-0.21000000000000008!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$This is a match-up that could be way closer than expected. You should keep in mind that Natus Vincere have the little flaw of not taking very seriously this kind of games against low-tier opponents, and we already watched them losing in this way plenty of times in the past. On the other hand Vexed are just the same, so while NaVi may not take this game very seriously due their high rank, Vexed will for sure do their very best in order to provide a good show against a top-tier opponent. Actually their very best is a kind of gameplay pretty dangerous for Tier1/2 opponents, and it also works pretty well since they managed to qualify to 2 Majors in a row thanks to it. Betting odds are currently extremely skewed in favor of NaVi, but honestly real-world percentages are way more close, and underestimating Vexed is actually an huge mistake, so since the percentages don't allow any decent bet on NaVi we suggest to go with an ICB on the Polish side.
http://csgo.guru/match/2400!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5968!$E-Frag!$FSid3!$FSid3!$0.4!$0.4!$0.0!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Just another quite even Tier2 match. E-Frag lately started playing in a quite inconsistent way, and their form is nowhere near the one they displayed during mid-summer when they were running really hot. In the short-term they failed to achieve anything relevant, they lost against a wide range of T2 and T3 teams, and actually they are edging demotion to Tier3. On the other hand FlipSid3 are currently sporting a really amazing teamplay, for sure they lack a bit of raw firepower since with the exclusion of Bondik the rest of the roster is composed by pretty average players, but after-all the results are what matter and this lineup in the short-term improved a lot and they are actually solidly placed within the Tier2. For sure the Bo2 format used by CEVO may trigger a Draw, but for sure Fsid3 are the advantaged side, and the ones that in this game have more chance to take a 2-0 victory; so our pick is an Average bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/2402!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5977!$WinterFox!$CLG!$null!$0.25!$0.09!$0.16!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Not much to say, considering half of WinterFox are still playing from Europe with ~150 Ping, so inline with the past several days, we highly doubt they'll manage to put up a decent fight in these conditions. Especially against a team such as CLG. With some luck, they might be able to take a map, but they certainly can't hope for anything more than a Draw. On the other hand, CLG are rolling along quite decently, and a bet on them should be a quite safe pick. Unfortunately percentages are already extremely off, so you can either go high on CLG (for basically no reward) or just skip (due to the Ping issues we cannot suggest an ICB on WinterFox).
http://csgo.guru/match/2403!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5990!$SK!$E-Frag!$E-Frag!$0.55!$0.37!$0.18000000000000005!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Well, here we have a couple of teams who are currently facing some serious troubles. E-Frag are free falling since weeks, after an extremely promising mid-summer where they peaked into Tier2 they didn't manage to keep their momentum and currently they are on a quite terrible losing-streak. On the other hand SK are quite off since a while, but at least they try, and even if they share with E-Frag a quite terrible match history we need to say that their matches are usually backed by some logic. Additionally just few days ago they rolled over the Bulgarian side during 99DMG Masters displaying overall quite decent things (but the match it self was really close). Betting odds are currently trending in favor of E-Frag, but honestly this is an extremely even match that can easily go both ways according to how will go the veto session. At out end we believe we'll watch: de_overpass, de_inferno and de_mirage. If the veto goes so, SK should be slightly advantaged on Mirage, EFrag may take inferno, while Overpass is 50/50. Our pick is a Low bet on SK since the current betting odds are way too skewed in favor of EFrag.

Titan is moving here after a couple of no-so-promising weeks, where they managed grab just few victories and overall provided a wide range of kinda disappointing and inconsistent performances. For sure the Bo1 format may give them a little hand, but honestly they never looked extremely on-point on de_train, so we don't have really high hopes. On the other hand, Fnatic are just back from their extremely disappointing PGL campaign, where they finished out from the podium without impressing too much, in particular displaying a serious lack of new ideas. However they are generally quite good on Train, so they should be able to roll over Titan without too many issues (if they join the game with the right mindset). Betting odds are still decent for an Avg bet on Fnatic, so this is our pick (but if they'll move to 20/80 we suggest to go for an ICB on Titan).
http://csgo.guru/match/2405!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5985!$HR!$FSid3!$HR!$0.45!$0.45!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not a bad Tier2 match, HellRaisers as mentioned for the previous game are playing with their new roster featuring Oskar and STYKO, overall they have a quite good raw firepower but on the other hand FlipSid3 for sure sport a better and more consistent teamplay. Overall there are good chances to watch just a Tie, since both teams showed pretty good things on the short term and also a quite similar Veto Pattern. At our end we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Fsid3 since we usually consider an organized team and a proper set of strats as more valuable than just plain good aim.

This is going to be really amazing, both teams are historically pretty fine on de_cbble and now that Fnatic started dropping the ball a bit, NiP may take advantage of this and grab a really needed victory, that could refresh a bit their not-so-good momentum. Despite the issues, Fnatic are for sure a advantaged, since their gameplay always been really solid, and even if they started looking a bit predictable their executions never stopped being extremely well tuned. On the other hand NiP lost the right path many months ago, their performances aren't really on par with their name, but they still have a set of players fully capable to deal with all the Top4 teams, at least in Bo1s. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Fnatic, and from a side we agree on this vision, but on the other we don't believe that the percentages should be so skewed since real-world odds are more around 55/45 (or 60/40) and Cobblestone is a map where both teams always performed fine, so we are more oriented in hoping for a ROAR from the dying Lion, and our pick is a Low bet on NiP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2407!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5993!$NiP!$TSM!$TSM!$0.45!$0.34!$0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the hugest match-ups of the day. TSM are obviously favored due their latest top-tier shows during PGL (&amp; previous events as well), and despite early today we had some doubts about their form right after their major victory (usually teams relax a bit after winning a big Lan) this didn't really happen to TSM, and they stomped HR without any issues, showing no mercy at all. On the other hand NiP are moving here after facing Fnatic, and we can't say that they are going to have a chill evening, for sure a victory over Fnatic could put them on the right mindset and maybe they could be able to perform fine against TSM as well, and honestly the Danish side never really impressed on de_cbble against top-tier teams, so this could be a solid eventuality. Betting odds are currently quite skewed in favor of TSM, but Cobblestone is a tricky map, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch a match way closer than expected, so our pick is a Low bet On NiP.

Overall G2 didn't play too bad in their entry game, and somehow managed to save the Bo2 thanks to a good show in the 2nd map, but honestly they are relying way too much on their personal skill rather than acting as a team, additionally their timings looked quite off and overall the whole action was way too slow. On the other hand EnvyUs are on a quite solid winning streak, and actually they look more dangerous in Bo1s rather than in games featuring the extended map-pool. Train isn't their favorite map, they vetoed consistently during a good slice of the summer season, but honestly they are pretty decent on it, and if they'll manage to focus properly on this game they should be able to roll over G2 without too many issues. Betting odds are currently still fine for a Low+/Avg- bet on Envy, so we're oriented in picking this way.

CSGL are probably a bit better skill-wise compared to SK, and their raw-firepower is for sure higher, unfortunately their match management is just terrible and they have serious issues in providing solid executions, most of their actions are extremely confused and most of the times quite pug-like. On the other hand SK definitively slightly better organized, and even if sometimes they tilt pretty badly, they at least try to replicate schemes and ideas that on the paper are actually decent. Overall this is a pretty balanced game, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch a Tie, Betting odds are still pretty even, so at our end we're a bit more oriented in going Low on SK since we value more a decent planning than personal plays on very-selected pool of maps.
http://csgo.guru/match/2410!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5994!$HR!$NiP!$HR!$0.4!$0.33!$0.07!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well, third match in a row for NiP on de_cbble, the first two against Fnatic and TSM didn't go too well, but at least HellRaisers should be a manageable opponent. Overall HR never really played Cobblestone in an impressive way, but we should keep in mind that they already managed to beat NiP just a week ago, and they countered them really well, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them offering a serious resistance. Betting odds aren't too bad, NiP are for sure advantaged and the previous 2 matches should have woke them up a bit, so we're confident in picking a Low+/Avg- bet on them, with the hope to watch them winning at least a match.

HellRaisers are currently trialing STYKO and Oskar, and both players started playing with the rest of the roster since several matches already. Actually the HR lineup is looking a bit like a mix, they surely managed to achieve several really promising victories but overall they don't have any real plan, and they mostly rely on personal plays. On the other hand TSM are moving here after their first serious victory (@ PGL Finals), and obviously the Danish side spent the past few days chilling rather than practicing, usually they are extremely good on de_overpass, so on paper they shouldn't face any real issue, however the first game after a LAN victory is always a bit tricky, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch an upset. HR on the other hand aren't too bad on Overpass as well, and since the Betting odds are currently pretty off we might play safe and attempt an ICB on HellRaisers, just to check if TSM are on-point or if they are moving here still too excited by their recent great results.

Both teams are fighting since a while for the top spot within the Tier2, and in the past months they faced each other multiple times with mixed outcomes. Currently Dignitas are looking a bit better, and for sure the Danish side is sporting an higher form, but Mousesports aren't doing too bad either, additionally on Cobblestone both teams always showed similar performances and the previous games were pretty balanced as well. This is mostly a 50/50 game, and Betting odds are currently quite even too, at our end we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Dignitas due their stronger momentum, but we really suggest to avoid huge values because the extremely high risk.

This time we have TSM and Titan battling on de_overpass. Honestly this is not the best map pick for the French side, since they always kinda struggled on it and they rarely provided a logical teamwork. On the other hand TSM proved plenty of times to be really on point on Overpass, and they always favored it over Cbble. Betting odds aren't really profitable right now, and betting on TSM with these odds isn't really exciting, despite they are for sure fairly advantaged, Tier1 Bo1s games are always kinda unpredictable and calling out Titan too early could be a mistake. So even if we believe that TSM will win, our pick is a #yolo ICB on Titan.

On the other hand Dignitas woke up a lot compared to early September, and now they are (again) strongly cruising towards the top of the Tier2 ranking. Just note that they'll play the first map of this match with Xizt instead of Pimp, and this can only make things better. Betting odds are currently widely skewed in favor of G2, but this isn't really correct since they took a pretty long break during the past week and despite the promising Bo1 results they always been kinda inconsistent in Bo2-3 matches. Overall there are quite good chances to watch a Tie, but if you want to pick a side we suggest to go for a Low bet on Dignitas in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages.

Liquid are just back from a quite long series of Lans competition, and this is going to be their first Online match in a while. Overall they struggled a bit against most of the T1 EU teams, but this was expected. Their roster can surely benefit from more International experience in order to compete with the big names of the scene. However, in this case we're talking about a local match, and they never really encountered any huge issues when playing most of the NA teams. So of course they move here as obvious favorite. Luminosity, on the other hand, has slowed a bit after a mid-summer run playing at the highest level, but overall they are still solidly placed amongst the NA top-4, and they are for sure a serious threat, in particular in Bo1s. Current Betting Odds are a bit skewed in favor of Liquid, but overall quite balanced. On our end, we're slightlyt more oriented in going with Liquid, since we believe that their momentum is a bit stronger compared to the Brazilian side, but we don't suggest going any higher than a low bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/2420!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6016!$Liquid!$Method!$Liquid!$0.7!$0.82!$-0.12!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Honestly not much to say about the 2nd NA match we're covering. Method has lately appeared as though they're coming to life, and they are currently to be taken as a threat in the NA Tier2. But they are still have a ways to go before being considered amongst the top-ranked teams, so Liquid shouldn't face any real issue in rolling over them. Especially since we are talking about a match taking place on de_overpass. A map where Liquid has played pretty well, not just against NA teams but also versus the top EU competition, so we're pretty confident in going with an Average bet on them (Liquid), even though current Betting Odds aren't the least bit exceptional. (So wait a bit before placing your bet, and if the percentages turn into 90/10 just skip).

On paper, real-world odds are quite even, but honestly considering de_inferno was the map picked, Enemy should have a decisive edge. This is one of their favorite maps, but also one of the few maps where they play on par against well ranked teams as well. On the other hand, Method has never really offered any impressive shows on Inferno. They don't play it on a daily basis, and have vetoed it plenty of times in the past as well, however they are currently performing on a slightly stronger momentum, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them open the match with the pedal to the metal. But in the long run, Enemy should be able to grab a victory. Our pick is a Low+ bet on Enemy.

Currently HellRaisers are on a quite impressive streak, and even if their teamplay is still a bit messy we can't deny that the reworked roster is doing extremely fine, and both Oskar and STYKO are mixing really well with the rest of the old HR lineup. Without doubt they have potential, and if they'll manage to keep this trend on the mid-term, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them seriously threatening the big names. On the other hand, Gamers2 aren't doing bad either, in particular in Bo1 games they looked really fine, while they faced slightly more difficulties in matches featuring an extended map-pool. However they should be able to grab at least a map. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of HR due their recent impressive shows, but honestly this is a pure 50/50 game, and both rosters are really similar in composition and way to play, so there are really high chances to watch just a Tie. Our pick is G2 just because the slightly more rewarding percentages.

Gamers2 are moving here well warmed up by their previous Bo2 against HR which will be very likely played on a pretty similar set of maps (de_dust2/de_train). On the other hand Titan woke up a bit compared a couple of weeks ago, and their gameplay seems a bit more organized, in particular in large maps where proper timings are the key. Yesterday they played pretty well in most of their matches, they managed to beat Fnatic and also forced NiP to OT (while TSM were just too much). For sure the Bo2 format is giving a little edge to Titan, and we doubt we'll watch them losing two maps in a row. Betting odds are till pretty decent for going for a Low bet on Titan, but overall we'll watch a quite close battle.
http://csgo.guru/match/2427!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6021!$HR!$Dignitas!$Dignitas!$0.45!$0.31!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$High-ranked Tier2 derby. We already expressed our thoughts about HellRaisers in their previous game against G2, so we'll just add that the new mixed roster is doing pretty fine, and they sport an incredibly high firepower. However for this match-up the picked map is de_train, and the new HR lineup never played on it a single time yet, so we are not so sure we'll watch them performing well against an extremely solid and well organized team such as Dignitas. On the other hand we need to remember that the Danish side never really enjoyed playing on the new Train, this doesn't mean that they are bad at it, because it's not the case since yesterday (on this map) they rolled over G2 in relative ease (and previously they provided solid shows on Lan as well), but for sure if they have to pick a map Train isn't their first choice. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of HR due the hype train generated by their recent performances, but our pick is a Low bet on Dignitas since they are an extremely reliable T2 team, and actually they are also on a quite strong momentum.
http://csgo.guru/match/2428!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6022!$SK!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.25!$0.13!$0.12!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Not much to say, Fnatic shouldn't face any real issue in rolling over SK on de_cbble. For sure the Swedes aren't on-point as they were during the first half of the year, but they are still ranked on the very top of Tier1, and we highly doubt we'll watch them having hard times on Cobblestone, one of their best maps. Lately SK improved a bit, and their latest victories are for sure promising, but they still have a long path ahead. Betting odds are already trash, and with percentages around 90/10 we cannot advice anything interesting, since going High on Fnatic for basically no reward is kinda pointless, while on the other hand we don't believe that an ICB on SK can pay off. So feel free to skip and chill while waiting for the NA matches.

Betting odds are already trash. Since percentages are around 95/5 in favor of Liquid, the betting options are quite limited, making a Liquid bet yield basically no reward. This is just absurd. After-all we're talking about a CEVO Bo2, and the chances of watching Liquid losing 2 maps in a row are quite remote. Furthermore, Coast are also playing with ScrunK and LEGIJA instead of draek and draWsouL. In the worst case we'll see this match played to a Tie. Basically, with these odds, picking a side doesn't make much sense, so we just suggest to skip and wait for some EU action.

Both teams faced each other plenty of times in the past, and Dignitas never managed to grab the upper hand. Honestly we doubt we'll watch them taking it now, even if they are for sure doing quite fine in the short-term. On the other hand TSM proved to be really on point on de_dust2, and they managed to beat most of the T1 teams on it, so they shouldn't face too many issues in rolling over Dignitas. However, Betting odds are kinda trash right now, and with percentages around 15/85 going High on TSM is quite no-sense (even if they are clearly favored), so the only way to bet here is by going with an ICB on Dig, hoping for an upset.

Honestly we're not talking about the most relevant match out there, but still not a big effort for teams such as Dignitas and SK. Overall the Bo5 format should prevent any huge surprise, Dignitas are currently on a quite strong momentum and they are also kinda consistent on the extended map-pool, so they should be able to take the upper hand in relative ease, without dropping more than a map in the process. On the other hand SK finally woke up a bit in the past weeks, and they managed to reverse their losing streak in a quite decent way, however we need to note that they mostly faced low-tier opponents, and Dignitas should be still several steps ahead. Betting odds are still decent for an Average bet on Dig, and even if the percentages aren't extremely rewarding we are prone to consider this match as quite safe, according to the great results achieved by Pimp &amp; the gang in the short-term.
http://csgo.guru/match/2466!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6068!$Russia!$Norway!$Russia!$0.6!$0.84!$-0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well not much to say, this is one of the very first TWC games we cover, since we find the tournament format kinda absurd both in the time schedule (matches in the morning!?) and in the format (with just 3-4 good rosters attending the event, the whole groupstage part was kinda useless). Additionally all the delays for sure didn't help in providing a smooth experience. Anyway, talking about the current match, Betting odds aren't really amazing and percentages are obviously skewed in favor of Russia since they are one of the best lineups taking part in the event, so far they rolled out from GroupStage in relative ease, but we need to note that they didn't face any serious team yet. However they shouldn't face too many issues against Norway, since we're talking about a Bo3 match and the Norwegians looked a bit shaky in their previous games versus top-tier rosters. As mentioned above, percentages aren't really super rewarding, but Russia should be able to take the upper hand, so our pick is an Avg bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/2467!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6069!$Germany!$France!$null!$0.45!$0.2!$0.25!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Honestly the most interesting match of the day and probably of the whole TWC 2015. Sadly we'll experience it in the Quarter-Finals instead of ahead in the Semis/Grand Final due the questionable "GroupStage + Single elimination playoffs" format; while less teams and a Double Elimination bracket was clearly the best pick for both the audience and the teams involved (Quality &gt; Quantity - One of the unwritten rules of CS when comes to events). However, France is fielding a top-tier roster, by far the best of the ones attending the event, and according to the fact that all of these players already played together for years (on the very top of the world), we highly doubt we'll not watch them moving ahead. On the other hand Germany is featuring a lineup mostly made by former Mouz players, and just like France this is a kind of mix working pretty well, and for sure a set of players capable to provide some issues to the Frenchmen, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Germans providing a fiery opposition and taking home a map as well. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of France, for sure their stars-filled lineup is above the German one, but we don't believe that under-estimating the Germans is a good idea, in particular since they displayed an extremely on-point teamplay in the previous games, so even if we believe that France will take this game 2-1, we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on Germany in order to take advantage of the Odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/2469!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6074!$Poland!$Sweden!$Poland!$0.45!$0.43!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We were more hopeful than optimistic thats todays TWC event would find more success than yesterday, but unfortunately we had another stressful day ruined by delays. We weren't even able to watch the Russia/Norway match in its entirety The working stream came to a frustrating hault as Norway prepared to even up the bo3 at 10-15 matchpoint on the second map. After that, we received any further action updates surrounding TWC after-the-fact. The delays and ddos eventually forced the most anticipated match of the bunch, (Ger-Fra), to played offline. Especially disappointing as there really wasn't any other pertinent CSGO action today to divert our attention. Nevertheless, we've finally arrived to the TWC SemiFinals. Admitedly, anticipation for today's games has been deterred by poor/limited event coverage, and based on what we've seen (or not seen), we highly doubt we'll enjoy a smooth veiwing experience. Regardless, here are our thoughts about the match. Overall, both teams have kinda followed a similar pattern. Although they are not the very best players representing their countries, they still managed to setup solid performances took the upper hand against most of their opponents. Sweden is certainly featuring quite heavier firepower compared to Poland, while the Polish on the other side, seem to mesh slightly better. In the long run they might be able to benefit from more structured gameplay. Betting odds are still pretty even, while the Bo3 format is probably giving a little edge to Sweden. We are a bit more inclined to consider Poland as a serious opponent, and as usual we view proper teamplay as more valuable than just a bunch of good names, so our pick is a Low bet on Poland.
http://csgo.guru/match/2470!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6080!$Russia!$France!$France!$0.4!$0.18!$0.22000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$This is for sure the better (and more interesting) Semifinal out of the two, particularly since it features two of the most complete lineups of the whole tournament. Just like France, Russia too fielded a Tier1 team, featuring quite a solid roster composed of experienced well-hardened veterans and the NaVi's stars Flamie and Seized. Overall, they done pretty well so far, even though they probably struggled a bit more than expected against Norway. But they are still a lineup fully capable of grabbing a map from the French tank. France, on the other side, are advancing here as huge favorites. They have the most complete lineup of the pack, who are also have the benefit of having played together due to the French shuffles. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of France, and though we agree the Frenchmen certainly have the advantage, but the current percentages edging 85/15 are a bit ridiculous. So we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on Russia (even if the chances for an upset aren't higher than 35-40% or so).
http://csgo.guru/match/2472!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6082!$Poland!$France!$France!$0.35!$0.2!$0.14999999999999997!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well, after a few days of problematic coverage, combined with a mix of streamed and delayed offline matches, we've finally arrived at the World Championships Grand Finals. So far today, they seemed to have finally managed a somewhat consistent schedule and event streaming. Hopefully that holds true for the Main event of the weekend. The semi-finals watched Poland eliminate the Swedes in three maps of their Bo3, to advance to the finals. Poland has certainly benefited from some structured teamplay performances, and looked pretty good dispatching Sweden, and even almost managed to sweep. So they are sure to be a confident group enetering the match, however the mix of players composing the roster are mostly tier 2, so they'll definitely have their work cut out for them. Meanwhile, France advanced past the Russians in a more convincing 2-0 victory, which was expected of course. The Frenchmen are sporting the most experienced and talented roster of the event, mainly comprised of former and current EnVy players. The high caliber lineup has been clearly reflected in the match betting odds throughout the weekend. And the same applies in this upcoming Bo5 Grand Final. Not much time allowed between the matches, so we'll get right to it. Odds are currently well skewed in favor of the French, which we mostly agree with, as we highly doubt we'll watch this match require all 5 maps. Poland may manage grab at least 1 map, and if they really find some momentum, maybe even 2 and make this a more interesting final. However, we don't expect France to lose any more than 2 maps, regardless of the veto. So our pick is average bet on team France

Liquid are currently riding a good streak within the NA scene. Although they've struggled a bit on Lan, they are still one of the teams providing the most solid performances on home soil. Their current momentum is going pretty strong, to the point we actually wouldn't be surprised to watch them perform on par with C9. On the other hand, Luminosity aren't doing too bad either. They are a bit more prone to tilting in Bo1 matches, but in Bo2 ones (such as the game we're reviewing), they should be able to grab a map and take home a Tie. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the North American side, and this is mostly a given considering Liquid are looking quite on-point, but honestly these percentages are a bit too skewed for our taste. Despite Hiko and friends having a little edge, we don't believe the 70/30 odds are correctly reflecting the whole situation. Honestly, there is an extremely high chance of watching a Tie, and so we're a bit more oriented in attempting a Low bet on Luminosity in order to take advantage of the overly skewed odds, in an overall mostly balanced match.

Penta for sure stepped up thanks to the refreshed lineup, but the German side is still having hard times in providing consistent results on the mid-term, additionally they look a bit shaky on the extended map-pool, so the Bo2 format is not going to give them an hand. On the other hand E-Frag are following a quite similar pattern, and actually they are pretty far away from their mid-summer performances, overall they are a slightly bit more solid on Bo2/3 but lately their teamplay isn't really on-point and we already watched them tilting plenty of times in the past few weeks. We wouldn't be surprised to watch a Tie, but since we need to pick a side we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Penta in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages.

The French derby is always an extremely interesting show, since both teams swapped players plenty of times in the past, and the mix composed by the two rosters also won the World Championship just a couple of days ago. Overall de_mirage isn't one of the favorite maps of these teams, when possible both sides avoid it, but generally EnvyUs are slightly more consistent at it, while we rarely watched Titan providing a well-organized fight on this map. Betting odds aren't really exceptional, and they are currently edging the "ICB" threshold, so we're oriented in suggesting an Avg bet on EnvyUs if the percentage in their favor will stay below 80%, but if the odds will move to 85/15 feel free to try an ICB on Titan.

Dignitas are currently top-ranked within the Tier2, and they are one of the trending teams of the past couple of weeks, with a good set of extremely good performances on their game history. On the other hand Natus Vincere are doing pretty fine as well, and in the past week they definitively woke up, even if honestly they didn't play too much in September, and they enjoyed a quite long vacancy compared to most of the other Tier1 teams (but this isn't a terribly bad thing, and mostly means that they'll move into the Oct-Nov madness a bit more fresh compared to their opponents). Honestly Dignitas never really impressed on de_inferno, while NaVi always played it pretty well. Current Betting odds are still fine for going with a bet on NaVi and this is our pick as well, but we suggest to stay Low in value, since GuardiaN and friends have the bad habit of overlooking a bit this kind of games, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch a score closer than expected.

Both Mousesports and Titan always played de_cache in a really similar (and inconsistent) way, we watched them achieving incredible upsets against T1 teams in the past, but we also watched them failing hard against T3 rosters. Overall both lineups have a kinda weird set of strats for Cache, looks like they are both fine in countering their opponents but they fail as soon as they have to impose their gameplay over low-end opponents that are playing passively. According to this, picking a side for this game is really difficult, and we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game that can easily go both ways. Betting odds are still in the middle, and at our end we believe we'll watch Mouz playing slowly while the French/Belgian side will be probably a bit more dynamic, and honestly the Mouz approach could be the better one, since Titan plans are always overly messy. So our pick is a Low bet on Mouz.

Anyway, talking about their team-performances they are in a slump since a pretty long time, and their red-text filled match history is quite self explanatory. On the other hand, Penta aren't the most consistent team out there too, but at least they usually have a decent teamplay together with a decent plan, so we are prone in considering them slightly advantaged, even if we're talking about a Bo2 match that will very likely end in a draw. Betting odds are still decent for a Low bet on Penta, so this is our pick, but honestly we don't believe we'll watch one of the sides taking the upper hand, (in particular if CSGL will manage to play on de_mirage) so as stated above the chances to see a Tie are pretty high.

SK after several terrible weeks are finally seeing the light again, for sure they're not the most stunning team out there but, we need to say that with some effort they could become a quite decent T2 contender, after-all they are featuring well experienced players that can still make the difference if put in the right conditions. On the other hand Reason during mid-summer had an impressive start, and they looked extremely well-tuned, then some roster issues forced them into a quite complex situation, with stand-ins and stuff, but overall we need to say that managed to keep an interesting setup and we believe that Hunden did a really good work with it (just note that all the jokes on Hunden always been driven by the pretty no-sense HLTV ranking, but in the real-world he's a pretty smart IGL). Anyway, betting odds are quite skewed in favor of SK, and this is correct since we're talking about a Bo2, and SK are supposed to be slightly better on the extended map-pool, however we need to say that there are also high chances to watch Reason taking a map, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch a Tie. Our pick is a bet on SK, but we don't suggest to go with values above Low.

As stated for the Fnatic's entry game, they aren't currently in their best form, and in the short-term they stopped being the impressive tank they used to be in the first 3 Quarters of the year. Just like de_dust2 also de_train is a kinda tricky map for the Swedish side, definitively not one of their very bests, but honestly EnvyUs never looked too consistent on it as well, and in the past months they vetoed it on a regular basis, while in the matches where they've been forced on it they never really impressed. This is a quite balanced match, and Betting odds are a bit mixed, at our end we find Fnatic slightly better on Train compared to the French side, so this is our pick, but we don't suggest to go with values above Low, due the very high risk.

E-frag as stated already in the previous game are in a slump since many weeks, and the Bo3 format against a Tier1 team such as Natus Vincere is not going to help them at all. However, we need to remember that NaVi are famous for overlooking this kind of matches, but since we're not talking about a Bo1, we highly doubt we'll watch them failing two maps in a row, and then in the worst case we should be able to see a 2-1 final score.. Betting odds aren't really exceptional nor profitable, but after-all this is a kinda safe match, and we don't think we'll watch any huge surprise according to the current form of GuardiaN and friends, so our pick is an Average bet on NaVi.

Titan already managed to beat Fnatic just a week ago on de_train, and today they're bootcamping as well, so there are some good chances to watch a quite close match. However de_overpass is not going to be an easy map for Titan, they vetoed it plenty of times in the short-term and they rarely offered interesting performances on it, so while from a side the bootcamp and the current momentum are quite fine for Titan, beating Fnatic on Overpass still requires a lot of effort. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Fnatic, and we agree on this, for sure percentages aren't really amazing but the Swedish side should be able to take the upper hand, so our pick is a Low/Avg bet on Fnatic.

Gamers2 are currently bootcamping and then we're expecting a slightly better teamplay than their usual (kinda average) one. However TSM are for sure quite good on de_dust2, and they'll move here already well warmed up by their previous game, so they are for sure advantaged. G2 lately aren't doing too great and in particular their latest performances on Dust2 were kinda bad, but historically they used to be quite decent on this map so we are confident we'll watch them doing better than the past weeks, thanks to the bootcamp. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of TSM, and betting on the Danish side isn't really rewarding with these percentages, so we're a bit more oriented in attempting a #yolo ICB on Gamers2, with the hope to watch them a bit more focused than usual.

Fnatic and TSM are fighting once again on de_dust2, and The Swedish roster will try to take their revenge on a map that is a bit the symbol of the new TSM era. Fnatic are moving into this busy Tuesday after a quite shaky set of performances. A week ago they have been sent to packing by VP during PGL Finals, and then the following online matches didn't really go as expected too. They have been hit pretty hard by Titan in their entry game before waking up in the following ones (but still without providing impressive performances). TSM on the other hand are cruising pretty high in the ranking, they are currently the team with the strongest form and momentum, and they didn't stop their streak right after a LAN victory, which is a good signal. Betting odds are still quite decent, and at our end we're prone in considering the Danish side advantaged on Dust2, so our pick is a Low bet on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/2493!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6144!$LG!$Conquest!$LG!$0.6!$0.74!$-0.14!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Quite interesting an matchup here, as always. Luminosity are certainly doing pretty well as of late. They have positioned amongst the North American top-3 since for quite awhile, in particular on de_mirage. Here they always perform pretty decently versus both NA &amp; EU teams. Additionally, just a few weeks ago they managed to beat Conquest rather convincingly on this map. On the other hand, Conquest have defintely show the promising T2 NA lineup. They started extremely well in September, and even though they are still doing quite fine, lately they slowed their run a bit on several maps where they've started suffering a bit. However, on Mirage they always seem to consistently play decently (for NA standards), even if Luminosity is probably still a step ahead. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Brazilian side, and we agree on this. Obviously percentages aren't extremely profitable, but after-all an Avg bet on Luminosity sounds like the safest idea.
http://csgo.guru/match/2495!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6124!$coL!$WinterFox!$coL!$0.55!$0.77!$-0.21999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The new CompLexity lineup is certainly interesting, but honestly they aren't the most consistent team out there. Most of their games are always way closer than expected, despite the tier of the opponents. They are a bit like Vexed in EU. They often seem to have consistent issues playing against low-profile teams, but still be capable of performing rexceptionally against big names. However in this case, they are ceryainly have the advantage of the current situation WinterFox find themselves in. So we're slightly more oriented in giving them a little edge over the NA-EU mix that currently composes Wfx. However the determined map is going to play an major factor in determining the outcome, and predicting a Bo1 without it being announced yet really isn't easy. Our pick is a bet on CoL, but we suggest keeping the values Low.
http://csgo.guru/match/2497!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6125!$NME!$WinterFox!$NME!$0.45!$0.82!$-0.36999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite an even game with these two teams. Enemy are for sure gain a slight advantage tonight, due to the messy WinterFox situation. But the Bo2 format is certainly going to make things a bit more interesting. With a couple of lucky maps, WFox could be able to provide a decent show and at least earn themselves a Tie. As stated in the previous games as well, Enemy are a tough opponnet on a select pool of maps, but they are still in need of improvement on many others, in particular some of the new maps. So theres a good chance to watch them fail at one of them, provided DevilWalk and friends try to take advantage going for those maps. Betting odds are favoring Enemy, and this is kinda correct, since we're talking about a Bo2. Honestly, we doubt we'll watch Enemy lose more than one map, so we're oriented in going Low on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/2501!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6133!$Titan!$mouz!$mouz!$0.55!$0.66!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Well, yesterday both teams faced each other twice, and while Titan managed to take the upper hand early in the afternoon, later Mousesports rolled over them on de_mirage. Here we've a CEVO Bo2, and honestly this is a quite balanced match, both teams have highs and lows on pretty different set of maps, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch the game ending in a Tie. In particular if they'll go for Mirage and Cbble. Betting odds are currently in favor of Titan, but honestly we don't believe they deserve more than just a 5% edge over Mouz, since we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game. At our end we are a bit more prone in attempting a Low bet on Mouz, in order to take advantage of the pretty off odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/2502!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6145!$Penta!$Na'Vi!$Penta!$0.4!$0.23!$0.17!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$Well not much to say, for sure Natus Vincere aren't the best T1 team on de_cache, and they vetoed it plenty of times in the past months, but on paper they shouldn't face any real issue in rolling over Penta, since the German squad always played this map in a quite awful way. However, as you should know, betting on NaVi in their entry game and in particular when they face low-end opponents is always a risk, since they have the bad habit to under estimate T3 teams, and then they frequently overlook this kind of games. According to this, we cannot deny that NaVi are favored, so we're oriented in going with them, but we suggest to stay Low in value in order to avoid unpleasant surprises.
http://csgo.guru/match/2503!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6140!$NiP!$EnVyUs!$null!$0.45!$0.3!$0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We already wrote extensively about NiP and their current (messy) situation in their previous match against TSM; so we'll not repeat the whole thing here, instead we'll just add that de_mirage is a quite tricky map, that may lead to surprises since both teams (in the short-term) never really excelled at it. Several months ago NiP heavy trained Mirage, and at some point they were quite well-tuned on this map, but then they started vetoing it again and their current status is a bit question mark. On the other hand EnvyUs always been kinda off on Mirage, and yesterday they also managed to lose versus Titan (on this map), so we don't find them a really reliable pick despite the strong momentum. Betting odds are currently widely skewed in favor of Envy for basically no reason, honestly this is a pure 50/50 game and with these percentages the smartest thing to do is picking a Low bet on NiP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2504!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6128!$CSGL!$FSid3!$FSid3!$0.4!$0.2!$0.2!$HIGH RISK!$AVG BET!$This is the first game of the new SLTV season, and also the only one Bo3 we'll enjoy today. CSGL as we stated may times already, are in quite a terrible slump. And have been for quite awhile now, and based on their recent performances, we highly doubt to see them recover anytime soon, in particular in a Bo3 game. On the other hand FlipSid3 are quite solid and steadily placed within the mid-Tier2, basically they are stuck here since months, from a side they struggle in going up in the ranking due their lack of firepower, on the other they cannot go down due their quite great teamplay. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Markeloff and friends, and we agree on this, so our pick is an Avg bet on Fsid3 since they are usually quite solid on the extended map-pool.
http://csgo.guru/match/2505!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6142!$Titan!$Na'Vi!$Titan!$0.5!$0.38!$0.12!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the very first really interesting matches scheduled for today. Titan never played de_overpass in an amazing way, they frequently struggled on it and also against mid-tier teams they rarely offered impressive shows. Natus Vincere on the other hand are generally better, this is one of their usual maps and even if lately they are a bit careless in several fields, they should be able to take the upper hand with a score floating around 16-12 or so. Betting odds are still decent for a Low bet on NaVi, so we'll go for it.
http://csgo.guru/match/2506!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6138!$CSGL!$Reason!$null!$0.55!$0.63!$-0.07999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not a super exciting match-up, CSGL as we stated many times already, are struggling pretty badly since months, while Reason had to deal with quite serious lineup issues. Honestly this is a quite random 50/50 game, and both teams are really inconsistent on the extended map pool. Generally Reason are a bit better teamplay-wise while the Polish side features a way higher firepower but a really limited pool of "trained" maps. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, but honestly CSGL should be capable to take this match, but we wouldn't be surprised to watch Reason taking a map and setting up a fiery opposition. Our pick is CSGL but we highly suggest just a Low bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/2507!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6139!$HR!$Fnatic!$HR!$0.4!$0.31!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Really interesting game. Fnatic today will play twice on de_cache, and usually they are quite fine on this map, as we already stated for their game against EnvyUs. On the other hand HellRaisers always played Cache pretty well too, and this is one of the few maps where they are extremely dangerous, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them providing a good show, in particular according to their latest performances versus T1 teams. Betting odds are currently quite skewed in favor of the Swedes, and this is pretty normal due their high-end position in the ranking, however, according to the current percentages we're a bit more oriented in attempting an ICB on HR, after-all they are the upset masters, and Cache is for sure a good map for them, so playing the odds could be profitable.
http://csgo.guru/match/2508!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6136!$TSM!$Titan!$TSM!$0.6!$0.79!$-0.19000000000000006!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say, TSM are actually one of the best Tier1 teams on de_overpass, while Titan never impressed on this map, so honestly we don't know how they managed to end on it. Currently TSM are also on a quite amazing winning streak, and also one of the teams sporting the highest Form, so we highly doubt we'll watch them suffering against the kinda messy teamplay of the French side. Betting odds aren't really exceptional and not really profitable for a bet on the Danish side, but honestly we don't really see them losing this game, so our pick is an Average bet on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/2509!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6137!$Na'Vi!$EnVyUs!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.32!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$On paper a quite balanced match, in reality the chances to see Natus Vincere winning it are kinda poor, according to how bad they are playing in the past days. Honestly we don't really know why they started playing so, they always been a pretty organized team, but lately they are really overlooking plenty of matches and honestly this is not a really good sign. On the other hand, EnvyUs are usually quite decent on de_train, even if it's not one of their best maps, but at least their momentum is currently quite strong. In normal conditions, our pick would be on NaVi, since their performances on this map are usually superior than most of T1 teams, but actually we're kinda concerned by their current situation, so we're a bit more oriented in going Low on EnvyUs.
http://csgo.guru/match/2510!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6146!$Fnatic!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.45!$0.43!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Match of the day and one of the most even fights we'll enjoy today. Bo1s on de_cache are always quite hard to predict, in particular when we talk about a top3 T1 match involving a couple of great teams. Fnatic lately slowed their run a bit, and they started facing serious issues against the now trending TSM and Envy rosters. However in this case both the Swedish side and EnvyUs always shared a similar level on Cache, but they always used a way different approach to the game. While the Frenchmen are usually more prone to counter-stratting, the Swedes are always way more aggressive and they used to be quite deadly in their T side compared to the average T1 trend (their T-side on this map is actually 2nd only to VP). Honestly in this specific match-up, the Envy's passive approach may work a bit better, so we're more oriented in going for a Low bet on them, anyway we suggest to avoid huge values since you shouldn't be surprised to watch Fnatic starting to the pedal to the metal.
http://csgo.guru/match/2511!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6136!$TSM!$Titan!$TSM!$0.6!$0.79!$-0.19000000000000006!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$One of the big matches of the day. NiP are moving here after a couple of quite terrible days and overall they are a bit in a slump since several months. Actually, placing NiP into a specific category isn't really easy, their slump is different from most of the others, their players are totally fine skill-wise and their teamplay &amp; strats are (kinda) ok as well, but they have a really weak motivation and after a bunch of bad rounds they just tilt and give up, honestly this is the worst type of slump and I don't believe they'll be able to solve it by their own without some kind of psychological help (HeatoN worked pretty well on lan, but imho they should bring-back Fifflaren as full-time coach for the daily biz). However, on the other hand TSM are for sure doing pretty well, and in particular on de_dust2, they proved to be quite on point. So they are obviously advantaged, but well, currently Betting Odds are terrible, and betting on TSM with percentages around 85/15 is totally no-sense, so our pick is an ICB on NiP, with the hope to watch them bouncing back.
http://csgo.guru/match/2512!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6135!$CSGL!$E-Frag!$null!$0.45!$0.27!$0.18!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Honestly not the greatest game out there. CSGL as we stated plenty of times already are on a quite terrible streak, and you can easily figure it out by checking their match history. On the other hand E-Frag aren't doing too fine as well, but at least they are trying to bounce back, so for sure they are a bit more promising than the Polish side. Anyway, we're talking about a kinda random Bo2 between a couple of really inconsistent teams, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch just a Tie. Current betting odds are trending in favor of E-Frag, and this is kinda correct, since they are a bit more reliable compared to CSGL, so our pick is a Low bet on the Bulgarian side too.
http://csgo.guru/match/2513!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6148!$HR!$EnVyUs!$HR!$0.4!$0.24!$0.16000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$AVG BET!$Not an obvious match as may look at first sight. For sure EnvyUs are currently one of top-trending teams, but HellRaisers since their roster changes are rolling quite fine too, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a good fight (don't forget that they beat NiP 16-2 on Cobblestone just a week ago). However, the French side is one of the best in the world on de_cbble, and even if we may watch a close fight, we doubt we'll watch them dropping the ball in one of their favorite maps. For this reason we don't suggest to take their yesterday fail against Titan as relevant, since happened on Mirage, one of their usual Vetoes. Betting odds are still decent for going Avg on EnvyUs, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2514!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6134!$mouz!$E-Frag!$null!$0.6!$0.79!$-0.19000000000000006!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well, after a quite disappointing month, finally E-Frag managed to bounce back, and yesterday they played a bunch of quite promising matches. However we need to note that today they aren't facing T3 opponents (nor a sleepy NaVi), but Mousesports, and they are moving here already well warmed up by their previous games. The German team is for sure favored, they have good chances to take this 2-0 and we highly doubt we'll watch them losing two maps in a row, so we're prone in considering this match kinda safe, and in the worst case we should watch just a Tie. Betting odds are still decent for an Average bet on Mouz, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2518!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6153!$LG!$WinterFox!$LG!$0.7!$0.91!$-0.21000000000000008!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say, WinterFox are still facing the usual issues related to the roster still split between EU and NA, so just like the past days we don't suggest to bet on them (despite they are for sure promising), and we are more oriented in calling a skip for most of the games involving them. However Luminosity are rolling pretty well, and they are solidly within the NA top-3, so we doubt they'll face any issue in rolling over DevilWalk and friends, in particular on de_train. Our pick is LG, but betting odds are already horrible, and we don't really suggest to waste time with percentages around 90/10, so feel free to skip and move on.
http://csgo.guru/match/2519!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6154!$Liquid!$coL!$Liquid!$0.6!$0.8!$-0.20000000000000007!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Interesting game here, and for sure a match-up that could be a bit closer than expected. Liquid are actually one of the teams to beat, and in particular on de_cache they've always been pretty on-point. As we stated for the previous game, they are currently riding a very nice winning streak. Overall, they are mostly solid throughout the whole map-pool, without any relevant exceptions. On the other hand CompLexity started strong, but lately have slowed their run a bit. And on de_cache, they never really excelled, nor have they provided any amazing results. Even thoug they have played it plenty of times. Betting odds are still acceptable for going Avg on Liquid, however they are dropping quickly so keep an eye on them and eventually go for an ICB on coL if they move to 85/15 percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2521!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6155!$Cloud9!$LG!$Cloud9!$0.5!$0.64!$-0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Another great North American matchup between two of the stronger NA teams. Cloud9 has kinda hit a bit of a rocky path, assembling a series of very inconsistent outings. They surpriseingly fell to team FollowEsports, and then suffered an upset defeat at the Crown's Invitational against Immunity. But they also handled teams on par with them, with convincing performances. They will also be coming into this game directly following Liquid, so to their advantage they should coming with some steam. Opposite them, Luminosity has been playing exceptionally as of late. They've mostly shown up for their mid-low matches. So Cloud9 is coming at a good time to test LG's conviction. LG will also be warmed up following their game with Wfx. So all the peices are in place for an exciting run at de_Overpass, a map both teams are quite evenly matched, so neither has a real map advantage. Betting odd are expectedly skewed fairly well in favor of C9, with respect to their rankings, but we feel this is an all around 50/50 faceoff. One we are quite looking forward. With odds being where they are, we going low on Luminosity.
http://csgo.guru/match/2524!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6150!$WinterFox!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.2!$0.04!$0.16!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Here we have mostly nothing to say. We've a CEVO Bo2 and half of the WinterFox roster is playing from EU, and as icing on the cake they are facing Liquid, who are actually one of the Top2 NA teams. It's pretty obvious that Liquid shouldn't face any issue in rolling over WFox, and the Bo2 is adding an extra layer of protection. However, Betting odds are simply horrible so betting here is quite pointless. We suggest to skip and enjoy some extra hours of sleep, since tomorrow will be another busy day filled with plenty of EU games.
http://csgo.guru/match/2526!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6160!$Fnatic!$Vexed!$Fnatic!$0.75!$0.93!$-0.18000000000000005!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Not much to say, Fnatic are for sure a bit in a slump, but this is something very limited to the high echelons of Tier1, so they shouldn't face any issue in rolling over Vexed in a Bo3. Additionally the Polish lineup isn't really peaking right now, and despite they managed to qualify for the next Major, their current performances are pretty disappointing. Our pick is (obviously) Fnatic, but unfortunately Odds are already quite terrible, so betting here is mostly a waste of time,
http://csgo.guru/match/2527!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6164!$FSid3!$Dignitas!$Dignitas!$0.45!$0.31!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite interesting Tier2 game. Both team are currently rolling pretty fine, in particular Dignitas managed to hit the top of the Tier2 chart again, thanks to a couple of weeks filled by great performances. Yesterday they surprisingly managed to beat NaVi in a really close OT and they also put up outstanding shows against Mouz and HR, their direct contenders for a T1 spot. On the other hand FlipSid3 are cruising in safe waters since a long time, they sport a really solid roster and their performances within the T2 are always really on-point, they struggle a bit more when they have to deal with T1 lineups (or high-end T2 ones), but generally we're prone in considering them one of the most reliable T2 teams. Betting odds are currently quite good for going with the Danish side, and honestly we find Dignitas a bit more reliable on the extended map-pool (this is a Bo3) and also more dynamic team-wise (compared to the lack of firepower affecting Fsid3), so our pick is a Low bet on Dignitas.
http://csgo.guru/match/2528!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6166!$mouz!$CSGL!$CSGL!$0.6!$0.9!$-0.30000000000000004!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Again a match-up sporting quite bad odds. Just like the entry game (Fnatic - Vexed) we highly doubt we'll watch Mousesports losing a Bo2 against CSGL, according to the crazy amount of structural issues currently affecting the Polish team. Honestly betting here isn't really profitable, and the chances of upset are pretty limited, so this is mostly a skip, however, if you want to bet anyway our pick is Mouz, and this is a kinda safe one (in the worst case we'll watch just a Tie).
http://csgo.guru/match/2529!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6190!$Titan!$TSM!$TSM!$0.4!$0.35!$0.050000000000000044!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Quite interesting match. TSM yesterday somehow managed to lose against NiP on Dust2, but honestly we're not really taking it as an extremely relevant result since D2 is always quite prone to upsets. However, this game is taking place on de_cbble, usually not one of the best maps for TSM, and a quite frequent veto for the Danish side, so we're a bit unsure about they performances on it and we wouldn't be surprised to watch a game slightly closer than expected. On the other hand Titan aren't really the most reliable team out there, they keep providing really mixed results since a quite long time and despite they used to play Cobblestone on a daily basis they never really managed to master it properly, in particular they always faced heavy troubles in the late-game. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of TSM, but if Titan will join the game with the right mindset there are good chances to watch a good and close show. So we're a bit more oriented in attempting an ICB on Titan, with the hope to watch them a bit more solid and smart than usual.
http://csgo.guru/match/2530!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6191!$TSM!$mouz!$TSM!$0.6!$0.81!$-0.21000000000000008!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second game in a row for TSM, this time the Danes are playing again on de_dust2, the same map where yesterday they lost against NiP. For this match their opponent isn't a T1 team but Mousesports, one of the Tier2 teams actually providing the most promising performances. Generally TSM are quite good on Dust2, despite their yesterday loss they always managed to put up quite great shows against all the T1 teams, so we doubt we'll watch them facing too many issues against Mouz. On the other hand Mouz never really excelled on D2, they for sure played it plenty of times and they also managed to achieve a couple of upsets on it, but overall they never provided a consistent flow of good performances on this map, so we're not prone in considering them as really reliable. Betting odds are trending in favor of the Danish side, and currently they are still decent for a Low+/Avg bet on TSM, so this is our pick too.
http://csgo.guru/match/2531!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6171!$CSGL!$FSid3!$CSGL!$0.4!$0.27!$0.13!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well, in the past days we already looked extensively into the CSGL not so bright moment, and we highly doubt we'll watch them coming back anytime soon without any drastic lineup change. However here we're talking about a CEVO Bo2, and with some luck they could be able to take a map (in particular in case od de_mirage) and hit a Tie. On the other hand FlipSid3 are actually pretty solid, as we stated in their previous game too, they are currently rolling pretty fine and they are moving into this match as favorite, overall they should be able to take at least a map and they have about 60% of chances to win the whole match with a 2-0 score. Betting odds aren't really exceptional nor really rewarding, but after all we're talking about a kinda safe match, so we're oriented in picking an Avg bet on Fsid3.
http://csgo.guru/match/2532!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6192!$Dignitas!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.33!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$For sure one of the most interesting matches scheduled for today. Fnatic as we already stated many times, are a bit in a slump, but honestly de_mirage shouldn't be an extremely critical map for the Swedes, and on paper they should be clearly advantaged over Dignitas. On the other hand the Danes are actually the top-ranked T2 team and one of the roster currently featuring the strongest momentum, so for sure they aren't an opponent to underestimate, but we need to note that usually they aren't really consistent on de_mirage, and even if they played it plenty of times in the past weeks, they always looked kinda messy strats-wise and not really smart in the CT side management. Betting odds aren't extremely skewed and still pretty good for a Low bet on Fnatic, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2533!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6193!$mouz!$Dignitas!$Dignitas!$0.45!$0.38!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$At first sight a quite interesting match, but honestly we doubt we'll watch any surprise since de_train is usually a map in favor of Dignitas. As we wrote already for the previous games of the Danish side, they are actually the top-ranked team within the Tier2 and currently on a quite good streak, as team they are generally pretty on-point on the whole map-pool with just a couple of nay maps. On the other hand Mouz are one of the few T2 teams capable to mess with the Danes, but honestly this isn't a great map pick for them, and in the past months they never really played Train too much, in particular online, so we don't believe they'll manage to grab more than 12 rounds or so. Betting odds are currently pretty decent for going Low on Dignitas, so this is our pick too.

Overall we wouldn't bee too surprised to watch Reason (with some luck) grabbing a map, but honestly we believe that going for an ICB on them is an unneeded risk, and an Avg bet on Fsid3 is for sure safer, since in the worst case we'll watch just a Tie.

We already talked extensively about CSGL and their poor condition in the previous match, while on the other hand Gamers2 should be finally able to take a match after a week filled by plenty of quite unlucky results. Actually the Bo2 format should provide an extra layer of protection, and we highly doubt we'll watch G2 losing two maps in a row, so in the worst case we'll likely watch just a draw. Unfortunately betting odds already turned into trash, so despite our pick is G2 we don't really suggest to bet when percentages are around 90/10, due the really low profitability.
http://csgo.guru/match/2536!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6178!$Penta!$Titan!$Titan!$0.4!$0.13!$0.27!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$One more Bo2, and again the format should provide an extra hand to the favorite team, in this case Titan. While Penta for sure improved a lot during the past weeks, and finally the new lineup started rolling properly (yesterday they managed to beat NaVi), we doubt they'll have enough power to take down Titan on two maps in a row. Our pick is an Average bet on Titan, since we don't believe we'll watch the French/Belgian side failing twice in a row, and in the worst case they should be able to grab a Tie and save your skins/money.
http://csgo.guru/match/2537!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6170!$HR!$NiP!$NiP!$0.45!$0.4!$0.04999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the best match scheduled for today. HellRaisers are currently on a crazy streak and actually we're kinda stunned by them, and by how a mix composed by a so different set of players is working so well (kudos to HR as org for having the balls of picking new names). In the past few days they basically won against most of the T1 teams, they managed to roll over Fnatic, EnvyUs and NiP. Quite impressing for a lineup together since less than a month. On the other hand NiP are still on a rollercoaster, few days ago they lost 16-2 against HR, then yesterday they somehow managed to win over TSM and then they fell again against EnvyUs, so actually guessing how they'll manage a match is quite impossible and pretty random. Betting odds are currently in slightly favor of NiP, mostly because the Bo3 format, but honestly even if we're prone in giving a 5% edge to the Swedes due the extended map-pool, we're more oriented in trying a Low bet on HR, since we believe that they are in a "state of grace" that makes them a real threat on basically every map.

(Desi as standin for Skadoodle) Well, for sure an interesting game to help kick off tonight's NA matches. However we need to note that playing on de_train against Cloud9 is not going to be fun for CompLexity since this is one of their best maps. And they've consistently been extremely well tuned on it. Additionally, coL aren't really on much of an impressive streak, and in the past couple of weeks their performances have been quite inconsistent. So C9 shouldn't face any huge difficulties in rolling over them. Betting odds are already quite bad for going with C9, and they continue dropping, so even if our pick is an Avg on Skadoodle &amp; Friends, we don't really suggest betting if percentages are around 90/10, due the very low profitability.

(Desi as standin for Skadoodle) Not much to say for this matchup (at least a this point in time). As we already explained over the past days WinterFox continue to experience roster issues, due to their team currently split between EU and NA. So for obvious reasons, they really cannot put up a performance of their full potential against mid-high end NA teams. Today they are facing Cloud9 in their entry game, so we highly doubt they'll manage to gain the upper hand against the current top-1 NA. Betting odds are already trash, so despite our pick is C9, we really don't suggest wasting time messing around on a 90/10 game.
http://csgo.guru/match/2544!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6189!$LG!$coL!$LG!$0.6!$0.75!$-0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$UPDATE: Match map has been changed to de_cache. Following pred was based on de_train, so its now mostly not applicable Third match in a row for CompLexity on de_train. (Pretty boring day for coL], and this time they are facing Luminosity. Just like Liquid, LG are doing pretty well overall, and they are currently sitting within the Top-3. However we need to remember that Train isn't one of their usual maps. They frequently veto it, and this is one of the few maps where they never excelled. So exactly like the previous coL game we are pretty sure we'll enjoy a close match. Betting odds are quite interesting, and actually way too skewed in favor of LG, so our pick is again an ICB/Low bet on coL.
http://csgo.guru/match/2546!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6186!$Liquid!$CLG!$Liquid!$0.55!$0.69!$-0.1399999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Now this is a big match of the day, and finally quite a good show to bet on. At this juncion, both teams are actually playing pretty well, but overall the Liquid momentum is slightly stronger. Meanwhile, CLG are currently facing greater adversity against Top-Tier teams (while they commomly seem to tank vs low-tier teams). This is a CEVO Bo2, so there is a higher liklihood of watching a Tie, seeing as we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game, which can easily reach 1 map per side according to the picks. However, on our end, we're a bit more inclined to give a little edge to Liquid, since their curent teamplay is higher caliber compared to CLG, and also their potential on the extended map-pool is slightly favored. Betting odds are still rather decent for going Low on Liquid, so this is our pick. (BUT if they drop to 85/15, consider going for an ICB on CLG).
http://csgo.guru/match/2550!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6163!$VP!$Na'Vi!$VP!$0.55!$0.63!$-0.07999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Well, this is basically the only EU match scheduled for today. Despite this being a couple of top-tier teams, we don't suggest to take it too seriously, since these kind of showmatches are pretty pointless and in this case, both teams will get money regardless (winners will get $10,000, losers $5,000). So there isn't an huge difference between winning and losing. Virtus.Pro are generally better on the extended map-pool, so they should have a slight advantage from the Bo5 format. Additionally, they are also sporting stronger momentum and overall they're doing quite well. On the other hand, Natus Vincere haven't show much amazing stuff over the short-term. They had issues in dealing with Tier2 teams, and their gameplay is a bit messy compared to what they showed us during mid-summer. Anyways, as we stated above, we aren't really talking about a super-relevant match, so if VP joins the game with an overly relaxed mindset, (very likely), we might watch NaVi taking advantage of this in the entry maps. So after-all, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a close game hitting 4-5 maps. Betting odds are currently quite skewed in favor of VP, and honestly we do agree on this trend. But the Polish side has actually been more consistent compared to NaVi, so our pick is a Low+ bet on VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2552!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6212!$Penta!$TSM!$TSM!$0.3!$0.07!$0.22999999999999998!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Just another game featuring quite terrible Odds. TSM are supposed to be moving here after their game against SK (UPDATE: Match postponed) and we don't believe we'll watch the Danes experiencing much difficulty versus Penta on de_inferno. This is one of the usual Penta vetoes, and one of the few maps where the German lineup always seem to perform extremely inconsistent. Just like the previous match, TSM shouldn't face any issue in taking the upper hand, but unfortunately percentages already turned to trash. So betting here is again a waste of time, we're going to skip.
http://csgo.guru/match/2553!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6211!$Dignitas!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.4!$0.14!$0.26!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$On paper, this is set to be quite a nice matchup. Dignitas are peaking and they currently find themselves sitting amongst the top of Tier2 rankings. However, facing EnvyUs on de_cache is not going to be easy at all. Particularly since the French side always play this map exceptionally. Even though they looked a bit shaky earlier this week, they are still the big favorite to take this game. Betting odds are overly skewed in favor of Envy, while real-world percentages are more around 60/40 (in favor of Envy), so we're oriented in risking an ICB on the Danes, with the hope of watching them offer up a stellar outing.
http://csgo.guru/match/2554!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6210!$NiP!$Dignitas!$NiP!$0.55!$0.84!$-0.2899999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$This is a match that could prove to be a bit closer than expected. There is no doubt NiP has showed some pretty good things on de_dust2 over the past few days. But this is still quite an inconsistent and momentum based map, that can easily go both ways dependent on personal performances and a lil luck. (IE: NiP right before beating TSM on D2 almost lost versus GreyFace). On the other hand Dignitas are not renowned for their great performances on Dust2. A map where they have been punched in the face by plenty of T2 teams in the past. Anyways, Betting odds aren't too amazing, as they have already hit the 80/20 threshold. So despite NiP being obviously favored, we are a bit more oriented in playing the percentages rather than the matchup, so our pick is an ICB on the Danish side.
http://csgo.guru/match/2555!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6220!$Penta!$EnVyUs!$Penta!$0.4!$0.06!$0.34!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$Not quite the obvious match as may seem at first sight. de_overpass is a typical veto map for both Penta as well as EnvyUs. Over the past few months they haven't played there more than 3-4 times, so we're expecting more of an inconsistent game. As to be expected, EnvyUs are favored, and they have the advantage in basically every aspect, but as wrote above, playing on customary vetoes may lead to surprises. And over the short-term, the French may have overlooked many matches similar to this one (ie: the Titan-Envy on Mirage). A statistic we must consider. Betting odds are expectedly already totally trash, so we don't suggest wasting huge values on Envy for basically nothing in return, especially considering the potential high risk relative to this map. So overall, we're moreso oriented towards skipping the match as whole. But if you want to bet anyway, feel free to try the odds and drop a few cents on Penta.
http://csgo.guru/match/2556!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6221!$NiP!$Penta!$NiP!$0.6!$0.84!$-0.24!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Well, not much to say, de_train is the usual Penta veto map. A map they basically never played with the refreshed lineup. So we really can't see how they could manage to compete with NiP here, especially since the Swedes are actually one of the teams who've focused greatly on it. Similar to the previous games, betting odds are again already terrible and not rewarding in the least, however our pick is still NiP. So feel free to go with them or otherwise simply skip the whole game. (On Lounge 90/10 odds frequently results in no-returns).
http://csgo.guru/match/2557!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6216!$SK!$TSM!$null!$0.3!$0.09!$0.21!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say, we highly doubt we'll watch TSM facing any real issue against SK on de_overpass, a map where Dupreeh &amp; friends basically managed to beat the whole Tier1 scene. On the other hand we need to say that SK in the past few days surely improved a bit, but they are still pretty far away from the T1/T2 level. Betting odds are already quite horrible, and messing with percentages edging 95/5 is quite pointless, so even if our pick is TSM we don't really suggest to waste your time in non rewarding games.
http://csgo.guru/match/2563!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6224!$Imm!$Renegades!$Renegades!$0.5!$0.4!$0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Extremely important game since it will basically decide the team moving to the LAN Finals, the weird part is that due the previous results the current League situation is quite messy, and may lead to an underdog grabbing the spot. Unlike many other cups, the main Tie-breaker is h2h (then rounds difference), this means that Immunity MUST win this game, otherwise there are quite high chances to watch AnimalSquad or fSociety taking the spot instead, due a better h2h record. In case of a Renegades victory, the whole thing will end in a 4-way Tie, and then basically fS or AS will go through. However, since all these games are played as Bo1, predicting the map and the outcome is quite hard, in our opinion there are good chances to watch de_mirage as pick, and if it goes so we'll enjoy a quite balanced game since both teams are usually pretty fine on it. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Renegades, but honestly we're a bit more oriented in suggesting a Low bet on Immunity since we don't believe they'll miss their chance to hit the finals.
http://csgo.guru/match/2564!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6229!$E-Frag!$CSGL!$null!$0.5!$0.66!$-0.16000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite balanced match between a couple of pretty similar teams. After a quite disappointing month both CSGL and E-Frag finally bounced back, and they started providing again decent performances. This is a Bo2 game, so even if these rosters managed to fix some of their issues, we highly doubt we'll watch one of the sides taking the upper hand and achieve a clear 2-0 victory, so there are extremely high chances to watch just a tie. Additionally both teams already faced each other few days ago, and also that Bo2 finished in a Tie. Betting odds are overly skewed in favor of E-Frag, while we're talking about a game that can easily go both ways, so our pick is a Low bet on CSGL, but keep in mind that we're talking about a quite unpredictable &amp; risky match, so avoid crazy values.
http://csgo.guru/match/2565!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6234!$EnVyUs!$Dignitas!$EnVyUs!$0.6!$0.91!$-0.31000000000000005!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Basically the only Bo3 we'll enjoy today. EnvyUs are moving to this match after a quite challenging entry game against VP, so we expect them to be well warmed up and quite on-point. On the extended map-pool the Frenchmen are clearly advantaged, Dignitas are for sure doing fine and they are peaking within the Tier2, but they are still quite off against T1 teams, and in particular they rarely manage to keep the focus during matches featuring a Bo3 format. Anyway we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Danes taking a map, but EnvyUs should be overall better and capable to take home this match without many issues. Betting odds are already extremely skewed, so betting here is mostly a waste of time since the percentages are already terrible for going on the favorite team, and on the other hand Dignitas don't stand many chances to pull an upset. So our pick is Envy, but we highly suggest to evaluate a skip.
http://csgo.guru/match/2566!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6230!$Reason!$SK!$Reason!$0.45!$0.23!$0.22!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty random game, both teams aren't experiencing their best days, Reason had to go through roster issues and the new lineup is still quite shaky, while on the other hand SK despite they are featuring some really talented players, are currently one of the most inconsistent T3 teams, totally unable to follow a pattern, a plan or at least a generic gameplay idea. We wouldn't be surprised to watch this Bo2 ending in a Tie, in particular if Reason will manage the veto session smartly , however on paper SK should have a clear edge since they are for sure a bit more experienced on the extended map-pool. Betting odds aren't really amazing, but honestly we find safer going Low on SK rather than attempting a bet on the Reason roulette.

Here we're talking about a Bo2, so we believe we'll very likely watch a Tie, unless one of the teams will totally fail the veto. Betting odds are still pretty even and aligned to the middle, so there is no point in playing the odds. The smartest thing we can do is picking the most consistent team out of the two, so we are obviously more oriented in going Low on FlipSid3, since we find CSGL quite unpredictable and a bit limited by the rather small amount of maps they play decently. Just keep in mind that this is an extremely risky game, and even if the Tie chances are high we wouldn't be surprised to watch one of the sides failing hard during the veto and then gifting the game to the other.

HellRaisers are for sure doing well, but we need to note that on de_overpass they always played in a kinda average way, without providing any top-notch show. Additionally this is an ESL game, so S1mple is not allowed to play, and we don't know who will be the Sub yet (but Fix is a quite usual pick). On the other hand Penta just a couple fo days ago surprisingly managed to beat EnvyUs on this map, and this happened a bit like a lightning in the sky since the Germans never really focused too much on Overpass, in particular with the refreshed lineup. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of HR, and while they are for sure slightly advantaged we find that Penta have some real chances to pull an upset, so we're more oriented in playing the odds and going for a Low bet on Penta.

Overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch HR taking a map and setting up a consistent fight, but honestly TSM should be a couple of steps above and in the worst case we'll watch just a Tie (we're talking about a Bo2). Betting odds are already trash, so with percentages edging 90/10 we can only suggest to skip the whole game and move to more rewarding ones. However, if you want to bet anyway, our pick is obviously TSM.

Both Virtus.Pro and EnvyUs are currently doing quite fine, the Polish side is probably performing a bit more consistently compared to the Frenchmen, but we need to note that Envy are prone to overlook only low-tier games, so we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 match-up. With that said, VP never enjoyed too much playing on de_dust2, even if lately they improved a lot (and managed to achieve many convincingly results too). On the other hand Dust2 always been one of the winning horses of the French side, and one of their usual map picks, but in the short-term the lack of training together with some unneeded over-confidence caused them to drop the ball more than once. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Envy, but honestly we don't believe that their real-world edge is higher than just a 55/45, so we're a bit more oriented in playing with the odds and going for a Low bet on VP, hoping to watch the Polish side setting up a decent fight as they recently did against Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/2571!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6256!$NiP!$VP!$VP!$0.5!$0.65!$-0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite amazing match, when NiP and Virtus.Pro face each other is always an amazing show, so we highly suggest to keep your eyes on this match-up. Lately NiP woke up a bit, and finally managed to setup a quite decent winning streak, even if they still have to prove themselves in extended-map pool games, however this is without doubts a good sign and if they'll manage to keep this form, we might watch the Swedes doing quite fine @ DH Cluj. On the other hand Virtus.Pro are moving here after a quite hard entry game against EnvyUs, and we can easily say that they are moving from bad to worse, (this is a just reference to them not being fans of de_dust and not really good on de_inferno), but well their current momentum is still quite strong (they're on an impressive streak too), so we're sure we'll watch the Polish side setting up a proper fight. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, but at our end we're more oriented in going Low on NiP since they always played Inferno in a really consistent way, compared to the mixed performances achieved on this map by VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2572!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6257!$VP!$Penta!$Penta!$0.65!$0.84!$-0.18999999999999995!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well not much to say, Virtus.Pro are currently the best team on de_cache, so despite Penta are for sure looking promising, we highly doubt they'll manage to offer a serious challenge to the Polish side. We need to note that recently Penta somehow managed to beat [NaVi] on this map, but honestly we don't suggest to take this result as too relevant, since NaVi played pretty bad during the whole last week. Currently Betting odds aren't really amazing, and overall we're not talking about a really rewarding game, however we find an Avg bet on VP as a quite safe pick, so we're oriented in going for it (but just skip or ICB if odds will move to 90/10).

[NaVi] vetoed it plenty of times in the past and lately they also managed to lose against Penta on it, additionally their recent short-term results aren't amazing at all, and we can easily say that this team lost a bit the right path. However TSM never excelled on de_cache too, when possible they always vetoed it too, and overall they rarely impressed on it. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of the Danes, honestly these percentages are way off since we're talking about a T1 game, so we're oriented in suggesting an ICB on NaVi in order to take advantage of the odds.

Both Fnatic and Virtus.Pro always excelled on de_train, and on this map they set up some of the most amazing shows in recent history. Early today VP looked a bit off in their entry game against Envy, but honestly D2 never been one of their best maps and the first match of the day is always a bit tricky. Usually the Polish side is way more comfortable in playing on Train, and this is arguably one of their best maps together with de_cache, so we're expecting a quite good and consistent show. On the other hand Fnatic despite they are generally quite good on Train, they always faced a lot of issues versus VP, and lately they also looked a bit more shaky than usual, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them suffering a bit against VP, in particular if the Swedes will not counter properly the VP T side. Betting odds are still quite even, and pretty fine for going with Taz &amp; friends, so our pick is a Low bet on VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2575!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6259!$TSM!$Dignitas!$TSM!$0.6!$0.84!$-0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$Not much to say, for sure TSM aren't the best Tier1 team on de_mirage, and they've vetoed it plenty of times in the short-term. However their 'average' level performance should be enough to still grab a victory over Dignitas. On the other hand, Dignitas are used to messing around Mirage, and have frequently shown some good things against T2 teams on this map. But they always failed to achieve the same results versus T1 teams. For sure the Theres no doubt the Danish derby will bring-in some extra motivation, but overall we don't believe that Pimp &amp; co. have better than 30-40% chances to manage an upset. Betting odds are already trash, so going with TSM despite the obvious advantage is kinda pointless and will not lead to any real revenue, so the best thing you can do is trying your luck with an ICB on Dignitas, and hope for an upset.

Previous to the EU/NA Winterfox roster split, under the former banner of Mythic, Devilwalk and friends demonstrated great potential. But since their player locations became their handicap, Complexity has taken advantage and won the last two contests. One was an impressive 16-0 win, and the other was more even in the coL 16-12 win just yesterday. Today's match is on de_mirage, a map neither teams has spent much time playing. So we dont expect either team to gain much benefit from the slection. Although CompLexity has slipped some in position, and are currently trying to get their game back to where it was, the continued challenges Wfx faces currently is significant enough to keep the odds greatly in favor of coL. These percentages still offer some reward to our average bet on Complexity, but a skip may be the best pick. (Unless odds get to 85/15, you could ICB on Wfx and hope for an issue-free Wfx)

Anyways, while they may have slightly improved chances in their entry game on de_mirage, we highly doubt they'll manage to take down a solid team such as Conquest on Cobblestone, one of their best maps. Betting odds are already quite bad, and they're still dropping quickly. Actually they are edging 85/15 and an Avg bet on Conquest is still an option, but if the percentages will drop to 90/10 you can skip the whole thing without regrets. Unfortunately these matches are great on paper, but are basically ruined by the fact that half of WFox are playing with 170+ ping.

Both teams are kinda inconsistent since a quite long time, lately CSGL recovered a bit their form but they are still pretty off in a wide part of the map-pool, so we're usually very careful when we talk about Bo3 games involving them. On the other hand, Reason yesterday surprisingly managed to beat SK, something not obvious at all since it was a Bo2. Overall this lineup isn't too bad and with some effort they could be able to hit Tier2. However, Reason should sport a better teamplay, while CSGL usually compensate their poor executions with aim and personal plays (but this is a quite momentum based way to play, and it doesn't work on the mid/long term). Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Polish side, but as mentioned above this is a pretty risky game, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Danes setting up a good fight, so our pick is a Low bet on Reason.

HR never really played de_dust2 exceptionally, they frequently struggled on it, even against teams several steps below their level, however today they are facing SK, for sure not the most scary opponent out there, and in particular we need to note that the Danes always vetoed Dust2 in the past months, so we're not expecting a good show from them. Betting odds are still decent for a Low bet on HR, and this is our pick, but we discourage higher bets because HR are playing with a stand-in and because D2 is always prone to surprises.
http://csgo.guru/match/2583!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6286!$Na'Vi!$Dignitas!$Na'Vi!$0.55!$0.74!$-0.18999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Really risky game, actually featuring pretty no-sense betting odds. Dignitas in the past couple of days for sure faced some issues, but we need to note that they only played against Tier1 teams, and then these results are totally legit and in-line with their current ranking. However, on de_overpass the Danes always provided quite good shows and this always been one of their best maps, so if they'll be able to pull an upset we wouldn't be surprised to watch it happening here. On the other hand [NaVi] are actually one of the most inconsistent T1 teams, and they are cruising in quite troubled waters, lately their teamplay is quite messy and worth mentioning that on Overpass they always played in a quite average way, without any real peak. Betting odds are currently extremely off, while real-world ones are quite aligned, so at our end we've no doubts about attempting an ICB/Low bet on Dignitas, since they always provided good performances on Overpass.
http://csgo.guru/match/2584!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6290!$Dignitas!$HR!$Dignitas!$0.5!$0.58!$-0.07999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite even game, generally HellRaisers are a bit better on de_mirage compared to Dignitas, however we've talking about an ESL match, so HR are playing without S1mple and this detail may play a role on a map where long-range warfare is extremely important in order to achieve entry kills. Current betting odds are kinda mixed, and honestly this is a pretty momentum-based game that can easily go both ways according to personal plays luck, so we're not surprised to see these percentages still moving a lot. Overall we're a bit more prone in giving a little edge to Dignitas since their teamplay is generally a bit better than the HR one, but we don't suggest to go with values above Low due the extremely high risk.
http://csgo.guru/match/2585!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6270!$Na'Vi!$Vexed!$Na'Vi!$0.6!$0.89!$-0.29000000000000004!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$Overall a game that will be for sure a bit more close than expected since Vexed always step up when they are facing Tier1 teams. However we're talking about a Bo3 and on the extended map-pool Natus Vincere should be able to setup a decent show without and take home a victory. Anyway, we need to note that Vexed just a week ago managed to setup a great fight against NaVi, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Polish side taking a map or forcing GuardiaN and friends into multiple Overtimes, in particular now that the Ukrainian mix is showing all their limits. Betting odds are still decent for going with NaVi, but despite we should go for an Avg bet in order to compensate the skewed percentages we're more oriented in staying Low instead, since we find Vexed always a bit unpredictable and prone in delivering upsets.
http://csgo.guru/match/2586!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6278!$VP!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.5!$0.46!$0.03999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Match of the day, and as usual a pretty great show to watch. Both Virtus.Pro and Fnatic always played de_cache in a pretty consistent way, in particular VP used to be extremely deadly on this map, and internally we're prone in considering them the best team on it. Obviously we agree that they're recent results weren't on par with their full potential, and their loss against Penta was a bit shocking, but we're quite sure we'll watch the Polish side stepping up again against Fnatic. On the other hand, JW and friends, always provided good and solid shows on Cache, they usually don't enjoy playing it as much as VP, but overall they are a really tough opponent to face, so we're pretty sure we'll watch a quite even and close game. Betting odds are still quite balanced, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on VP, with the hope to watch them playing it as they know.
http://csgo.guru/match/2587!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6272!$Titan!$TSM!$TSM!$0.4!$0.19!$0.21000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$One of the most interesting matches scheduled for today. Honestly the Bo3 format is taking away a bit of the upset potential of this game, so TSM are going to be clearly advantaged, since they are for sure more solid on the extended map-pool and way less messy and inconsistent in the executions. On the other hand, we don't feel fine in underestimating Titan, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking a map and setting up a decent show, in particular if we'll watch de_cbble or de_dust2 as maps. Betting odds are already pretty terrible, and we don't agree at all on a Tier1 match edging 85/15 percentages, so with these values going with TSM is kinda pointless despite their clear edge, and the best thing we can suggest is an ICB on Titan with the hope to watch a close match-up.
http://csgo.guru/match/2588!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6287!$SK!$Dignitas!$Dignitas!$0.4!$0.17!$0.23!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Danish derby and honestly not much to say. SK yesterday provided a kinda horrible show against Reason on de_cache, so we highly doubt we'll watch them setting up something brilliant versus Dignitas just 24h later, in particular since Cache used to be one of their usual vetoes. However, we need to remember that Dig never really excelled on this map too, but their mid level should be enough to roll over SK in relative ease. Betting odds are still decent for going Avg on Dignitas, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2590!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6303!$WinterFox!$Cloud9!$Cloud9!$0.35!$0.09!$0.26!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not a whole lot to say on this match, which is also the only NA match worth covering tonight. The best team from the North American scene, Cloud9, has been on quite a roll lately. With the exception of the suprising defeat they suffered at the Crown's Invitational against Immunity, they've been victorious in all their contests over the last five weeks. This stretch of wins includes two games versus today's opponent Winterfox. Meanwhile the divided roster composed by Wfx has had great difficulty putting together more than one random win in a row, let alone wins in general. Till they complete their move, they'll almost never perform to their full potential. But as for todays match vs C9, they'd face an uphill battle even if the lineup weren't on opposite sides of the Atlantic. As for the map, the Bo1 will go down on de_cache. Both teams are quite comfortable on Cache, but C9 has overall yielded better results here, and we don't believe Wfx will be able to offer much resistance. So our pick is an average bet on Cloud9.
http://csgo.guru/match/2591!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6307!$Titan!$Fnatic!$Titan!$0.45!$0.27!$0.18!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Quite interesting match-up, Fnatic are back on a quite good streak, and in the past few days started rolling pretty fine again. However we need to remember that in the short-term they didn't impress at all on de_train, and just a week ago they lost on it against Titan and EnvyUs (here by measure), so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them facing some issues. On the other hand, Titan are as usual kinda random and struck within a mixed series of inconsistent performances since a while, so predicting what they are going to put today isn't easy at all. Betting odds are overly skewed in favor of the Swedish side, and this is quite no-sense according to their recent results on this map, so at our end we're oriented in taking advantage of the percentages by picking an ICB on Titan.
http://csgo.guru/match/2592!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6314!$VP!$TSM!$TSM!$0.5!$0.41!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the best matches of the day, and for sure a really even match-up due the game taking place on de_mirage. Virtus.Pro as we stated many times in the past, are usually one of the best Tier1 teams on this map, and on it we watched them doing really fine plenty of times, both offline and online. So, even if usually the entry game is a bit tricky for the Polish side, we believe we'll watch them setting up a good show. On the other hand TSM never really enjoyed playing on Mirage, when possible they always vetoed it. Anyway, their level isn't so bad as may look, they are a consistent and solid team, and fully capable to mess with all the T1 teams around on every single map, so we're just talking about a pure 50/50 game. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of TSM for basically no reason, while real-world ones are just in the middle, so we don't see any reason for not taking advantage of this and going Low on VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2593!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6315!$Dignitas!$Penta!$Dignitas!$0.6!$0.75!$-0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another match on de_mirage, and again a quite balanced fight. Dignitas in the short-term played a lot on Mirage, but actually with just few relevant results, and honestly despite the hard training they never really impressed nor provided high-tier performances on this map. We can't say the same for the German side, this is arguably the best Penta map, and they always managed to show quite good things on it, even if we need to remember that the Germans are still floating within the T3 hell, so they don't face high-tier opponents at the same ratio of Dignitas, so we must be careful in evaluating these results. However, betting odds are still quite decent for a Low/ICB bet on Penta, and we believe we'll watch a quite close match, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2594!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6316!$HR!$VP!$VP!$0.45!$0.32!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not much to say, Virtus.Pro are generally better than HellRaisers on de_overpass, and they're moving here well warmed up by their entry game, however we need to remember that HR lately are really unpredictable and already managed to grab several heavy upsets, additionally since we're talking about an ESL game Dosia will play instead of S1mple, so overall we're reviewing a pretty risky game. Betting odds are still fine for going with the Polish side, and honestly we feel a bit more comfortable in going with them, but we suggest to avoid values above Low.
http://csgo.guru/match/2595!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6318!$Penta!$TSM!$TSM!$0.3!$0.12!$0.18!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well, both teams never really enjoyed Cobblestone as map, but overall the TSM level should be several steps ahead of Penta, so we don't believe we'll watch the Danes facing too many troubles. Penta rarely provided decent shows on de_cbble, and most of the times they looked pretty confused on this map, so unless they magically fixed their strats and figured out how to polish their executions, or we highly doubt we'll watch the Germans taking more than 8-10 rounds. Betting odds are already quite bad, but if you don't want to skip our pick is TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/2596!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6308!$TSM!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.5!$0.64!$-0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Much likely the best game of the day. Both teams never really excelled on de_mirage (compared to VP or Fnatic), so we're expecting a quite even match-up. Overall TSM are rolling pretty fine, and they can be easily considered the current Top-1 by Form, however we need to note that also EnvyUs are currently sporting a pretty strong momentum, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them rolling pretty fine (in particular during the CT side &amp; pistols). Anyway, despite we're basically talking about a pure 50/50 game, we're a bit more oriented in going with the Frenchmen, in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages, so our pick is a Low bet on EnvyUs.
http://csgo.guru/match/2599!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6305!$G2!$HR!$G2!$0.45!$0.43!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is going to be a quite amazing Tier2 match to watch. Both HellRaisers and Gamers2 in the short-term provided quite good performances on de_cache, so we're expecting an incredibly even fight. About HR we can easily say that this one of their best maps, and on it they already managed to take down several big names, for sure having Dosia instead of S1mple may play a role, but overall we believe they are joining this game as favorite. About Gamers2 we need to note that both Maikelele and Dennis are just back from Germany, and then we don't expect them to shine too much, however we also have to remember that G2 already faced HR just a couple of weeks ago on the same map, and they managed to beat them during OT, so we don't suggest to underestimate ScreaM and friends. Betting odds are quite skewed in favor of HR, while real-world ones are pretty even, but honestly despite a Low bet on G2 is for sure legit we're a mit more oriented in jumping on the HR train. So our pick is a Low+ bet on HR.
http://csgo.guru/match/2601!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6304!$G2!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.28!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Well, not an obvious match as may look at first sight. Fnatic during the past month started vetoing de_inferno a lot, way more than usual, despite previously they always provided good shows on it. We're not sure about the reason behind this decision, but we wouldn't be surprised to know that this is happening in order to don't provide references prior a Major. On the other hand, Gamers2 avoided this map on a regular basis for a quite long time, and just recently they started playing it again, so despite we're talking about a really inconsistent mix, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them providing a good fight (in particular if Fnatic won't try too hard). Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of Fnatic, so we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB on G2.
http://csgo.guru/match/2604!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6324!$LG!$coL!$null!$0.5!$0.59!$-0.08999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not a great deal to talk about when these two play. Luminosity has been playing pretty well lately, winning the matches they should would win, and losing to the top tier teams. That pattern is mostly adhered to in their matches against Complexity, winning 4 out of the last 5 maps. Complexity on the other hand, have been very inconsistent and unable to gain any momentum. However we need to note that LG are currently playing from EU, so even if the Faceit bo1 will be played on de_inferno, which coL has only played a few times, we believe that the ping disadvantage will make this match kinda even. Betting odds favor Luminosity, but honestly we'rea bit concerned by the ping issues, so we're a bit more oriented in going Low- on coL.
http://csgo.guru/match/2605!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6325!$Cloud9!$Liquid!$null!$0.55!$0.55!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row against each other, and here we'll enjoy quite a balanced show. On de_cache both teams have always offered good performances. In particular, Cloud9 has managed to beat multiple EU teams on it, so we're pretty sure they'll manage to put up good results. However, we need to note that Liquid aren't coming into this contest as underdogs, especially considering they are the 2nd most deadly team on de_cache within the NA scene, so we're expecting some serious fight from Hiko and friends. And honestly we wouldn't be surprised to watch them find an upset. Betting odds are a bit skewed in favor of C9, but at our end we're a bit more oriented in attempting a Low bet on Liquid, since we believe we'll watch a pretty even match-up.
http://csgo.guru/match/2608!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6340!$Vexed!$SK!$null!$0.5!$0.47!$0.030000000000000027!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Well not much to say, both teams are on a quite terrible slump, and in the short-term they collected a quite impressive amount of fails. Additionally SK are currently playing with a random stand-in since K0nfig just left the team, and this for sure makes things even worse. Vexed and SK already faced each other in a Bo3 just a week ago, and SK managed to take the upper hand, but their performance was far from perfect and the game it self quite close. Betting odds are currently in favor of SK, but honestly we're talking about a pretty random game that can easily go both ways without following any pattern, so we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Vexed (due the more rewarding percentages) and keep fingers crossed.
http://csgo.guru/match/2609!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6326!$G2!$Titan!$G2!$0.45!$0.39!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite interesting game since yesterday Titan surprisingly managed to roll over EnvyUs on de_dust2 in a quite impressive fashion. Overall we can say that both teams are kinda inconsistent, but actually the French side is floating a bit higher, and looks like they are finally capable to deal with most of the other T1 teams again. On the other hand Gamers2 in the short-term never really displayed a solid way to play, and their executions are still quite off. However, despite they are fully capable to mess with high-ranked T2 teams, they rarely managed to take the upper hand against T1 opponents, in particular on Dust2. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Titan, and we agree with this, but right now these percentages are for sure a bit too skewed for our taste, while real-world odds are more around 55/45-60/40, so we're a bit more oriented in attempting a Low- bet on G2, with the hope to don't watch them choking in the late game as they did a week ago versus TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/2611!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6327!$EnVyUs!$Fnatic!$EnVyUs!$0.5!$0.6!$-0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the best match-ups of the day. EnvyUs and Fnatic will face each other one more time on de_train, last week on the same map, the Frenchmen managed to roll over the Swedes with an impressive 16-3 score, a quite stunning result that underlined even further the "nay" moment that the Fnatic roster is currently facing. However, we cannot say that Envy are a powerhouse on Train, lately they for sure provided good results on it, but they never had a good history about playing it well (they vetoed it for months), on the other hand Fnatic used to be quite fine on it during mid-summer, but lately they are collecting mistakes over mistakes, and actually we don't find them a really reliable pick. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of EnvyUs, and we're prone in agreeing with this, since we're not prone in believing in Fnatic too much when comes to de_train, so our pick is a Low bet on the French side.
http://csgo.guru/match/2612!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6342!$mouz!$VP!$null!$0.4!$0.41!$-0.009999999999999953!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Interesting match, and for sure a game that could be way closer than expected. As we stated many times already, Virtus.Pro never enjoyed too much playing on de_dust2, and despite lately they showed decent things, they are still pretty unreliable and a bit random on it. On the other hand, Mousesports are a bit more used in playing D2, and for a quite long time it was one of their usual picks and yesterday they put up a great show vs TSM, however we need to note that overall they started dropping the ball a bit, and their form is currently a bit lower than during September, so even in maps where they used to be good they started having some issues. Betting odds are currently in favor of VP, but as usual we're not prone in putting too much faith in the Polish side during their entry game, so we are a bit more oriented in attempting a Low bet on Mouz.
http://csgo.guru/match/2614!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6338!$Dignitas!$FSid3!$Dignitas!$0.6!$0.66!$-0.06000000000000005!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an obvious game as may look at first sight. Dignitas are for sure trending and they are currently the best ranked team within Tier2, and in the short-term they didn't face any real issue in rolling over T2 opponents (but they faced huge ones in messing with T1 teams), so they are for sure stepping in this Bo3 as favored. Additionally their recent roster changes (Tenzki replaced Schneider) didn't really affect the team in any relevant (negative) way. On the other hand, we don't suggest to underestimate FlipSid3, they don't sport an huge firepower but they are smart and well organized, so you shouldn't be surprised to watch them taking a map and setup a good fight overall (in particular if we'll see de_cbble or de_mirage as maps). Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Dingitas, and this is correct, but honestly these percentages are way too skewed, while real ones are more around 60-40. At our end we wouldn't be surprised to watch an upset since CIS teams always care a lot about SLTV matches, so our pick is a Low bet on Fsid3.
http://csgo.guru/match/2615!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6328!$TSM!$VP!$VP!$0.55!$0.68!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$What a great match! Both Virtus.Pro and TSM always played de_overpass in a great way, in particular the Danes are currently sitting on a stunning 15 games winning streak, and they aren't losing on this map since late August. Currently TSM is for sure the team sporting the stronger momentum, they are well trained, focused and in particular on their usual picks a step below most of the other Tier1 opponents. So they are obviously favored for taking this game too. On the other hand VP experienced a quite shaky week, and even if usually they are one of the most consistent teams on Overpass, we are a bit unsure regarding their current form, since they are looking a bit tired compared to the Danish side. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of TSM, and we kinda agree, for sure percentages aren't really exceptional but honestly their form seems to be higher, so our pick is a Low bet on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/2616!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6329!$G2!$NiP!$NiP!$0.4!$0.4!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Both teams always played de_cache in a pretty solid way. This is one of the few maps where Gamers2 are actually reliable and not inconsistent as hell, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch Maikelele and friends setting up a decent show. On the other hand NiP in the short-term provided a couple of really great shows by beating both Fnatic and TSM on Cache, for sure a quite noticeable performance. Overall we find the NiP momentum stronger, and currently Betting odds aren't extremely skewed yet, so we find a Low+ bet on Ninjas a quite suitable option.
http://csgo.guru/match/2618!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6330!$Fnatic!$HR!$Fnatic!$0.6!$0.71!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$take down Tier1 teams such as EnvyUs and NiP, and this is one of the maps where they are extremely dangerous. Additionally, this is a Faceit game, so S1mple will play, adding for sure a good extra to the upset chances. On the other hand, for Fnatic this is the 2nd game in a row on Cobblestone, so they are moving here already well warmed up As we stated for the previous game too, they are usually quite good on this map, but we need to note that lately they started dropping the ball a bit, and they aren't reliable as they used to be in mid-summer. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of the Swedes, but honestly these percentages are way off, while in reality we're looking into a quite close game, so our pick is a Low bet on HR.
http://csgo.guru/match/2622!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6352!$Liquid!$Cloud9!$Liquid!$0.5!$0.43!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row against each other after yesterday's schedule conflict, and once more we'll enjoy quite a balanced show. On de_cbble both teams have always offered mostly consistenet performances. In particular, Liquid has had some strong outings vs EU teams on it, so we're pretty sure they'll manage to put up good results. However, we need to note that Liquid aren't coming into this contest as underdogs, especially considering they managed a dominant performance in last night's 16-6 over Cloud9, so again we're expecting some serious fight from Hiko and friends. And honestly we wouldn't be surprised to watch them find an upset. Betting odds are a bit skewed in favor of C9, but this is certainly a pure 50/50 match, so at our end we're a bit more oriented in attempting a Low bet on Liquid for the higher reward, since we believe we'll watch a pretty even match-up.
http://csgo.guru/match/2626!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6358!$Vexed!$E-Frag!$E-Frag!$0.5!$0.24!$0.26!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Quite useless game since E-Frag are basically already qualified for Playoffs, and winning or losing this match will not provide them any benefit, on the other hand, the chances for Vexed to move through the Groupstage are basically none, so we're mostly talking about a match-up played just for the glory. Yesterday E-Frag already faced Vexed in a GO:CL Bo3 and the Bulgarian side managed to take home a 2-0 victory, but honestly according to the previously mentioned factors we don't think that this game is far away from just a pure 50/50. Betting odds are overly skewed in favor of E-Frag for absolutely no reason, while in reality we'll watch a pretty random game, so our pick is an ICB on Vexed in order to take advantage of the sweet percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2627!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6359!$Penta!$VP!$VP!$0.3!$0.13!$0.16999999999999998!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say. Penta basically never played on de_train before, and this is one of their usual veto maps, while on the other hand Virtus.Pro always played it on a regular basis and with success, so we don't think we'll watch any surprise. The Polish side should be able to roll over the Germans without particular issues, so our pick is an Average bet on VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2628!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6360!$NiP!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.55!$0.61!$-0.05999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Today we'll enjoy NiP vs Natus Vincere twice in a row, and here we're reviewing the first match-up, taking place on de_inferno. Inferno is generally a map in favor of the Swedes, they always played it decently, and in the past weeks they also managed to regain their form a bit, so currently they are sporting a quite solid momentum. On the other hand NaVi used to be quite decent on this map too, but lately they started doing plenty of mistakes, and most of their executions are happening not in sync at all, this caused them to lose against T2 opponents a couple of times already. Overall we don't really feel fine in going with them, even if we believe that there are chances to watch GuardiaN and friends bouncing back soon. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ bet on NiP, so this is our pick too.
http://csgo.guru/match/2629!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6361!$Na'Vi!$NiP!$Na'Vi!$0.55!$0.66!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for both teams, and here the map is de_overpass. Generally Natus Vincere are quite decent on this map and unlike most of the T1 teams, they always favored it over Cbble. As we stated in the previous match too, currently they are for sure a bit in a slump, but after-all we're talking about one of their best maps, so we expect them to perform way better on Overpass compared to Inferno. Actually we're pretty sure we'll watch a close game and we are also prone in giving a little edge to GuardiaN and friends. About NiP, they never really enjoyed playing on this map, and they vetoed it plenty of times in the past Quarter, but honestly they always managed to show decent things, even without playing it on a regular basis, so we don't think they'll do too bad. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of NaVi, and we agree on this, but we cannot agree on the percentages and we don't suggest to jump on the hype train, since we're still talking about a kinda risky and even game. At our end we're a bit more prone in taking advantage of the skewed odds and go for a little bet on NiP.

[SK] are in a slump since a quite long while, and early this week they lost the services of K0nfig, who stepped out from the roster. On Train they probably played a bit more than Penta, but currently their team status is really messy and their motivation is even worse. On the other hand Penta always vetoed Train on a consistent basis, and today they're playing here mostly for training purposes than anything else, overall they are for sure the better team but we don't suggest to waste too much stuff in a game between a couple of pretty low-tier &amp; random teams. Betting odds are still pretty even, and honestly not really appealing, our pick is a Low- bet on Penta, but you should consider a plain skip too.
http://csgo.guru/match/2631!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6364!$Fnatic!$TSM!$Fnatic!$0.5!$0.42!$0.08000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Probably the best game scheduled for today. Both TSM and Fnatic always showed great things on de_mirage, so we're expecting a pretty even game mostly decided by personal plays and by how much the sides want to show in a match coming up so close to the next Major. In the short-term TSM probably showed slightly better things on this map, while Fnatic looked a bit in a slump and had to sweat more than usual for taking home their matches. Anyway as mentioned above, we don't believe that two teams favored for taking a victory @ DH Cluj will show all their beauty with the clock so close to the event, so we're more oriented in playing the odds and go for a Low bet on Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/2632!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6366!$Titan!$SK!$Titan!$0.7!$0.85!$-0.15000000000000002!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well we aren't expecting huge surprises from this game. Titan always played de_cache in a pretty consistent way and with successful results also versus the rest of Tier1 teams, so we don't think they'll sweat too much against SK. On the other hand the Danes are playing with a stand-in, as mentioned in their previous game too, and in the past months they vetoed Cache on a regular basis, so we don't expect them to put up an huge fight. Betting odds are obviously in favor of Titan, and at our end we're oriented in picking an Average bet on Titan.
http://csgo.guru/match/2633!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6369!$NME!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.4!$0.05!$0.35000000000000003!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Not much to say since Betting odds have already turned to trash, however this is the StarSeries NA opener. And since we're talking about a Bo3, we highly doubt we'll watch Liquid have any trouble in taking home the victory. Enemy have for sure improved over the short-term, and they've had pretty consistent performances within the NA T2. However, beating one of the Top3 NA teams is a whole different story and currently well above their current level. As mentioned above, percentages are pretty off and not really profitable, so you can either go High on Liquid or just skip the whole thing. In our opinion, going for a skip is the best option since we're talking about 90/10 values, and an ICB on NME in bo3 here is out of the question.
http://csgo.guru/match/2635!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6370!$CLG!$Conquest!$null!$0.55!$0.53!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the most interesting game scheduled for this North American evening. We already talked about the CLG situation in their previous match-up, so we'll just add that usually they are a bit more consistent in Bo3 games opposed to the one and done Bo1s. With that in mind, we do expect them to put up a decent fight, despite their recent struggles suffered against teams sporting an aggressive playstyle. On the other hand, Conquest managed to recover from their own little slump fairly well. In the process, they switched Ryx for Stanislaw (not an huge change, so don't be worried about it). Currently they are rolling on a pretty promising streak, and yesterday they even managed to beat Cloud9 as well, and with a pretty impressive score. Needless-to-say, we're sure they'll jump here pretty pumped up. As for maps, there are good chances to see: de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_cbble. If should the veto go as so, CLG should be slightly advantaged on Cobblestone, while Conquest will likely take Overpass, leaving Dust2 which is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of CLG, but with respect to the strong Conquest momentum we're more inclined to viewing this game as a purely balanced contest. So our pick is a Low bet on Conquest, in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2638!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6367!$CLG!$coL!$coL!$0.6!$0.78!$-0.18000000000000005!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$A pretty interesting game here. CLG have been in a bit in a slump for awhile now, and in the past weeks they suffered at the expense of the rise of Liquid. Actually, they have strayed rather from their mid-summer form, when they were securely sitting within the NA Top3 and showing some really promising things. Meanwhile, their opponents CompLexity, are a pretty inconsistent opponent, and even if CLG aren't playing with their strongest momentum anymore, they should be able to prevail in a Bo3. Even though we wouldn't be surprised to watch them drop a map in the process. About the veto, chances are good to watch de_cache, de_cbble and de_dust2 as the maps. If it goes so, CLG should be able to grab both Cache and Cobblestone, while Dust2 with some luck may go to coL. Betting odds are still decent for going Average on CLG, so we're oriented in taking this path as well.
http://csgo.guru/match/2639!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6378!$CSGL!$FSid3!$FSid3!$0.45!$0.3!$0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The only decent match scheduled for today, and honestly not an huge show. Both teams are struggling since a while, CSGL are currently one of the most inconsistent teams out there, and even if lately they managed to hit a decent streak they are still extremely unreliable and very momentum based, in particular in games featuring an extended map pool (since for some reason the Polish side keeps training just a bunch of maps). On the other hand, FlipSid3 are a bit more solid team-wise, but they really lack of firepower and clutch capabilities, and this makes them an easy target for top ranked Tier2 teams and Tier1 ones. Talking about the current game, there are pretty high chances to watch: de_mirage, de_overpass and de_train. These teams already faced plenty of times in the short-term, and generally Fsid3 always showed a slightly better things in all the aforementioned maps, so we're prone in giving them a fair edge in real-world odds. Betting percentages, are widely trending in favor of the Ukrainian/Russian mix, and we kinda agree on this vision, however we find the current values a bit too extreme and hyped, while we'll likely watch a quite close game that will hit all the 3 maps, so we're a bit more oriented in attempting an ICB/Low bet on the CSGL roulette, with the hope to see the Polish side a bit more in form than during their past shows.
http://csgo.guru/match/2640!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6381!$HR!$SK!$SK!$0.6!$0.73!$-0.13!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$well, lately HellRaisers are cruising into quite troubled waters, and all the issues related to S1mple and his contract are for sure casting some shadows on the team despite the really promising results achieved in the short-term. However, here we're talking about an ESL game, so the Ukrainian young talent wasn't allowed to play anyway, and then HR are relying on the usual random stand-in (lately Dosia, but not confirmed for today yet). On the other hand SK are experiencing troubles since a quite long while, and they're playing with a sub too, since K0nfig left them just a week ago. Talking about the game it self, generally HR are quite decent on de_mirage, and they should be able to roll over SK without too many issues, so our pick is a Low+/Avg- bet on HR.
http://csgo.guru/match/2641!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6382!$NiP!$Titan!$Titan!$0.5!$0.61!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$First big match of the day, both teams will attend DH Cluj in just a bunch of days, and they are also placed within the same Group, so we highly doubt we'll watch them showing too much, and we'll very likely see these rosters playing a bit pug-like. Additionally de_dust2 is always a map prone to upsets, so you shouldn't be surprised to watch Titan setting up a good fight, in particular since they always provided good shows on it, even without fielding super-smart strats. About NiP, they already started playing with their cards well covered (it was really clear in their last games vs NaVi), so we don't find the Swedes a really reliable option. Betting odds are currently totally no-sense, and since we're talking about a pure 50/50 game we have no doubts in going for a Low bet on Titan in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2642!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6383!$SK!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.4!$0.14!$0.26!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Second match in a row on de_mirage for SK, and just like the previous game we don't have much faith in the Danes according to their latest and quite disappointing results, however playing the same map twice in a day may lead to slightly better performances in this game compared to the entry one. Honestly not much to say, Natus Vincere are clearly advantaged, and they always provided solid shows on Mirage, so they should be able to take home a victory in relative ease, even without setting up their very best. Betting odds are already pretty horrible and not really rewarding, so even if our pick is NaVi we highly suggest to evaluate a skip too.
http://csgo.guru/match/2643!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6384!$VP!$SK!$VP!$0.6!$0.75!$-0.15000000000000002!$LOW RISK!$LOW BET!$Well, at our end we never really enjoyed the Virtus.Pro playstyle on de_cbble, we find it quite weird and not really suitable for countering the long-range based strats of most of the other Tier1 teams. However, here we're not talking about a top-tier game, nor we're referring to an opponent famous for playing Cobblestone in a consistent way. SK never really managed to put up amazing shows on this map, and they always favored Overpass over it, so we don't believe we'll watch the Danes taking more than about 10 rounds. Just like the previous match, the Betting odds are already quite terrible and not rewarding at all, so our pick is VP, but you should keep an eye on the percentages and evaluate a skip if they fall to 90/10.
http://csgo.guru/match/2644!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6391!$VP!$TSM!$TSM!$0.5!$0.44!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite epic match between two teams that always provided great shows on de_overpass. Early this week Virtus.Pro managed to take the upper hand against TSM in their FaceIt game taking place on the same map; but as we mentioned for the other T1 matches scheduled for today, we suggest to be very cautious in these high-tier match-ups since we're just few days away from DH Cluj, so most of the T1 rosters will not spoiler their strats in pointless online games. In particular since we're talking about a couple of teams with high chances to hit the Mahor Grand Final. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of TSM, but we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 match, so we suggest to go Low on VP in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2645!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6392!$TSM!$EnVyUs!$TSM!$0.5!$0.46!$0.03999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last EU game of the day, and just another great match-up involving a couple of extremely high ranked Tier1 teams. Just like the previously covered T1 games, this match is following the same pattern, so don't expect outstanding performances from both sides in online games, since we're talking about teams favored for reaching the DH Cluj Semis next weekend. On de_inferno both sides always provided quite solid results, so we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game that can easily go both ways. Betting odds are still pretty balanced and the match it self is going to be pretty random. At our end we're a bit more prone in going Low on Envy since we believe that their raw firepower is higher (if we stripe the contenders of their strats), but be careful and avoid huge values.
http://csgo.guru/match/2651!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6393!$Cloud9!$CLG!$CLG!$0.55!$0.58!$-0.029999999999999916!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Here we have one the better matches on tonight's NA schedule. As stated in the last match, Cloud9 is looking to get back on track as Cluj looms nearby. Following their first match tonight vs NME, Cloud9 they'll rest for a bit before meeting a more appropriate T2 opponent to help practice for DH. For a little while CLG was playing at a high level, taking some convincing wins vs NA &amp; EU T2-3 teams. But recently they too haven't been playing to their potential. In particular when the opposition comes at them with an aggressive playstyle. Cloud9 might not neccessarily have an aggressive style, but we're expecting to see an aggressive C9 this evening. As for the map, de_Mirage will host these two, which is good practice for C9 for the extended map pool as they often veto it. Whereas CLG usually puts up some good games here, but their recent streakiness yeilded some less favorable outcomes. Regardless, we still feel they have a slight edge here, and that partially places real-world odds more blanaced than the betting odds. Though we're expecting a pretty close match, we do feel Cloud9 should be able to take the victory, so our pick is a Low bet on Skadoodle and friends.
http://csgo.guru/match/2652!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6394!$CLG!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.45!$0.39!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last North American match of the day, and for sure quite an exciting match-up. Lately Liquid have certainly been doing better than CLG, and on a large portion of the map-pool they've showed pretty good things. However, today we're talking about a game taking place on de_train and things are a bit more complex. Liquid never focused too much on Train. Generally they play decently there, but they're still far from perfect so this is a map where we wouldn't be surprised to watch an upset. On the other hand, CLG have increased their training on this map significantly more in the past months. Even though they are currently in the middle of a long streak of mixed results, we actually believe that Tarik and the gang have a serious chance to bounce back in this game. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Liquid, and they for sure have a tiny edge, but we're not talking about an extremely relevant one, while real-world percentages are way closer so this match is going to be pretty risky. At our end we're a bit more oriented in playing the odds, and drop a Low bet on CLG in order to take advantage of the skewed odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/2654!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6402!$HR!$Titan!$HR!$0.45!$0.37!$0.08000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$A pretty hard game to predict since HellRaisers are currently facing quite serious lineup troubles (after a really promising 3 weeks), and yesterday they managed to lose by measure against SK, for sure not the most relevant team out there (but after all they were playing with two stand-ins). Historically HR always provided quite good shows on de_cache, and with just a single sub (Schneider) they could be able to bounce back and provide some issues to Titan. On the other hand, the French/Belgian side never provided consistent results on Cache, and they frequently chocked at it, in particular during the late game, additionally we doubt they'll spoil too much prior DH Cluj, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a close game. Betting odds are currently widely skewed in favor of Titan, while real-world ones are more around 40/60, so at our end we're a bit more oriented in going Low on the HR roulette, with the hope to watch them a bit more on-point than yesterday.
http://csgo.guru/match/2655!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6403!$CSGL!$TSM!$null!$0.4!$0.06!$0.34!$LOW RISK!$HIGH BET!$Well, not much to say, as we stated for many Tier1 teams already, we doubt we'll watch TSM showing their very best, but honestly we're pretty sure that their 'Average' is enough for rolling over CSGL without many issues, additionally the Bo2 format adds an 'extra layer' of protection since we highly doubt we'll watch the Danes losing two maps in a row. Overall we're talking about a quite safe game, and in the worst case we'll watch just a Tie. Unfortunately betting odds are already trash, and betting here is a plain wast of time since the percentages are so skewed that you'll win cents even by going with a max bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/2656!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6404!$HR!$Penta!$Penta!$0.55!$0.73!$-0.17999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We already wrote about the HellRaisers roster issues in their entry game, so we'll not repeat the whole thing again. Here, since the map is de_dust2 we just want to add that HR always played pretty well on it, and according to the fact that we're not talking about a very technical map we don't think that playing with Schneider as stand-in will cause them any relevant issue. On the other hand Penta are for sure slightly advantaged teamplay-wise, but honestly we doubt we'll watch the Germans setting up a great fight according to the shaky results they achieved on this map in the short-term (additionally they looked pretty out of focus during the past few days). Betting odds are still decent for going Low on HR, and this is our pick too.
http://csgo.guru/match/2657!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6405!$Na'Vi!$HR!$Na'Vi!$0.6!$0.74!$-0.14!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Both teams used to be quite on point on de_train. In the short-term HellRaisers provided quite outstanding results on it, but currently (as we already mentioned) they are facing roster issues, and playing with a stand-in in a map where timings and executions are really important is not going to be an easy task at all. On the other hand, Natus Vincere will likely keep a low-profile, since this is one of their battle horses, and we're pretty sure they will not provide too many references in a match taking place pretty near to the next Major. Betting odds are currently widely skewed in favor of NaVi, and we agree on this trend since we find them the favorite team too, but honestly we don't believe that percentages should be so skewed, in particular since NaVi overlooked this kind of games plenty of times. So despite we consider NaVi as favorite we're more oriented in going with an ICB on HR.

Natus Vincere are historically pretty good on de_mirage, and it's surely one of the few maps where they always been quite aligned with the rest of Tier1 teams. On the other hand, Mousesports used to be quite good too, overall they played it a bit less compared to Edward and friends, but always with quite promising results. As we mentioned for the previous Bo1s, we're not expecting to watch an extremely great game, but mostly two teams 'pugging' and saving their best stuff for the upcoming Major, and this shouldn't surprise you at all since de_mirage is one of the crucial maps and an usual pick during most of the high-end matches. Betting odds are trending in favor of NaVi, but honestly we find this game a quite balanced one, in particular if both teams will play it mostly strats-less, so we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Mouz.

The German side never really impressed on this map, and they consistently vetoed it (when possible), so we don't believe they'll manage to take more than 8-10 rounds. However Betting Odds are already quite bad, and with percentages edging the 90/10 we don't really suggest to waste time on this game, but if you want to pick a side anyway going with Fnatic should be kinda safe.

EnvyUs never enjoyed too much playing on de_overpass, they always vetoed it on a consistent basis, and they never really provided super-duper shows on this map. On the other hand Mousesports for sure played it a bit more and with promising results, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them hitting an upset since their fellow countrymen Penta, already managed to achieve that just a week ago (so prior the pre-Major mindset, and with cards still partially uncovered). However, with both teams involved in a Major guessing who will give all and who will keep their best for the upcoming games isn't really easy, at our end we're oriented in considering this game as a pure 50/50 and we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Mouz due the slightly more rewarding percentages.

DreamHack Cluj-Napoca opening match and a game that may be a bit closer than expected. Fnatic are without doubts the huge favorites of Group A, they don't have any real contender and they should be able to move ahead in relative ease. The Swedes don't need any real presentation, they are moving here as the the defending champions, but we need to remember that in the short-term they dropped the ball a little, and currently their level should be slightly below both TSM and EnvyUs. On the other hand, Vexed are playing their 2nd Major in a row, surely a remarkable achievement for a Tier2 team, the Polish side never really played exceptionally online and within their own Tier, but this roster has the ability to put-up great shows when they have to face Tier1 opponents, so even if probably we'll very likely watch Fnatic taking home a victory and moving to the decider match we wouldn't be surprised to watch Vexed setting up a decent fight. Betting odds are already widely skewed, and not really profitable, so even if our pick is Fnatic we suggest to bet here only if you need to move items to your Lounge inventory.

As we mentioned in our preview too, Cloud9 lately slowed their run a bit, and we can safely say they stopped being the monsters that during mid-summer scared most of the EU Tier1 teams. Their latest Lan performances have been widely below their 2nd Quarter level, and in particular during the Crown's Invitational they showed all their lack of focus and issues. However, Luminosity have some limits too, and frequently their executions are quite messy (and even if enjoyable to watch) they don't lead to any solid result, so at our end we are oriented in categorizing this game as a pure 50/50 one. Current betting odds are trending in favor of C9, but these values are way too skewed, so we're more oriented in going low on LG with the hope to watch the Brazilian side setting up something consistent.

For sure the Bo1 format brings in some randomness, but as we stated in our event preview, we highly doubt we'll watch FlipSid3 (currently playing with Bondik as single 'playmaker') shutting down the Danes, in particular if we'll watch de_overpass or de_train as map. Betting odds are already extremely skewed, and just like Fnatic - Vexed reviewed early, this is not a great game to bet-on due the extremely low margin of profit. Overall our pick is obviously TSM, but again we suggest to bet here only if you need to transfer items into Lounge bots.

As we stated early today in our DH Cluj Groups overview both teams will very likely put up a quite good fight. Gamers2 are probably a slightly bit more on-point aim wise, but on the other hand Mousesports are a better All-around team, featuring a good firepower together with a wide map-pool knowledge. If the Germans will manage to handle the veto smartly we'll very likely watch them moving ahead in facing TSM tomorrow. However evaluating the G2 performances isn't easy at all, in the short-term they provided a wide series of mixed results, and they don't follow any real pattern or logic, overall they are an extremely momentum based team, and if they'll step into this game with the right mindset they have serious chances to provide an upset. Betting odds are currently a bit mixed too, and quite decent for going with both sides, at our end we're oriented in considering this game as a pure 50/50 one, but out of the two contenders we've a bit more faith in Mouz due their more logical gameplay.

Liquid are currently on a really impressive streak, they outplayed every single North American team during the past month, and in the last Quarter they also managed to collect a quite good international experience, so they are for sure the most tricky North American team to face, and honestly the only one capable to hit an upset. Virtus.Pro on the other hand played the last few weeks with their cards well covered, they didn't spoil too much of their Major strats yet, and previously they had several highs and lows, highs mostly on Lan while lows mostly in the 'relaxed' weeks when winning wasn't really crucial. However, worth mentioning that VP always experienced issues in their entry games, and usually they start quite slowly in the GroupStage, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a game closer than expected, in particular since Liquid is a team who prefers quick gameplay and fast strats, so there is for sure a decent upset-potential. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of VP, and we agree on this, but these percentages are way too skewed (and quite no-sense for a Lan game), so our pick is an ICB on Liquid in order to take advantage of the more rewarding odds.

As we already mentioned in our Group C preview NiP are moving to this game after a week where they mostly kept their aces covered. But before the last few days, the Swedes managed to display interesting things, and honestly we truly believe that joining this Major without any real large-scale plan may help them in better managing the pressure, and then there are good chances to watch F0rest and friends bouncing back. However, Titan are not going to be an easy opponent to face, the French/Belgian side improved a lot during the last Quarter, and by adding Scream they managed to enhance even further their fire-power, so even if they are still quite inconsistent (in particular in the late game) we're still talking about a team fully capable to play on par with the rest of Tier1 teams in their group, and we're sure they'll try to grab a ticket for Playoffs till the very end. Betting odds are still pretty even, but at our end we're a bit more prone in giving a little edge to NiP, since we believe they are playing their cards smartly, so our pick is a Low bet on NiP.

Just like TSM also EnvyUs are stepping into this Major as huge favored, but unlike the Danes they are a bit more vulnerable in Bo1 games, and in the past weeks we frequently watched the Frenchmen underestimating most of their online opponents (and this resulted in several upsets). Obviously their mindset for Lan games is generally different, but honestly they are not famous for humbleness, so underestimating a team like Dignitas during a Major could be an huge mistake. However, on the other hand we don't have much faith on Dig, they always looked extremely consistent within the Tier2, but they are still having issues in turning their playstyle into something less schematic and more suitable for Tier1 fights. Betting odds are already trash, so even if Envy are clearly favored we don't really suggest to waste your time in betting here, unless you need to move items to your Lounge wallet.

However, in their entry game GuardiaN and friends aren't facing the most scary team out there, and CLG are probably in a way more serious slump compared to NaVi. CLG, as team suffered a lot the rise of Liquid, and during the past quarter they seriously struggled in offering an organized gameplay and something not fully focused on personal plays, so we don't believe we'll watch them doing extremely fine if NaVi will handle the match and the veto smartly. Betting odds are still pretty decent for going Low on NaVi, and this is our pick too, but honestly we don't suggest to risk higher values since we're talking about a couple of teams that lately are kinda unpredictable.

Yesterday Vexed managed to scare Fnatic a bit thanks to a start with the pedal to the metal on de_cbble, then the Swedes woke up and took home a victory, but without any doubts the Polish side set up a quite good show, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them giving all today as well, in particular since Cloud9 are looking a bit shaky. On the other hand, the North Americans faced serious issues in dealing with Luminosity, despite they were playing on a map where they used to be quite on-point. However, they must win this game if they want to avoid the shame to go home after just a couple of games. Betting odds are still quite decent, so at our end we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Cloud9, mostly because we don't believe they'll give up, but honestly we'll watch a close match, in particular if Vexed will manage to force C9 on a 'new' map (cbble/ovp/train).
http://csgo.guru/match/2683!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6465!$FSid3!$mouz!$mouz!$0.45!$0.31!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Yesterday things went a bit unexpectedly for the German side, most of us were expecting a pretty close game against Gamers2, but it didn't go so, mostly due a quite unlucky veto that condemned Mousesports to play on de_inferno, not one of their favorite picks and a map where they always provided kinda average/low performances. However, we still believe that they are the most balanced T2 team in Group B, and if they'll manage to hit the Bo3 decider they have serious chances to grab a ticket for Playoffs. On the other hand FlipSid3 kinda shared a quite unlucky veto, but honestly their chances were quite low anyway since their opponents were TSM, actually the top-trending team in the world. Overall we're talking about a quite even game, Mouz should have a little edge due the slightly higher firepower, but as usual during these Bo1s the veto will make an huge difference, and predicting how it'll go is pretty hard, in our opinion there are good chances to see de_cache, and if it goes so we're more oriented in going Low on Mouz.
http://csgo.guru/match/2684!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6461!$Liquid!$NiP!$NiP!$0.5!$0.33!$0.16999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Must watch game, and one of the greatest match-ups we'll enjoy today. NiP yesterday failed pretty hard against Titan, despite historically de_cbble used to be a map where the Swedes always managed to setup good things, in particular on Lan. However, they played a plain terrible T side, and when you step into the half-time with a score around 13-2 means that you screwed up things (given that Cobblestone is a CT sided map, the right score for an even match is usually 10-5). On the other hand Liquid managed to put up an hell of a fight against VP, and they dropped the ball only during the Overtime, honestly we believe that with a bit more focus and cold blood they could have taken home a great victory, according to the several match-points they wasted. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of NiP, but here we're talking about a pure 50/50 game, and with a smart veto Hiko and friends could be able to deliver an upset, so we don't see any reason for not taking advantage of the skewed percentages by going Low on Liquid.
http://csgo.guru/match/2685!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6459!$Fnatic!$LG!$LG!$0.55!$0.84!$-0.2899999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Extremely interesting game, and potentially a quite profitable one too. Fnatic are moving to this game after a not so convincingly performance against Vexed, despite their victory we still have serious concerns regarding how they managed the first half of that game, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them struggling even more against Luminosity, in particular if they'll end playing on de_dust2. On the other hand LG, rolled over Cloud9 in relative ease, and overall they looked well focused and quite on point with their executions, so if Fnatic will leave them enough operating space during the early game there are good chances to watch them taking advantage of it in order to close the match early. Betting odds are extremely skewed in favor of Fnatic, while real-world percentages are more aligned to the middle, with just a little edge in favor of the Swedes, so at our end we've no doubts about picking an ICB on Luminosity.
http://csgo.guru/match/2686!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6460!$G2!$TSM!$TSM!$0.4!$0.17!$0.23!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$On paper a quite enjoyable match to watch, Gamers2 yesterday proved to be quite dangerous when stars align, but honestly we doubt we'll watch TSM missing their chance to qualify to playoffs as 1st of their Group, so despite there is definitively room for a close game (in particular if the veto will go in favor of a classic map, such as Dust2) the odds are obviously skewed in favor of the Danes. According to this, the current percentages aren't really profitable for going with TSM, and even if we believe they'll roll over Maikelele and friends, we're a bit more oriented in playing the odds and attempt an ICB on G2. Hopefully, the stars will align again.
http://csgo.guru/match/2687!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6463!$VP!$Titan!$VP!$0.5!$0.62!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Much likely the best match-up we'll enjoy this evening. Virtus.Pro are moving here after a quite disappointing performance against Liquid, yes they won, but they managed to achieve it only during OT after suffering during the whole match, so stats-wise we are more prone in considering it just an "half-victory". We were expecting the Polish side to struggle a bit during their entry game, so we're not super-surprised, but we need to underline that they were really slow in their executions and also quite off in understanding the stuff that Liquid was setting up. So even if yesterday they managed to save themselves, today if they'll play in the same way, there are good chances to watch VP experiencing even more issues against Titan. On the other hand, the French/Belgian side thanks to an impressive show on Cobblestone (spiced up by the usual late-game choke) managed to roll over NiP, showing a quite strong determination and also a surprisingly good form. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of VP, and this is normal since they are the favored team to qualify, but honestly we don't feel fine in calling out Titan, in particular since there are good chances to watch de_cbble as map again, so we're prone in considering this game mostly as a pure 50/50 one, and our pick is a Low bet on Titan.
http://csgo.guru/match/2688!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6466!$Dignitas!$CLG!$CLG!$0.55!$0.52!$0.030000000000000027!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite interesting Tier2 match, CLG yesterday put up a decent show against NaVi, despite they weren't playing on their best map (the NA side never really focused too much on Cobblestone), while on the other hand Dignitas choked pretty hard against EnvyUs, for sure expected according to the current level of the Frenchmen, but to be honest we were expecting a slightly closer score. Talking about the current game, Dignitas are generally quite deadly against Tier2 teams, but we need to remember that they never really figured out how to mess with NA teams, and against Cloud9 during DH Stockholm they looked quite lost, however we're still prone in giving them a little edge since we believe that their teamplay is superior compared to CLG. Betting odds are still quite even, so our pick is a Low bet on Dignitas, with the hope to watch the Danes a bit more on-point than yesterday.
http://csgo.guru/match/2689!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6464!$EnVyUs!$Na'Vi!$EnVyUs!$0.55!$0.7!$-0.1499999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite great Tier1 game, but we don't believe we'll enjoy any relevant surprise. EnvyUs started with the pedal to the metal and rolled over Dignitas in relative ease, losing only 6 rounds in the process. On the other hand Natus Vincere had to sweat a bit more against CLG, despite the game was taking place on a map not really in favor of the North American side. At our end we doubt we'll watch Envy wasting their chance to hit Playoffs quickly, and according to what we watched in the past months so far, the French side looked way more in form compared to NaVi, additionally we believe that Envy shouldn't be affected too much by the veto outcome since they are generally quite on-point on the whole map-pool, and this is for sure a big plus. Betting odds are already pretty skewed in favor of the Frenchmen, and we agree on this trend, even if we need to note that these percentages are currently going a bit overboard. Our pick is a Low bet on EnvyUs, but we suggest to keep an eye on the values and eventually pick an ICB on NaVi if the odds will hit the 85/25 threshold.
http://csgo.guru/match/2690!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6474!$Cloud9!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.14!$0.26!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Group A decider, and the first Bo3 of DreamHack Cluj. For the first time in a pretty long while Fnatic are facing a potential early elimination in a Major. But honestly, when considering how badly they performed in the first two days, its no surprise they find themselves in this situation. Yet still quite unexpected, since to their detriment, both Vexed (JW and friends risked a lot against them) and Luminosity (here they lost 16-13) weren't really considered huge threats by the Swedes. However Fnatic still have arrows in their bow, and to their benefit, Cloud9 didn't impress in their two matches either, where they just didn't seem to be on-point. So Fnatic still has a solid chance to advance through and reach the playoffs. As just mentioned, C9 had quite a terrible first day, and they weren't able to impose their gameplay against Luminosity at all, despite de_dust2 being a map they always played extremely well. Anyways, in the following game they somehow managed to beat Vexed, even though they again didn't play exceptionally well. But it was enough to move to the decider. As for the match at hand, there are fairly high chances to watch this Bo3 require all 3 maps. Especially if we watch de_dust2, de_train and de_cbble as maps. If the veto goes so, C9 should have advantage on D2, while Train can easily go both ways and Fnatic will likely take Cobblestone. Betting odds are already extremely skewed, and barely profitable for a bet on Fnatic, so since real-world percentages are more around 60/40 we're more oriented in going for an ICB on Cloud9, even if (obviously) the likelihood of seeing it pay off aren't extremely high.
http://csgo.guru/match/2691!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6475!$mouz!$G2!$G2!$0.5!$0.3!$0.2!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Extremely interesting Tier2 match. The Group B decider doesn't feature any big names, but instead we'll enjoy an extremely balanced matchup between two teams that faced each other several times over the past few months. Mousesports are stepping into this game following quite a convincing victory over Flipsid3, but we need to note, that their entry game against G2 was quite shaky, and they didn't handle the veto well. As we mentioned in our Groupstage Preview too, in our opinion, Mouz are the most balanced team in this group (TSM excluded). They can sport some pretty high firepower coupled with some decent strats, so in a Bo3 environment, we expect them to demonstrate some stronger skill compared to the previously played Bo1s. On the other hand Gamers2 courtesy of a smart veto, managed to roll over Mouz in their entry game, but then they fell against TSM without offering much of a fight. With regards to the maps, we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train. Provided the veto goes this way, (even though they should), Mouz will not veto Inf, where G2 should be advantaged, while de_train is more of a random map and de_dust2 should go in favor of Mouz. Betting odds are currently in favor of G2, but honestly we believe that this is a pure 50/50 game. Mouz are generally a bit more reliable in matches featuring an extended map pool, so we're slightly more oriented in picking a Low bet on the German side since the odds are also quite nice for taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2692!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6478!$NiP!$Titan!$NiP!$0.5!$0.63!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Probably the best match-up we'll enjoy in this series of decider matches. Group C is referred as the "death group" because it's featuring some of the highest ranked teams, and we need to say that it hasn't failed to meet our expectations. Titan started DH Cluj pedal-to-the-metal, rolling through NiP in the entry game, but their run just as quickly ended the following day against the Polish wall. In a match where the French/Belgian mix made several big mistakes and suffered some huge tactical oversights. After a disastrous Day1, Nip on the other hand, managed to avoid the Liquid tricks in their second match and survivied through to the decider. But honestly they haven't been performing to their potential, and their execution has been looking a bit messy. Against Titan they have a little edge, but if they'll fail the veto (as happened frequently in the short-term) they'll be out without the need to even play the game. Regarding maps, theres high probability of seeing: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass. If it goes so, NiP should hold the advantage on both Cobblestone and Overpass, while Titan will very likely grab Dust2. Betting odds are again overly skewed in favor of NiP, while we're talking about mostly an even game. But in this case, due to the peculiar talents of these teams, we're a little more oriented in not playing them. To be more specific: Titan are extremely habitual in choking late game, while we're used to seeing NiP frequently achieve impressive comebacks. So in a pure 50/50 situation where overtime may enter the equation, we're inclined to picking the NiP horse rather than the Titan one. However we suggest keeping it a Low bet due to the crazy high risk.
http://csgo.guru/match/2693!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6483!$CLG!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.13!$0.32!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Last match of the day, and quite a peculiar Group D decider since we were expecting to see Dignitas, but instead CLG managed to bring their A game against the Danes, and most deservedly moved on to this last-chance match. Natus Vincere already rolled over the North American side in their entry game, but despite Guardian and friends managing to gain the upper hand, we have serious concerns about the risks they took in order to achieve it. And honestly, if they had performed in the first match as they did in the second, we instead might have easily seen the first finish in OT. But it didn't go down like that, and CLG had to defeat Dignitas (which was something rather remarkable based on how well Dig was performing over the past months) in order to seize their chance at redemption and the rematch with NaVi. As you may have assumed on your own, NaVi are obviously favored to move through, but in our eyes we're not convinced of this thesis yet. Particularly since its been quite a long time since NaVi has performed up to their talent level. As their game against Envy underlined, they have some serious issues, and even their communication (despite being on Lan) hasn't been as effective as it was mid-summer. If we watch de_cbble, de_overpass and de_mirage as maps, CLG should manage to grab Cobblestone laying the groundwork for watching this game end in a possible upset. More often than not, NaVi tend to give in as soon as something doesn't work as intended quickly giving way to defeat. So if CLG can manage to partially deviate NaVi's plan, they'll greatly improve their chances making room for us to enjoy a really close matchup. Betting odds are already quite bad, and the percentages continue to drop. NaVi are obviously advantaged, but their edge over CLG isn't as marginal as it may look. In the coming hours, we'll likely see the values approach the 85/15 threshold, (so even if we anticipate NaVi grabbing the ticket to the playoffs), we're a bit more oriented in yolo-ing an ICB on CLG, with the hope of sharing their victory and watching them living out their dream.

Conquest has been a storm blowing through the third tier for the past month, with most wins coming in convincing fashion. They've certainly showed they can play pretty strong, but more importantly on a consistent basis. So we always look forward to their matches, and their entertaining aggresive style. On the other side, the struggles plaguing Complexity unfortunately persist. And we dont expect their fortunes to improve much against a Conquest team playing as well as they are. However, this is a bo3, so they get more than one shot at them. According the veto pattern, we'll like see de_Dust2, de_Cbble, and de_Train. And quite honestly, Conquest is pretty well covered as far as the extended pool goes, when compared to coL's strengths. And however the veto goes, Conquest shouldnt have any real issue taking the win. With a little luck or so slow from Conquest, team Complexity might manage to grab 1 map, but we very much doubt Conquest will lose twice and expect to them meet LG in the finals. So we're comfortable with an Average bet on RUSH and friends.

We really suggest waking up early in order to avoid missing one of the most exciting matchups of the day. Fnatic are moving here after a rather dull GroupStage, where they hadn't shined since the very beginning. They opened with a loss against Luminosity on Thursday, which forced the Swedes to battle for survival in the decider match versus Cloud9. At our end, we were expecting a slightly closer game than what we saw, and actually the maps weren't even too bad for the NA side. But the North Americans are since removed from their grace period, and Fnatic managed to roll through them with relative ease. Not so promising since they're about to face EnvyUs, one of the teams who in the short-term have provided quite a series of amazing performances. The Frenchmen enjoyed a day off, because they managed to qualify as the 1st seed, and this is for sure to their benefit, lightening the pressure and provdiding time to plan their strats appropriately pending the following opponents. (The Bo1 hell is finished, so moving forward everything will be more methodical). About maps, we'll very likely watch de_inferno, de_train and de_cbble come out of the veto. If it goes as so, Envy should be a slightly advantaged on Cobblestone, while both Inferno and Train can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of EnvyUs, and honestly we're prone to agree with this vision. Without a doubt, they've displayed better things and have had way more consistently solid team-play compared to the not as convincing outings Fnatic has put forth thus far. However, we need to remember that we're still talking about a Major QF between two top-3 teams, so even if we're prone in picking a Low bet on Envy, the real-world odds are still around 55/45 and the game it self is incredibly risky, so avoid huge values and keep a low profile.
http://csgo.guru/match/2698!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6485!$G2!$VP!$G2!$0.4!$0.14!$0.26!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$This is actually an interesting matchup, since it'll be a great measuring stick for evaluating Gamers2 and provide us a clearer idea of their current level. But to be honest, we really don't anticipate any big surprises. Virtus.Pro, despite the typical shaky entry match, redeemed themselves with a brilliant performance against Titan, finishing their group in first place. This is quite a promising pattern for the Polish side, also advantaged in drawing a not-so-scary opponent in the Quarter Finals, (a big plus) now sets their sights on moving through to Semis. On the other hand, Gamers2 had to roll over Mouz twice before hitting the playoffs, and actually looked pretty tough doing it the second time through. Thanks to a bit of luck, and the Germans failure to manage the entire third map, G2 had finally grabbed a favorable result. This is after months of mixed performances. As for maps, in our opinion, we'll watch de_mirage, de_train and de_dust2. On paper, Virtus.Pro should have a clear edge on both Mirage and Train, while Dust2 will be the more balanced of the three. Betting odds are obviously super skewed in favor of the Polish side, and we too don't expect to see VP lose this game either, but we need to point out these percentages aren't too profitable, and they are still dropping. So even if our pick is Virtus.Pro, we highly suggest to consider a skip.

TSM are moving here after a couple of stunning victories we saw during the first days, but honestly they weren't in a super hard Group, and overall they faced less resistance compared to the rest of Tier1 teams. On the other hand, NiP had their hands full with a pretty hard fight, and the entry loss against Titan complicated things some. However, yesterday the Swedes clearly showed that it was just a minor hiccup in a bigger plan, and what they managed to achieve in the (decider) rematch against the French side was just mind blowing. We were speechless while watching NiP bash Titan 16-1 on de_dust2, evidently their best map. Something especially impressive to watch on Lan where score are more commonly way more tight. TSM are for sure stepping into this game as the favorite, coming with some strong momentum and they are well prepared for the whole extended map pool. But still we suggest not to underestimate NiP. They are still solidified amongst the Top-5, and with a smart veto and if their stars are in form, (which they appear to be) they are without a doubt a team fully capable of pulling an upset. Regarding the maps, we believe we'll watch de_dust, de_mirage and de_inferno. Should the veto go this way, both Dust2 and Mirage can go both ways, while TSM may have a little edge on Inferno. Betting odds are currently ridiculous, and with these percentages we've no doubts about going for an ICB/Low bet on NiP, since we strongly believe we'll watch a very even game.
http://csgo.guru/match/2700!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6492!$LG!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.39!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$And so we end today's Quarter-finals with what should be a pretty exciting matchup. The first seed coming out of Group A, Luminosity, took the hard road here. In the both of their first two matches, they had an uphill battle to climb as the underdog, but managed victorious over higher ranked opponenents in Cloud9 and Fnatic. LG began Cluj determined and prepared, having already moved to EU more than a week in advance in preparation for this DH lan event, and so far their commitment has paid dividends. So they're coming into this match rested after enjoy the winners' bye, but certainly brimming with confidence following the first two rounds. Natus Vincere on the other hand, didn't have the most difficult of a path to these qtr-finals, but did have to survive a decider match, to beat CLG for a 2nd time, after pushing past them the first time in their entry game. However, Navi was forced to the decider match after falling to EnVyUs in a humbling 16-9 loss on Day 2. Unfortunately, that loss exposed many weak points in Navi's game, so we're interested to see how intelligently LG manages that resource. But we need to note, Navi is undoubtedly the more experienced of the two, particluarly on lan. So the deeper this goes into the bo3, the more that may play in their favor. As for maps, we expect to we'll see de_Mirage, de_Cobble, and de_Dust2. If this is how it plays out, Navi should have a bit of an advantage on Mirage, while Dust2 and Cobblestone are mostly 50/50. So this for sure has all the ingredients for quite a potentially exciting finish to today's activity. Considering the impressive roll LG is on currently, on our end, we're oriented towards taking advantage of the percentages, so our pick is the slightly more rewarding Low bet on Luminosity.

On the Major's eve, nobody anticipated we would see Gamers2 go so far through the event. Especially since in the past months they never we able to show any level consistency like what they shown in these past several days. If there were ever a "Cindarella story", G2 has certainly taken on its meaning. and to be honest, we're quite pleased to see them finally competing at the highest level. Particularly after the past two quarters in Tier2 purgatory. A few hours ago, against VP, Maikelele and friends managed to put up what was essentially a perfect match. Beating the top-seated Polish side on de_cache, which happens to be one of their best maps. The task in itself is for sure something very impressive. But then to move on and beat them on de_train (another of the VP battle horses) was even more incredible, and clearly shows the devastating momentum coarsing through G2's veins right now. But then on the other hand, EnvyUs also controlled their match against Fnatic in convincing fashion as well. The Swedes came out swinging and took Mirage, yet the Frenchmen didn't lose focus and took home a clean victory, dominating both Cbble and Cache. As for the match on hand, we wouldn't be surprised to see a match closer than what these teams on paper would project. In particular since maps will liklely be de_dust2, de_train and de_mirage. And if the veto goes so, G2 could grab Mirage, while Dust2 should go to Envy, leaving the mostly 50/50 Train. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of the French side. Even if we have to agree in giving them an edge due to their wider experience, we do not agree with the current percentages edging the 80/20 threshold. So we are more oriented in playing the odds and attempting an ICB on Gamers2, in hopes of seeing them continuing to their unbelievable streak.

It's definitely quite weird watching Natus Vincere hitting the final stage of a Major when they spent the past couple of quarters struggling. And their management at some point even evaluated roster changes. For sure this is a great response, and to be honest I'm quite happy to see the NaVi tag back in the very high echelons of CS. However, nobody gifted this to them, NiP were for sure favored, but Guardian and friends played their veto cards smartly, and then they jumped in with a couple of jollies still to throw on the table. (After-all they didn't have to go through a super complex QF). Not much else to add, 16-3 and 16-6 are scores that speak for themselves, and clearly show the degree of NaVi's domination. On the other hand, EnvyUs had to sweat seven jerseys in order to take down Gamers2, and after a legendary two maps, the Frenchmen finally managed to put down G2 on de_cache. Overall EnvyUs are looking a bit shaky, for sure they are favored over NaVi but they seem beatable, and no longer invincible blue army they used to be in early autumn. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_train and de_mirage. If the veto will go so, we're talking about a set of maps really balanced. All of them can go both ways pretty easily, in particular since NaVi may benefit from the surprise fact that EnvyUs weren't expecting them to hit the Final. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of EnvyUs, but real-world ones are just 55/45, so we are oriented in suggesting just an ICB/Low bet on NaVi in order to take advantage of the percentages. Nothing else to add, grab some popcorn and enjoy the Grand Final of the most crazy Major so far!

In Cluj both Vexed and Mousesports (despite the promising performances) went home early. Vexed, as usual, looked quite fine against high-end teams and they managed to scare both Fnatic and Cloud9, but we should remember that online they rarely shined in T2-3 matches, and overall we find them still quite inconsistent in Bo3s. On the other hand, Mouz had a slightly better run in Cluj, they rolled over Fsid3 and edged the Playoffs qualification, but a superb G2 last map denied them the joy. We need to note that games taking place right after a Major are usually a bit more relaxed than usual, and scores are generally closer than expected, however since we're talking about a Bo3 game, we're a bit more oriented in giving an edge to the Germans, in particular since we believe we'll watch de_mirage, de_dust2 and de_train as maps. Betting odds are already pretty skewed and edging the ICB threshold, but due the format we're a bit more oriented in picking an Avg bet on Mouz.
http://csgo.guru/match/2707!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6514!$HR!$TSM!$TSM!$0.45!$0.2!$0.25!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$TSM performed way below expectations in Cluj, and NiP managed to roll over them in a quite easy fashion before crashing against the NaVi wall. However, we're a bit more prone in considering their QF elimination more as an episode rather than a trend, and we're pretty sure we'll watch the Danish side bouncing back really quickly. Today they'll face HellRaisers twice, and as usual they are using Schneider as 5th, but overall this shouldn't matter too much since they're basically playing as a mix since a while, and even if they managed to hit several upsets their current level is decreased compared to when they were fielding S1mple. On de_inferno the Danes should be widely advantaged, since HR never enjoyed too much playing on this map, and in the short term they used to veto it against most of the T1 teams. Betting odds are for sure overly skewed, and (again) edging the ICB threshold, but honestly we're feeling a bit safer in going Low+ on TSM rather than messing with the HR randomness.

We just want to note that the map now is de_cache, and here HellRaisers are generally quite good compared to Inferno, additionally this is a map quite forgiving teamplay-wise, so usually mixes and momentum-based teams always have their decent chances to hit an upset. On the other hand TSM always played Cache quite fine, so they are for sure still advantaged and the team to beat, but at least HR should have more chances compared to the previous game. Betting odds are a bit less skewed than before, and at our end we're oriented in risking a Low/ICB bet on HR.

The Danes had a quite rough run in Romania, they didn't manage to put up any decent fight against Envy, confirming that they still suffer a lot against T1 teams, but surprisingly they somehow lost versus CLG too, despite the map (de_cbble) was clearly in their favor. NiP didn't do bad at all, surely they missed their chance to hit the Grand Final in a pretty dumb way, since NaVi were for sure a manageable opponent, but overall we can say that they played way above the community expectations, showing a quite balanced teamplay and a pretty decent form. Dignitas never really played de_train too much, so we don't think they'll manage to take down the Swedes, however post-Major games are always a bit tricky, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch scores closer than expected. Betting odds are still quite fine for going Average on NiP, so this is our pick too.
http://csgo.guru/match/2710!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6517!$SK!$TSM!$TSM!$0.3!$0.16!$0.13999999999999999!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say, TSM shouldn't face any real issue in rolling over SK on de_overpass since they always provided quite on-point performances on this map. While on the other hand SK are in a slump since a while, constantly under lineup issues (today they'll play with MODDII as 5th). Additionally we need to note that they very rarely managed to put up AAA shows against T1-2 teams on this maps. Betting odds are already quite off an not really rewarding so you can either skip or go Average on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/2711!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6518!$NiP!$EnVyUs!$NiP!$0.5!$0.32!$0.18!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$For sure the most interesting match of the day, and for many the Cluj Grand Final we should have watched. However, this is a Bo1 on de_cbble and we highly doubt we'll watch NiP setting up a way better show than the NaVi one, since this is one of the EnvyUs best maps. According to the performance that the Frenchmen delivered on Sunday, we believe that just TSM and Fnatic can provide them a real challenge on Cobblestone. Anyway, as we already wrote several times today, things are a bit more relaxed right after a Major, in particular for the team that took the trophy, so you shouldn't be surprised to watch Envy struggling a bit and/or providing a battle way below the expectations. Betting odds are currently obviously skewed in favor of the French side, and this is correct, however since we're talking about a match involving the Cluj winners, and a team that much likely spent the past couple of days celebrating the victory, we're a bit more oriented in setting the real-world odds a little bit more in the middle. Our pick is a Low bet on NiP in order to take advantage of the percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2712!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6521!$Penta!$mouz!$mouz!$0.4!$0.4!$0.0!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$German derby and always a quite interesting match to watch. Penta still have a pretty long path ahead, and even if in the short-term they improved a bit they are still on a quite bumpy road, however de_dust2 is a map always prone to upsets and it doesn't really require top-notch planning. So we're talking about one of the few maps where Penta have a real chance to setup a decent fight. On the other hand, Mousesports are just back from Cluj, where they edged playoff qualification (G2 denied them the joy with a 2-1 victory), generally they always managed to read Penta's strats pretty well, and overall Nex and friends are surely a step ahead Penta. Betting odds are still quite balanced and pretty fine for a Low bet on Mouz, so we're oriented in taking this way since we find them a bit more complete than Penta. Anyway we wouldn't be surprised to watch a close game, so avoid huge values.
http://csgo.guru/match/2713!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6533!$Cloud9!$coL!$coL!$0.6!$0.71!$-0.10999999999999999!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$We kick off the NA schedule with a couple of ESL matches. This one is actually a fairly interesting matchup to get them going. Over the past week we saw Cloud9 abruptly hit a wall, and basically lost all their momentum. They went into DH CLuj ambitious to turn things around, but ultimately the whole event was a bust for them. They edged a single win vs Vexed to avoid elimination, but they merely delayed the ineitable, as they were next dominated by Fnatic (who werent even near their best either). So now they have to shake it off and try to regain their composure. So we're curious see how they respond. Meanwhile, Complexity is also seeking out some consistency, but in the short term their performances have been anything but consistent. Its been awhile now since coL has shown much promise, but they still randomly have glimmers. The fact that both these teams are struggling, which might result in a more of a pug-like contest, and may be fun to watch. The bo1 will be on de_Inferno, which coL hasnt played too frequently, but although C9 has more experience on it, they've had mixed results. So C9 has a lil bit on an additional edge due as far as the map goes. This is reflected in the Betting Odds trending in favor of Cloud9. Although C9 hasn't been impressive lately, by neither has coL, so while percentages are still rewarding our pick is an Average bet on Cloud9.
http://csgo.guru/match/2716!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6523!$WinterFox!$coL!$coL!$0.45!$0.43!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the first of two matches between these teams scheduled today. This will like be more of a warmup much, since they'll proceed to a Bo3 in their following game. We already covered the fact Winterfox is no longer split between NA/EU, so thats for sure a change for the better, but now the lineup has to develope their team chemistry. Complexity continues in their inconsistent ways, but they have shown some positives things in the few performances on de_mirage. Overall these teams are mostly on par with each other, but the recent changes in Wfx is keeping percntages and odds ever so slightly in coL's favor. Until we see more of Wfx in their current form and until they gets some practice together, we're not expecting to see anything too impressive from them. Considering the randomness this matchup, and with percentages not being too rewarding either way, we definitley suggest considering a skip on this one. But if you need to pick a side, we'd go Low on coL since they generally played well on Mirage.
http://csgo.guru/match/2717!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6532!$coL!$WinterFox!$coL!$0.55!$0.65!$-0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Another Low tier NA matchup, but kind of a random one at that. As we mentioned in their first match, Winterfox is finally no longer hindered by EU line issues, but the lineup changes havent stabilized the team much more beyond that, so they still remain at somewhat of a disadvantage. Furthermore, this is a StarSeries Bo3, so the extended maps puts more focus on teamplay than a one and done Bo1. Again we've already stated Complexity has been very inconsistent for a while now, and surely need take an edge whenever they can find one. As we just mentioned in their opening contest, the two teams are about equal in talent and firepower, but Wfx gives up some advantage while getting roster experience. But honestly, we feel the extra maps furthers coL's advantage, and they'll very unlikely lose two of the maps. As for the maps, guessing the veto with respect to Wfx's roster changes mostly unpredictable. So theres not much say on that. This isn't a very appealing match bet-wise, our real-world odds are in slightly favor of coL, and particularly due to the extended map pool, so our pick is Low bet on coL too, even if the percentages aren't really great.
http://csgo.guru/match/2718!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6534!$CLG!$Liquid!$CLG!$0.45!$0.36!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$NA match of the day, and for sure a quite interesting post-Cluj match-up. Both CLG and Liquid are just back from the latest Major, where they failed to hit playoffs and stopped their run during the Groupstage. CLG overall have been a bit more lucky, thanks to a shaky performance from Dignitas, they managed to roll over the Danes and hit the decider match against NaVi, where unfortunately they had to pack their bags despite a quite promising start. On the other hand Liquid had to face more issues since they were located in the infamous Group of Death, without doubts they resembled a bit a sacrificial prey in a pool full of sharks. However, they managed to put up a great match against VP, and the Polish side managed to take the upper hand only during OT. In the following game, NiP managed to win mostly due their superior experience, and then Liquid had to go home with just 2 defeats in the bag. However, here we're talking about a NA derby taking place on de_inferno, a map where generally Liquid always showed quite good things, and on the North American soil we believe that Liquid have all the right cards to deal with CLG, even if Tarik and co. went slightly forward in Cluj. Betting odds are still quite decent for a Low+ bet on Liquid, so we're oriented in taking this path since we believe they have a slightly edge on Inferno.

Anyway, we've to note that HellRaisers in their current iteration (with Schneider) are looking quite inconsistent, and despite they frequently start well pushing the pedal to the metal, they aren't really capable to manage the mid-late game properly yet. Additionally on de_inferno HR rarely managed to provide top-notch results, while on the other hand Envy are generally quite decent. Betting odds are obviously skewed in favor of the Frenchmen, and we kinda agree on this trend, however we need to note that the current percentages are already pretty off and not really profitable, so our pick is Envy but you should evaluate a plain skip too.
http://csgo.guru/match/2723!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6554!$NiP!$HR!$HR!$0.55!$0.68!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for HellRaisers, this time against NiP. Yesterday the Swedes surprisingly managed to take the upper hand over EnvyUs, and their momentum seems quite strong, however de_overpass is surely a quite tricky map, during the past quarter they used to veto it on a pretty frequent basis, and overall they never shined too much on it. On the other hand HR, always messed with it more regularly, and as general rule they are usually quite ok on the 'new' maps, despite currently they are still running with Schneider as stand-in. Betting odds are overly skewed in favor of NiP, and they are for sure slightly advantaged, but honestly real-world percentages are more around 60/40, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch HR setting up a way better game compared to the first one. Our pick is a Low/ICB bet on HR, mostly in order to take advantage of the more rewarding values.

Penta are for sure cruising in troubled waters, but on de_cache they always managed to setup amazing fights, and in the short-term on this map they already managed to beat both VP and NaVi. However, we need to note that these results are for sure relevant from a side, but on the other happened when the German team was experiencing a slightly more consistent moment. On the other hand, NiP are not joining this game unprepared since lately they focused a lot on this map, and also achieved several really promising victories, so despite Penta may put up something quite enjoyable we doubt we'll watch the Swedish side falling against them. Betting odds are still quite decent for going with a Low+/Avg- on NiP, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2730!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6571!$Cloud9!$WinterFox!$Cloud9!$0.55!$0.76!$-0.20999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$A pretty random matchup here. Cloud9, arguably the best team out of NA, has fallen on some hard times lately. Yesterday we expected a bit of a bounce back after a disappointing Cluj appearance, but even Complexity and 3sUP were too much for them as their struggles continued. Considering the amount of firepower on C9, it's hard not to expect them to turn it around at any point. Meanwhile, Winterfox is still in their infancy stage for their new lineup. So we're not putting too much stock in their losses yesterday, which despite the end result, still mostly offered a decent show as a roster with limited experience. So we expect see their confidence grow with each match, and look foward to seeing how they progess. Normally, we'd expect C9 to be a good measuring stick match for Wfx, but as just stated C9 is not currently playing anywhere near the level we're used to seeing from them. Furthermore, this Faceit Bo1 will be hosted at de_overpass, where statistically Wfx should have an advantage especially since they defeated C9 here before Cluj by a shocking 16-3 two weeks back. But again, that wasn't the same Wfx team and C9 was playing with a standin. Overall, on paper, this match should be easy pick on Skadoodle and friends, but there recent struggles are edging towards the point of concern, so we're really unsure which C9 will show up tonight. Between that and the new Wfx, this may be a match to skip. But if a pick is a must, we're honestly slightly more oriented in chasing the bigger rewards (on the chance C9 is still playing with their heads in the clouds - excuse the pun) and placing a ICB bet on Winterfox. At least until C9 shows something encouraging.

Yesterday Liquid didn't enjoy too much their first match-day after Cluj, and the whole evening didn't go as expected for Hiko and friends. Early the lost (in a quite dumb way) against FE, and then they failed to put up any solid fight versus CLG, despite Inferno wasn't a bad map pick. However, now we're talking about a match taking place on de_cbble, here Liquid always delivered really on-point performances, and they are arguably one of the NA teams that focused more on it. Worth noting that in Cluj, on this map, they managed to force VP into Overtime, so we're not joking when we say that they are usually quite good at it. On the other hand, this is the first game after the Major for Luminosity, so we don't expect a super performance from the Brazilian side, and as usual the first days after an huge offline event are always a bit shaky. Additionally in the short-term they didn't play too much on Cobblestone, and in comparison they favored a bit more Overpass. Anyway, we're still talking about a team that put up really good things in Cluj, so real-world odds are quite balanced and we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game. Betting odds are slightly in favor of the North American side, and we kinda agree on this trend, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on Liquid, but we suggest to avoid huge values due the pretty high risk.
http://csgo.guru/match/2732!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6573!$LG!$CLG!$LG!$0.5!$0.48!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Here we have probably the best match on the NA schedule tonight, mainly due to the quite impressive outing we saw from Luminosity at DH Cluj. LG had stunned many by taking the 1st seed out of Group A following consecutive victories over CLoud9 and Fnatic. Unfortunately they ran into a hotter NaVi who eliminated LG on their way to the Finals. But we need to point out, although NaVi swept the bo3 in 2 games, LG absolutely gave them a run for their money, and only a few rounds seperated LG from progressing. Nevertheless, LG has generally been playing the best they've played in a long time and seem to have a renewed sense of confidence. On the other hand, CLG had a less encouraging Cluj performance, where they were also eliminated by NaVi, however that was in the Group D decider match to determine the final playoff spot. Prior to that, CLG had been a little shaky and had been performing with some inconsistency. In particular, they've had mixed results in the lower tiered contests. However, they've taken a step in the right direction as they defeated Liquid yesterday. So this match is should make for a great test for CLG. Betting odds started out well in favor of CLG, but have since evened up some, now only slightly favoring CLG. But we have real-world odds at 50/50, and anticipate a good show. And with this ESL match being played on de_cache, a slightly stronger map for LG, we're going with a Low bet on Luminosity for our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/2734!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6572!$WinterFox!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.3!$0.15!$0.15!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Lately Liquid have managed to setup quite an impressive series of performances on de_overpass. Even though we're talking about a map thats kinda always tricky in the North American scene, we are still optimistic towards Hiko and the gang. On the other hand, WinterFox never really focused on this map. Even moreso now with the updated lineup we don't believe we'll see them set up anything too complex or suitable for a very strats-intensive map such as Overpass. Betting odds are already widely skewed in favor of Liquid, and even if real-world odds are a bit less extreme we don't think that the upset chances are incredibly high, so our pick is an Average bet on Liquid.

This is a Bo2, and honestly according with the kinda shaky performances that both teams managed to setup in the short-term we wouldn't be surprised to watch just a Tie. Vexed are just back from DH Cluj, where they didn't do too bad and they managed to scare both Cloud9 and Fnatic, however we need to remember that their Online performances aren't really on par with their Lan ones, and they frequently lacked of the consistence required in order to take the upper hand in matches featuring an extended map-pool. On the other hand, CSGL are in a slump since a quite long while, in the past weeks they managed to hit a streak of ties but overall we're talking about a team that always practiced a quite limited amount of maps, and in most of the cases a smart veto is enough to condemn them to a tie/loss. For some reason betting odds are currently quite skewed in favor of CSGL, while we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 match, so we have no doubts in picking a Low bet on Vexed in order to take advantage of the skewed percentages.

On the other hand E-Frag aren't doing too bad, and they are always a quite tricky opponent to face since they frequently step-up against top-tier opponents, however we need to note that in the short term they mostly faced low-tier contenders, so even if they could be capable to force G2 into a third map we don't believe we'll watch the Bulgarian side hitting an upset on a game featuring a Bo3 format. Betting odds are trending in favor of Maikelele and friends, and this is quite obvious due their recent performances, overall percentages are still decent for an Average bet on G2, so we're oriented in taking this path.

However, despite EnvyUs aren't always perfect on de_mirage, we highly doubt we'll watch the Frenchmen failing against Penta, since the Germans lately are experiencing quite critical issues and overall they looked pretty out of form during most of the games the played in the past 2 weeks. As mentioned above, betting odds are pretty off and not really rewarding, so as usual when we talk about games involving percentages around 90/10 we highly suggest to evaluate a skip and move forward. However, if you really need that Bizons &amp; cents, our pick is EnvyUs.

On the other hand, SK despite the slump lasting since months, and all the roster related issues, finally saw some light and in the past few matches they displayed encouraging performance. Obviously they are still an extremely unreliable team and mostly a mix, but at least they should be able to grab a map and Tie the game. Betting odds are still floating a lot, but honestly we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game, so we're a bit more oriented in gambling with the percentages instead of picking a side for on-paper performances. So our pick is a Low bet on CSGL.

CLG are on kind of rampage since moving back to home soil, but their good streak ended yesterday evening with a surprisingly marginal loss against Luminosity. Something we shouldn't have expected since Tarik and friends used to be quite decent on de_cache, which is also the map they'll play in this game against C9. Cloud9 are moving here directly following their entry game against Enemy, which will take place on the same map as well, so they should be well warmed up and already decently focused. But as mentioned above, they currently aren't experiencing their brightest of moments, and the whole team is quite out of sync. Betting odds are quite mixed, and they're still moving quite a bit. At our end, we're prone to considering this game as a pure 50/50 one, even if C9 used to show slightly better things on this map. (But as we learned yesterday in LG-CLG, things within the NA scene are currently quite messy, and don't follow any real pattern). So our pick is a Low bet on CLG, with the hope to watch them a bit more on-point than yesterday against the Brazilians.

In the short-term they mostly faced not the most challenging ofteams. But by beating Cloud9 on de_inferno, they clearly showed that they aren't a fluke and that together as a team they've improved marginally and with good form. On the other hand, CLG are moving here after a couple of not so easy games, but honestly they have always provided rather consistent results on de_train, and within the North American scene they have always been one of the few teams that played this map on a regular basis and with pretty solid results over time. (They had slightly more issues against EU teams, but thats a different story). Betting odds are quite skewed in favor of Tarik and friends, and we agree on this trend. Current percentages are still pretty decent for going with a Low+ bet on CLG, so we're oriented in taking this path. However coL are actually looking pretty fine too as of late, and wouldn't be surprised to watch them start the game pedal to the metal, so we don't suggest to risk values above Low.

Titan are moving here after a quite disappointing run @ DH Cluj, where despite the start with the pedal to the metal failed to qualify for playoffs and had to pack their bags early. However, worth mentioning that they were placed within the infamous 'Group of Death', so the chances for the French/Belgian side to move ahead were quite low since the very beginning. Actually Titan are also one of the very few teams that didn't play any match right after Cluj, and instead they took a week off, so guessing what they are going to put up in this game isn't easy at all. On the other hand Luminosity had slightly more luck in Romania, and they surprisingly managed to move to playoffs as first seed after a couple of really beautiful victories, unfortunately for them they didn't manage to keep their streak in the following Bo3 versus NaVi, and they had to drop the ball. Anyway, without any doubt the Brazilians are on a quite great form, and they showed really good things online as well. Betting odds for this game are still extremely even, and we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 match-up, in particular since we'll probably watch de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass, a set of maps where both teams always showed consistent performance. At our end we're a bit more prone in picking a Low bet on LG, mostly because in our opinion their momentum is stronger, but we don't suggest to go for high values due the extremely high risk.

Regardless, this is for sure a slightly less thrilling match-up compared to the first, and based on what Natus Vincere displayed in Cluj, we've no doubts in calling them favored. Overall the Bo3 format should provide some stability in the T1 VS T2 kind of matches, and even if Mousesports are usually quite deadly on several maps, their threat should be mitigated by the extended map-pool. So even if the Germans should be able to grab a map, we highly doubt we'll watch Guardian and friends lose two of the three maps. With regards to those maps, good chances to seeing de_dust2, de_cbble and de_train. If the veto goes this way, NaVi should be slightly advantaged on Cobblestone and Train, while Dust2 is mostly a pure 50/50 one. Betting odds are trending in favor of NaVi, but remain quite acceptable for a Low+ bet, so we're oriented in taking this path.

In Cluj Liquid failed to provide performances in line with the expectations, (but their show on Cobblestone vs VP was surely remarkable) and shortly after they also experienced plenty of issues in the following online matches. They struggled quite a bit trying to re-gain their form. However, historically they have been a bit more reliable on Lan games. So we've high hopes for them and believe that there are good chances to watch them bounce back. On the other hand Dignitas have faced plenty of issues lately. In Cluj they offered an invisible performance, and in the following online match against NiP, they proved once more that they are still quite aways from Tier1 contention, despite some of better results achieved in the middle one. As for maps, in our opinion we'll watch : de_cache, de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto follows as so, Dignitas should be slightly advantaged on Mirage, while Cache favors Liquid, and Overpass is the random map of the group. Betting odds are mostly in favor of Liquid, and we have to agree with this trend since they've looked way more consistent than the Danes, so we're prone to going with a Low bet on Hiko and the gang.

Conquest certainly lack the LAN experience and everything by comparison, but they not a team to look past. They already proved in multiple matches, that they are one of the most promising NA teams of this season. Naturally Virtus.Pro are favored, and the Bo3 format is going to help them a lot, since it will very likely avoid their usual 'entry game fail'. Which should allow the Poles to grab the match even while overlooking a map in the process. At our end, we are really looking forward to this game, since we've always been really fascinated by the style Conquest plays. Plus there are good chances to watch a game slightly closer than expected since VP are stepping into this match without solid 'references' about the Canadian side. And they may need a while in order to figure out how to properly counter them. About maps, with some luck, Conquest could be able to force VP to de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass. If it goes so, both Cobblestone and Overpass will be pretty tight, while Dust2 should end in favor of VP. Betting odds are widely skewed in favor of VP, mainly due to their superior experience, but from our end we veiw this game as a tricky one. And we're slightly more prone to gambling with the percentages by going for an ICB on Conquest. With the hope to watch the NA side setting up the same beautifully impressive things, as they've demonstarted in some of their online games.
http://csgo.guru/match/2750!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6618!$LG!$mouz!$mouz!$0.55!$0.55!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Super interesting game since yesterday both teams managed to hit a couple of crazy upsets, and they surprisingly managed to achieve them with fair and square 2-0 scores, something surely promising and not really easy to do when we talk about Bo3 Lan matches. Luminosity basically destroyed Titan, and the French/Belgian side failed to put up any relevant fight despite the maps (Cache/Cbble) weren't too bad, and on paper quite manageable. On the other hand Mousesports pulled an half-miracle out of the hat, and this is for sure even more impressive than the LG-Titan game, since NaVi hit a 2nd place in Cluj just a week ago, and in this game they were considered as the clear favorite. However, we truly believe that when they are focused, the Germans can actually deliver quite good shows, and probably in Cluj they didn't manage to perform properly mostly due the really high pressure. Betting odds are currently slightly skewed in favor of LG, and this is correct since the Brazilians are slightly more consistent than Mouz, but honestly this is going to be a pretty even game, since both teams have a really similar veto-pattern (we'll likely watch: de_cache, de_overpass &amp; de_cbble), so we're a bit more prone in playing the odds and picking a Low bet on Mouz.

Natus Vincere in particular played in a pretty invisible way, featuring totally out-of-sync executions and a plain wrong match management. They basically fell for every Mouz bait, without even understanding that the Germans were mostly taking advantage of their usual kinda passive playstyle. Titan didn't manage to achieve anything better, but at least we've to say that LG are always a tricky opponent to face, and the match it self on paper was way more balanced than NaVi - Mouz. Anyway, this doesn't justify at all the extremely (and unusual) slow start they had, while the late-game finished with the French/Belgian side tilting as usual (but without their usual start with the pedal to the metal, the finals scores were quite low). Talking about the current match, there are good chances to watch de_overpass, de_cbble and de_train as maps. If the veto goes so, both Overpass and Cobblestone can easily go both ways, while Train should be in favor of NaVi. Betting odds are currently widely skewed in favor of Guardian and friends, but since both teams played pretty poorly we're more oriented in going ICB/Low on Titan, rather than risking an Avg bet on NaVi.
http://csgo.guru/match/2752!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6623!$VP!$Dignitas!$VP!$0.58!$0.71!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Yesterday Dignitas managed to hit one of the many upsets we enjoyed during the first CEVO Finals day, and surely quite a good way to bounce back after a pretty disappointing DH Cluj, where the Danes had to pack their bags after just a couple of games. On paper Liquid were for sure favored, since they are considered by many as the most solid NA team of the past quarter, but this didn't prevent them from biting the dust quite quickly after a pretty questionable veto. On the other hand, Virtus.Pro had to deal with Conquest, the tricky Canadian youngsters managed to deliver a really amazing show and even if the Poles closed the game with a 2-0 score, this was the tightest contest we experienced yesterday. Overall Shahzam and the gang provided a really enjoyable show (and a nice OT as well!). About maps, we'll very likely watch de_overpass, de_train and de_mirage. If the veto will go so VP should be advantaged on all of them, additionally worth noting that Dignitas are usually kinda off when they have to face T1 EU teams, and they never managed to figure out how to handle this kind of games properly. Betting odds are rolling in favor of VP, and the current percentages are still fine for going for a Low+/Avg- bet on VirtusPro, so this is our pick as well.

Liquid are stepping into this game as favorite (even if they dropped the ball against Dig yesterday) due to their wider Lan experience and the more consistent Bo3 performances. However we need to say that Conquest are looking quite pumped-up, and their brilliant game against VP should have provided them some extra confidence. So they are stepping into this match as a serious contender, with quite even chances to grab a victory. About maps, both teams are featuring a quite different veto-pattern, additionally the veto within the NA scene (usually) follows a different logic where most of the teams are generally more focused in vetoing the opponent's best maps rather than working in order to play on they favored ones. This frequently causes pretty weird picks and matches to be way more balanced than expected. In our opinion we'll watch : de_inferno, de_mirage and de_train. If it'll go so, Liquid should have an edge on Mirage, while both Inferno and Train will be 50/50. Betting odds are still moving a bit, but overall they'll very likely keep floating around the middle, so at our end we're a bit more prone in going Low on Liquid due their higher experience.

Luminosity early today surprisingly lost with a plain 2-0 versus Mouz, despite we were expecting a way closer game. On the other hand Titan managed to setup a quite great fight against NaVi and grabbed the ticket for continuing their run. LG already managed to beat Titan yesterday, and in that case the French/Belgian side didn't offer any serious fight and they played in a kinda disappointing way, however we need to say that today they looked a bit revitalized, and there are good chances to watch them bouncing back. Betting odds are still pretty even, and overall this is a pure 50/50 game with good chances to watch de_dust2, de_cbble and de_overpass as maps. At our end we're a bit more oriented in picking a Low bet on Titan, since this evening they looked a bit more in form compared to LG, but we don't suggest to go for values above Low since we're talking about an extremely risky game that can easily go both ways.
http://csgo.guru/match/2755!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6630!$Dignitas!$Conquest!$Conquest!$0.5!$0.63!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Must-watch game between two teams who are definitely on-fire today, and have both provided some pretty impressive shows so far. Conquest as we previewed yesterday, are no easy opponent to face, nor are they just an 'avg NA Tier2' team. We are talking about a well-rounded squad featuring quite a unique playstyle that works extremely fine in both local NA games, as well as International. Honestly, some really promising &amp; cool stuff. On the other hand Dignitas missed their chance to beat VP, and it's a pity since with a little more effort they could have won de_inferno, which after-all is quite a manageable map against the Poles. Anyways, we've to say that overall the Danish side looked quite on point, and they seem to be bouncing back pretty well after a somewhat disappointing performance @ Cluj. Talking about the current game, betting odds are extremely skewed in favor of Dignitas, mostly because most of the people aren't taking Conquest seriously. Which is quite big mistake. This is nothing short of a pure 50/50 match, and Dignitas are stepping into this match without any point of reference of their opposition, and they have proved plenty of times that they have serious issues in facing teams they don't fight on a regular basis. Additionally the veto-pattern is quite balanced and there are extremely high chances to watch: de_cbble, de_inferno and de_train. A trio of maps that can easily go both ways. As we mentioned above, betting odds are too skewed, so we've no doubts in taking advantage of them by going Low on Conquest.

Virtus.Pro didn't really impress in the past few days, they surely managed to hit the Semis but overall they're not playing amazingly and they risked a lot in the process, even against not really top-tier opponents or versus teams that they are used to beat way more easily. Titan are for sure a quite unpredictable opponent to face, and predicting their performances is always a bit like flipping a coin since as team they don't really have any middle ground, and they can either play really well or fail terribly. We already experienced these two faces early in the Finals, when they lost by measure in their entry game against LG and then managed to beat team convincingly just a day later. Talking about the current game, there are good chances to watch de_overpass, de_train and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, Titan should be advantaged on Inferno, while Overpass is kinda 50/50 and Train in slightly favor of VP. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Polish side, but honestly we're talking about a pretty balanced game and overall VP are looking a bit below their usual average, so at our end we're a bit more prone in playing with the percentages by picking a Low bet on Titan.
http://csgo.guru/match/2757!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6647!$mouz!$Conquest!$mouz!$0.55!$0.69!$-0.1399999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Extremely interesting game. Conquest are currently on an incredible run, and we hope you followed our previous suggestions about them. Overall the Canadian side is looking extremely consistent and (as we stated several times already) they are surely the NA team that managed to bring to the table the most convincing strats of the past quarter. This is a plain fact, and we suggest the several analysts that don't agree (internally we're pretty sure that they don't even watch NA CS) should put on a good pair of glasses (or at least check the data before talking). However, Mousesports did great as well, and they've proved one more time that in a 'low-pressure' environment they can perform way better than usual. Honestly we see more 'long-term' potential in them than in Dignitas (the Danes have serious issues vs T1 teams, while Mouz are more balanced). Overall this is not an easy game to predict, Mouz are generally more used in focusing on defensive strats, while Conquest are fast paced and more 'bait-oriented', so we're talking about two totally different playstyles. Anyways, we're prone to giving a little edge to the Germans, since usually playing defensive against a team that doesn't have any reference about you is a bit easier. Regardless, we're not talking about super relevant numbers, and a 5% edge is basically nothing. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_train, de_cbble and de_inferno. If the veto goes so Conquest should be able to grab Inferno, while Mouz is advantaged on Cobblestone, and Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of Mouz, so we're oriented in taking advantage of this by going Low on Conquest, with the hope to watch them continuing their great run.

Overall Mouz looked solid and well-rounded, even if they risked a bit against Conquest they still managed to take advantage of their superior experience. Despite the last map not really being in their favor, and certainly a bit tricky. On the other hand VP took advantage of a not-so-great day for Titan, and as we explained in the previous game the Frenchmen are one of the most inconsistent T1 teams, so we weren't too surprised by the 2-0 score. However, talking about the current match, VP are obviously advantaged due the wider experience on the extended map-pool, but we wouldn't be surprised to see the Germans take a map or two and set up a decent fight. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on PashaBiceps and friends, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2761!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6654!$CLG!$NME!$CLG!$0.55!$0.82!$-0.2699999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$The only other match of the weekend following the conclusion of CEVO S8 Finals, another RGN game featuring a pair of fairly acquainted NA teams. Since DH Cluj, CLG has had a pretty busy schedule, but their results have been inconsistent with performances even more shaky. In their last game we saw them get dominated by CompLexity in match they only managed to win 3 rounds, which is quite out of character for them. Overall, they currently seem to be on a bit of decline. But their last decent outing was against today's opponent. Enemy on the other hand has also been challeneged with issues of consistency as well. However, in the past few weeks, we've seen a gradual improvement in their teamplay skills and noted they're starting to put together some stronger perfomances and appear to be on an upswing. So this match against a T2 CLG might be arriving at good time for NME take advantage. For the maps in this best-of-3, we should see de_cache, de_overpass, and de_train. Both teams are quite familiar on these maps, but statistically CLG should have the advantage provided they play to form. Betting odds are currently skewed well in favor of CLG, but on our end, we feel real world odds are much more balanced. Granted, on paper, this should be an easy match for Tarik and friends since we're talking about a game taking place on the extended map-pool, but if they don't take NME seriously today it could be to their detriment. So with percentages being so skewed, we're oriented by a yolo mentality and inclined to go for the ICB on NME.
http://csgo.guru/match/2762!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6659!$EnVyUs!$CSGL!$EnVyUs!$0.65!$0.9!$-0.25!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say since we're talking about a Bo3 and EnvyUs are obviously favored. Honestly the chances to watch the Frenchmen failing a game taking place on the extended map-pool (against a so-so opponent) are pretty low. After-all, we are talking about one of the most well-rounded teams out there. On the other hand, CSGL are one of the most inconsistent T3 lineups. They have an extremely limited bunch of 'favorite maps' and they've rarely managed to shine outside the Bo1 format. Betting odds are extremely skewed and not really profitable, so as usual when we talk about games involving 90/10 percentages we highly suggest to evaluate a skip, but if you want to bet anyway our pick is EnvyUs.

E-Frag are finally back on the right path and they're currently sitting on quite a nice winning streak, however we need to note that they mostly faced low-end opponents, and this surely aided some in masking their limits. (G2 excluded, but in that game Gamers2 basically played in 4 due Maikelele messing with the exgf-gate) On the other hand, HellRaisers are still playing with Schneider as stand-in, and overall the whole team doesn't have a real identity but they have a kinda pug-like approach. Even though we need to say that it's not working too bad, the results they managed to achieve are surely acceptable (but stuff was obviously more balanced with S1mple, sadly the trade didn't end well). About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_inferno. If the veto goes so, HR should be advantaged on Overpass, Efrag will likely take Inferno, while Dust2 is basically 50/50. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Efrag, mostly because their streak and their latest success over G2, but in reality this is a quite balanced game and Kucher and friends should have a slight edge due to their slightly superior experience. So at our end we're oriented in picking a Low bet on HR.

Overall the Frenchmen are surely in a grace moment, they won @ Cluj and they are currently sitting on a pretty convincingly streak, additionally they're are leading our World Ranking as well. Currently Betting odds aren't really exceptional, and the percentages are barely profitable (they're still dropping), so even if EnvyUs are clearly advantaged we're a bit more oriented in attempting an ICB on HR, but honestly the upset chances aren't really crazy high so just go for few cents.

In the short-term NiP started vetoing again de_mirage, and basically since Natu left they stopped playing it on a daily basis, anyway they should be quite decent, and even in we wouldn't be surprised to watch SK providing a decent fight in their CT side the Swedes should be able to take home at least a 16-12 victory. Betting odds are widely skewed in favor of F0rest and friends, but still decent for a Low+/Avg-- bet on NiP, so this is our pick.

Betting odds here are extremely skewed and barely profitable, as usual we cannot really advice to waste time on games featuring 90/10 percentages, so you should really consider a plain skip. However, if you want to go with a side anyway our pick is EnvyUs.

However, de_cache should be an appropriate map for the to bounce back. and CompLexity (despite having started playing some decent CS lately), never really impressed on this map, nor are they used to playing it on a regular basis. As already mentioned, C9 are a bit like roulette right now, and stuff for them hasn't been going too well for quite a while. So even if they manage to grab this game they still have a lot of work in order to regain what they lost, in comparison to CLG/Liquid/Conquest. Betting odds are currently pretty balanced, so at our end we're oriented in going Low on C9, with the hope of not watching them tilt after 10 rounds (as they did in the past few matches).

Both teams had some stutters over the past weeks, but we need to say that CLG are back in business since slightly longer (they didn't attend CEVO) so they might be a bit more focused and in form compared to Luminosity, who are playing today their first online game after CEVO Finals. Generally, we have to note that LG are usually a bit better in reading CLG than the opposite. They frequently managed to outplay them and they are pretty fine in countering the -sometimes messy strats provided by Tarik and the gang. On the other hand de_cbble is surely a map trending a bit in favor of CLG, since they used to play it on a regular basis. While the Brazilian side rarely relied on it, even if honestly most of the time, they provided decent shows and nothing really below their average. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Luminosity, mostly because the H2H scores are trending in their favor, but honestly we're talking about a very balanced game, so at our end we're prone in attempting a Low bet on CLG, in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages.

On the other hand, Gamers2 didn't play too much during the past week and the only couple of games they played (right after their brilliant show @ Cluj) went in a kinda disappointing way, however as we stated a couple of times already, we need to remember that Maikelele had to deal with several personal problems, and this caused the team playing far below their average. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_mirage, de_cache and de_train. If the veto goes so VP should be advantaged on Mirage, while Cache and Train are kinda 50/50. Betting odds are overly skewed in favor of the Polish side, while we're more oriented in giving them just a 5% edge, so we're more oriented in taking advantage of the percentages by going Low on G2.
http://csgo.guru/match/2777!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6680!$FSid3!$SK!$FSid3!$0.55!$0.55!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite interesting game since SK in the past couple of weeks improved a lot and finally bounced back after several months of really disappointing results. In the last few days we watched the Danes setting up extremely good fights against most of the T1 teams, and they also somehow managed to roll over NiP, something surely unexpected. Nothing new under the sun for FlipSid3, they are still floating within the Tier2 without the firepower required in order to climb the ranking, but with enough teamplay to don't de-rank to Tier3. Usually their Bo3 performances aren't too bad, and SK despite the promising results are still quite inconsistent on the extended map-pool, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch Fsid3 playing smartly and taking home a 2-1 victory. About maps, in our opinion we'll enjoy : de_inferno, de_cbble and de_overpass. If the veto will go so Fsid3 should be advantaged on Cobblestone, while both Inferno and Overpass are mostly 50/50. Betting odds are trending in favor of FlipSid3, and we agree on this, so our pick is a Low+ bet on them.

Unfortunately for the Germans, this is also one of the Titan signature maps, and probably the one they play better out of the whole map-pool, so we highly doubt we'll watch Scream and friends not taking it home. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+/Avg- bet on Titan, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2779!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6694!$NiP!$mouz!$mouz!$0.55!$0.55!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Extremely relevant game in order to check the current status of both teams. NiP yesterday failed pretty badly against SK, and this is for sure really unexpected after they managed to beat EnvyUs just few days before, and according to the promising results they achieved @ Cluj. However, this match will surely help in order to understand if the yesterday's mistakes were just a case in a grand scheme, or something slightly more serious. On the other hand Mousesports are just back from a brilliant performance @ CEVO Finals, where they hit a 2nd place and offered a pretty nice show during the whole weekend. Surely de_mirage is a tricky map, NiP already displayed their limits on it, while Mouz (despite this is one of their usual picks) frequently play the T side in a quite messy way, not really suitable when facing T1 teams. Overall betting odds are still pretty balanced and we're expecting a quite even game as well, but at our end we're a bit more prone in going Low on Mouz, since we find them slightly more consistent on Mirage.
http://csgo.guru/match/2780!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6695!$Titan!$VP!$VP!$0.5!$0.37!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty nice game, and a match-up we already enjoyed plenty of times in the past weeks. Virtus.Pro are stepping here with the CEVO title in their bag, but despite the trophy their form is just average and not as exceptional as you may believe. However, we need to remember that this game is taking place on de_train, surely a map in favor of the Polish side, and also one of their usual picks. On the other hand Titan are back in their usual Limbo, and they are still kinda inconsistent and they didn't figure out how to deal with the late-game yet. Usually on Train they are decent, but overall kinda below the VP level, so we doubt we'll watch them taking more than 12 rounds or so. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of VP, and we agree on this, so (even if the percentages are a bit too skewed) we're oriented in attempting a Low+ bet on [Pasha] and friends.
http://csgo.guru/match/2781!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6708!$VP!$mouz!$mouz!$0.55!$0.63!$-0.07999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an obvious game as may look at first sight. Virtus.Pro already managed to beat Mousesports on de_inferno during CEVO Grand Final a couple of days ago, however it's important to note that Inferno isn't a VP strong map and overall one of the few ones where the Poles are beatable (as G2 also exposed early today), and we're prone in believing that with some more effort Mouz could have won at least this map. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of VP, while we believe that they don't have an huge edge, and we're mostly talking about a balanced match, so we're oriented in going for an ICB/Low bet on Mouz.
http://csgo.guru/match/2782!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6698!$Na'Vi!$Penta!$Na'Vi!$0.6!$0.86!$-0.26!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say, Penta are still pretty away from their optimal form, and currently they are sitting on a quite terrible streak, so we highly doubt we'll watch the Germans taking down Natus Vincere in a game featuring the Bo3 format. On the other hand we need to say that also NaVi (despite their superb Cluj performance) are having some issues with their online games, and in the short-term they looked kinda shaky and not really on-point, even against quite manageable opponents (ie: Mouz). About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_dust2 and de_mirage. If the veto goes so, we wouldn't be surprised to watch NaVi struggling a bit on Cache, but the following two maps are clearly in their favor. Betting odds aren't really exceptional, and as usual when we talk about 90/10 percentages we really suggest to consider a skip. However, if you want to go for a side anyway, our pick is NaVi.
http://csgo.guru/match/2783!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6691!$HR!$Titan!$Titan!$0.5!$0.48!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy game to predict since both teams are kinda prone to random slumps, and overall they play in a kinda inconsistent way since a while. HellRaisers are usually way more consistent in Bo3 matches rather than in Bo1s, but they are still messing with Schneider and playing with a stand-in is always an slightly issue when we talk about matches taking place against really 'technical' teams such as Titan. On the other hand the French/Belgian side is still extremely momentum-based, and despite they have one of the strongest entry-phases of the whole T1 scene they are still tilting a lot in the mid-late game, facing hard-times in closing the matches despite the advantage. About maps, both teams follow a very similar pattern, so we are almost sure we'll watch : de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, Titan should be advantaged on Cobblestone, while HR may grab Overpass and Dust2 is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are still extremely even, so we may risk a Low bet on Titan, with the hope to watch Scream and friends a bit more focused than usual. Anyway we don't suggest to go with crazy values, since we're talking about a really risky match.
http://csgo.guru/match/2784!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6702!$mouz!$Fnatic!$mouz!$0.45!$0.35!$0.10000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite interesting match-up, Mousesports are surely rolling really fine and their early show against NiP clearly proved that the Germans are turning into a serious contender. On de_overpass they already managed to beat NaVi during CEVO Finals, but honestly this is a bit controversial map for Mouz, since they lack of a proper middle-ground and they rely a lot on personal plays, compared to other maps where they have more structured strats. On the other hand Fnatic are surely one of the best teams on this map, even if lately they stopped playing it as they used to do in the past, and currently they are keeping their focus on different maps. Betting odds are currently pretty skewed in favor of the Swedes, and they have for sure an edge, but honestly with these percentages we're more oriented in attempting a Low bet on Mouz rather than picking an Avg bet on Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/2787!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6703!$WinterFox!$LG!$LG!$0.4!$0.27!$0.13!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Kind of a random game since both teams are used in vetoing de_overpass on a regular basis, so they never put much effort in learning this map properly. On paper Luminosity are for sure slightly advantaged due the higher firepower, but overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch a match slightly closer than expected and moreso pug-like battle. On the other hand WinterFox aren't sitting on a great streak, and the updated lineup still need to develope and acquire some experience, even if it looks promising. Betting odds are rolling in favor of the Brazilian side, and they surely have an edge, so we're oriented in picking an Average bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/2788!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6700!$Method!$LG!$LG!$0.4!$0.1!$0.30000000000000004!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$At first glance this should be a pretty obvious match, but yesterday Method demonstrated an impressive degree of resolve, as they battled back from behind in two consecutive maps to defeat 3sUP in a bo3. This is worth noting cause of the confidence such a game can lend to a team whose stuggled with such a problem in the past. Method has one of longer standing lineups in the NA scene, so yesterday could be a building block towards consistency. Luminosity on the other hand, was more than impressive at Cluj, but has since been a little shaky. On paper, the Brazilians surely sport more firepower, but could face a riskier match against a confident Method. However with extended map-pool for this SLI bo3 they shouldn't have too much issues taking the win. As for maps, we expect to see de_dust2, de_overpass, and de_mirage. Should the veto go this way, Method might take Overpass, while LG should be able to grab Dust2 and Mirage. Currently, betting odds way favored towards LG, which we agree on. So without much reward on an LG bet, a skip is likely the way to go. But if you want to go for a side our pick is LG.
http://csgo.guru/match/2789!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6709!$Liquid!$Conquest!$Liquid!$0.55!$0.56!$-0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$
http://csgo.guru/match/2790!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6705!$coL!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.45!$0.27!$0.18!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Second match in a row on de_cache for Liquid, and honestly we're not expecting any huge surprises. Based mainly on the exceptional shows that Hiko and friends are used to providing on this map. However CompLexity are for sure a slightly tougher opponent compared to Conquest on Cache, and overall they've played it more regularly and with more consistent results. Additionally, they are featuring an extremely well-tuned teamplay lately, with quite a nice (and smart) set of strats. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch coL putting up a good show, and also a final score slightly closer than expected. Betting odds are rolling in favor of Liquid, and this is correct (and pretty obvious), but honestly the percentages are a bit too skewed and we believe we'll enjoy a kinda risky game. So we're slightly more prone to trying our luck with a ICB/Low bet on coL rather than risking an Avg bet on Liquid.
http://csgo.guru/match/2792!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6701!$CLG!$Conquest!$Conquest!$0.5!$0.6!$-0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second game in a row between these two evenly matched opponents. And theres not a much more to say. CLG has cemented their position within the 2nd tier, and remain amongst the best teams in the NA scene. Though they've struggled some with consistency, but to their credit we've never really seen them fall into an extended losing streak. That said, they enter today's schedule following a couple of tough losses against C9 and Mouz. So we mostly expect balanced results coming from the maps they'll have against up-and-coming Canadian crew. Conquest, as we covered frequently over the past weeks, have beeing playing above their level. And honestly, they've been doing so on a consistent enough basis, that the rest of the NA scene should take them seriously, and we should realize they are a legitimate team to watch gradually moving up the ranks. This will be their game of the night, however the bo3 format will likely benefit the more experienced CLG roster. As far as maps go, the veto pattern suggests we'll likely watch de_cbble, de-dust2, and de_train. Though these teams are currently quite evenly matched, the extended mappool should moreso favor CLG, who should grab Dust2, while Cobblestone and Train could go either way. Again, Betting Odds are practically split right down the middle. But on our end we slightly more oriented towards a bet on tarik and friends, but cautiously keep the values Low.
http://csgo.guru/match/2793!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6706!$Liquid!$Cloud9!$Liquid!$0.5!$0.54!$-0.040000000000000036!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another big match and an extremely interesting one, since both teams are usually pretty good on de_cache. And on this map they usually offer good shows on a regular basis. This is also mostly a pure 50/50 match-up, (quite the theme today) Liquid are probably slightly more in form compared to Cloud9 who have lately been experiencing serious issues resulting in their drop from their leading position over the past month or so. However we need to note that yesterday Skadoodle and friends finally managed to bounce back, taking home a couple of pretty relevant victories, while also showing some good signs of improvement after two weeks of free-falling. Betting odds are currently pretty balanced, and just a tiny in bit in favor of C9, so if the percentages keep floating around these values we may try a Low bet on C9. Just to evaluate if they finally managed to solve some of their problems.
http://csgo.guru/match/2797!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6713!$VP!$E-Frag!$null!$0.6!$0.68!$-0.08000000000000007!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Yesterday Virtus.Pro dropped the ball a bit and failed to provide any decent show, but honestly it was kinda expected because despite their CEVO title they weren't really looking in form, so their losses against G2 and Mouz basically demonstrated that. However, E-Frag are surely a promising and well-rounded team, but they aren't comparable with the rosters that the Poles faced yesterday, so despite most of the people are a bit scared by VP (due their recent results) at our end we're quite confident in going with them, and the Bo3 format should ensure an extra layer of security. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_overpass, de_inferno and de_cache. If the veto will go so EFrag may take Inferno but both Overpass and Cache are in clearly favor of VP. Betting odds aren't bad at all, and still pretty decent for attempting an Average bet on [Pasha] and friends, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2798!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6712!$G2!$Penta!$G2!$0.7!$0.92!$-0.22000000000000008!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not much to say, as we stated yesterday Penta surely improved a bit in the past weeks, and despite the final scores they offered quite challenging fights to several T1 teams, something that is for sure promising. However, here we're talking about a Bo2, so the chances of upset are really low, and we highly doubt that the Germans will be able to take home more than a single map (if they're lucky) against Gamers2. Betting odds are already quite terrible, so as usual when we talk about matches featuring 90/10 percentages we highly suggest to evaluate a skip due the really low profitability. If you want to go with a side anyway, our pick is G2 and should be a quite safe one (in the worst case we'll see a Tie).
http://csgo.guru/match/2799!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6715!$HR!$Titan!$Titan!$0.4!$0.31!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$On paper this is quite an interesting game, but in reality, the odds clearly give advantage to Titan since HellRaisers are playing with a stand-in. (Schneider won't play today) on a map (de_inferno) that relies heavily on team-play and good timings. Additionally, HR in the short-term haven't really provided any impressive performances on this map, despite they used to be quite decent at it back in the day. On the other hand, Scream and friends are surely not the 'Gods of Inferno' either, but honestly this isn't even required. A clear and balanced teamplay should be enough in order to take home a victory. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ bet on Titan, so we're oriented in taking this way as well.
http://csgo.guru/match/2800!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6714!$SK!$FSid3!$SK!$0.45!$0.44!$0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Both teams already faced each other yesterday in a match that was crazy close and extremely exciting to watch. Today we'll likely enjoy something really similar, and SK could be able to take their revenge as well, according to how well they performed yesterday and to their recent pretty promising results. On the other hand, nothing really new to say about FlipSid3, their firepower isn't crazy high but they compensate with a smart way to play and good strats, so usually they always manage to offer good fights against T2/3 teams. About maps, there are good chances to watch de_cbble, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, Fsid3 should be slightly advantaged on Cobblestone while both Train and Overpass are mostly 50/50. Betting odds are a bit too skewed in favor of Bondik and friends, while real-world ones are more in the middle, so at our end we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on SK, with the hope to watch them playing as good as yesterday.
http://csgo.guru/match/2801!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6720!$Na'Vi!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.5!$0.45!$0.04999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$After all the changes that in the past hours hit the top-tier EU scene, this is an absolutely must watch game, since it'll be the first match featuring the just updated Fnatic lineup (they switched Pronax with Dennis). Overall we're talking about an extremely balanced game, and on de_dust2 both teams always provided decent shows, however we need to remember that this map used to be one of the very few where Fnatic never managed to play stellar, and where they always been beatable. On the other hand Natus Vincere are generally slightly better on D2, but honestly their current form isn't really amazing, and in the past few days they looked pretty confused (and kinda far away from what they displayed @ Cluj). Betting odds are still floating around the middle, and this is correct. At our end we're slightly more prone in attempting a Low bet on NaVi, mostly because the combo "new player + D2" on paper isn't looking great for Fnatic. Anyway, we suggest to keep values low, since we're talking about a kinda unpredictable and really risky match.
http://csgo.guru/match/2802!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6722!$Dignitas!$VP!$Dignitas!$0.4!$0.28!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another really unpredictable match since Dignitas just changed 2/5 of their roster (Pimp left, Aizy moved to Gamers2 and K0nfig &amp; RUBINO just joined), so we doubt we'll watch the Danes setting up an amazing fight in a such short time. Surely the new lineup is promising, in particular we're really interested in checking in which role will play Rubino, and how well he'll manage to mess with the rest of the team (he's the only Norwegian, and this may bring some issues). On the other hand, Virtus.Pro are obviously advantaged, not just because the Dignitas new roster, but also because de_cache is a map clearly in their favor, and we're pretty sure we'll watch the Poles bouncing back after a quite messy Wednesday. Betting odds are still decent for attempting a Low+/Avg- bet on VP, so we're prone in taking this path. However this game is mostly relevant in order to check the current status of Dignitas, rather than for betting purposes.
http://csgo.guru/match/2803!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6723!$Penta!$Na'Vi!$Penta!$0.4!$0.13!$0.27!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Honestly not much to say, as we stated previously Penta improved a bit, but we don't believe that de_cbble is in their chords yet (basically it never been), so we highly doubt we'll watch them setting up something decent against Natus Vincere, that are way more used in messing with Cobblestone and overall a team quite good at dealing with long-range maps. Betting odds are already kinda trash, and not really profitable, so as usual we don't suggest to waste time with 90/10 matches, however if you want to take a side anyway, our pick is NaVi since they are usually a couple of steps ahead on this map.
http://csgo.guru/match/2804!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6726!$Dignitas!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.28!$0.12!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Dignitas are surely pretty on-fire according to how they're playing against VP right now, and this is a bit surprising since we weren't expecting them to perform so, in particular on de_cache that always been a strong VP map. However, here against Fnatic things are going to be way different, since the Swedes only switched a single player (Pronax for Dennis) and overall they looked pretty on-point against Natus Vincere about an hour ago, so on de_inferno we believe we'll watch them performing as usual without huge differences from their average (at least for now). Betting odds are still decent for going Low+/Avg- on Flusha and friends, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2805!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6725!$SK!$mouz!$SK!$0.4!$0.29!$0.11000000000000004!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$tremely interesting game since SK are playing an hell of a game against FlipSid3 and during the past weeks they delivered a quite long series of consistent performances, so we can't wait to check if they'll try to win the jackpot. On the other hand Mousesports are without doubts in a grace moment, and they turned into a serious contender for a T1 spot. However this is going to be a tricky game, mostly because will be played on de_train, a map that both teams are used to veto on a regular basis. Betting odds are currently heavily skewed in favor of the Germans, while real-world ones have a smaller edge. At our end we're tempted to go with an ICB/Low bet on SK, surely a risky pick, but honestly SK are looking convincingly and throwing them few cents sounds like a decent option.
http://csgo.guru/match/2806!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6735!$Liquid!$WinterFox!$Liquid!$0.6!$0.78!$-0.18000000000000005!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not quite the obvious game as may look at first. WinterFox aren't really the most scary opponent for the top-tier NA teams, but on de_mirage they've already managed to deliver an upset versus Liquid just a week ago. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a good fight once more. Surely back in the day, Liquid weren't performing as well as they are currently. But after-all, de_mirage is always a map kinda prone to weird results (within the NA scene). So despite Liquid having the obvious advantage here, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a final score closer than expected. Betting odds are still decent for going Avg on Liquid, and this is ok, but we suggest to be careful and avoid crazy values. Even if we believe we'll watch Liquid taking home a victory it won't be a one-side show.
http://csgo.guru/match/2808!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6736!$LG!$Liquid!$LG!$0.5!$0.43!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Another busy NA schedule tonight, featuring several top-tier matchups. The first of the those being between Liquid &amp; LG. After quite a disappointing Cevo playoffs, Liquid has quickly regained their composure, winning their last 5 games. And now the battle for the top team in the NA scene is more interesting than its ever been. Included in this group are the Brazilians who made their statement during DH Cluj. Luminosity had also had a less than encouraging showing during the end of Cevo S8, but likewise managed to keep moving forward, having also won their last 5 games (although their opponents have not been quite as tough compared to Liquid). So somebody's streak will come to an end today, but they will have a chance at revenge in the second meeting between these two later on tonight. Cobblestone will host this showdown, which is a map neither team has any decisive advantage. LG might have slightly more experience here, but in their previous contest here against Liquid, it was the Americans who dominated their way to victory. And following their impressive wins yesterday, Betting Odds are slightly in favor of Liquid, which we're inclined to agree. But this is surely a pure 50/50 matchup, so a Low bet on Nitr0 and friends is as much as we're willing risk on this entertaining fight.
http://csgo.guru/match/2810!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6737!$coL!$LG!$LG!$0.45!$0.28!$0.16999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$An Interesting match here, since both teams are kind of aligned on de_inferno, and on this map they used to follow a similar pattern of mixed performances. CompLexity aren't too bad, but in the past they've relied way too much on personal performances, instead of focusing on playing with a serious plan, which is extremely important on Inferno. On the other hand Luminosity usually keep this map for really important games, and they rarely spoiler it during their daily routine. So when they end on it, they are always a bit of a question mark, even if on paper they should have an edge over Semphis and friends. Betting odds are way too skewed, and even if LG have the advantage, we're a bit more oriented in playing with the percentages and attempting an ICB on coL, in order to take advantage of the 80/20 odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/2811!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6738!$LG!$Cloud9!$LG!$0.5!$0.48!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the best games we'll enjoy tonight, and also a big classic since these teams have faced each other plenty of times over the past months. Additionally, the map is also quite a frequent one. de_overpass has been played a majority of the time in the previous head to heads. It wasCloud9 who managed to grab the upper hand in their latest relevant contest. However, Luminosity have improved a bit (while C9 went down) since then, and they've also put up quite a good show against [NaVi] during Cluj. This is something definately commendable since the CIS side is one of the best ones on this map. However, current betting odds are sitting in the middle and still moving a bit, but if they'll keep floating around these values we're oriented in going Low on Cloud9, since they are usually a bit more solid on this kind of map. With the hope of watching them play in-line to their game yesterday against coL (that took place on the same map).
http://csgo.guru/match/2813!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6739!$Liquid!$LG!$LG!$0.5!$0.47!$0.030000000000000027!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite the matchup to end todays games. Its the second match of the evening between these top-tier rosters, and the fifth scheduled match of the night for the Brazilians. As we covered earlier, both teams are entering today riding a 5 game winning streak, but at least of them will see that ended by the time they arrive for this one. Liquid has had their bumps along the way, but they've continued to be one of the more consistently solid teams out of NA. Recently they've surely noticed this position has been getting a little crowded lately. Luminosity can be endorsed with the same argument, particularly after some exceptional perfomances against some the highly talented EU teams. We've already discussed the key points contributing to this evenly balanced matchup, so we'll minimize the redunancy. For their second contest, this FACEIT game will be on de_dust2. Theres not a tremendous edge awarded to either team, as both teams have won here against lower ranked teams, while both struggled a bit versus the tougher opponents. The last time the these two battled here, Liquid edged out a 16-14 win. So once more, we 're looking at another pure 50/50 contest. Which again reflected with balanced odds. As with the first match between the two, we're moreso inclined towards picking a Low bet on Liquid due to their performance last night. (However, the outcome of the first match tonight between these two may better guide an appropriate pick, in addition to which team gains momentum coming into this one.)
http://csgo.guru/match/2814!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6746!$VP!$G2!$G2!$0.5!$0.55!$-0.050000000000000044!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the most interesting games of this evening. Gamers2 are running extremely hot since Cluj (they had some stuttering right after, but they are already back on the right path), but we need to remember that they just switched Dennis for Aizy and this may bring-in some issues on a technical map such as de_train and against an experienced roster like Virtus.Pro. However G2 already proved that they know how to deal with the Poles, and on this map they already managed to beat them twice in the short-term, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing fine again, and they fully deserve a 50% percentage. On the other hand VP aren't experiencing their brightest moment, and their form is currently way below the average and honestly we don't find them as a really reliable pick. Betting odds are pretty balanced, and this is correct, but at our end we're slightly more prone in going Low on G2 since VP in the past few days looked a bit too off for our taste.
http://csgo.guru/match/2815!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6749!$NiP!$VP!$NiP!$0.42!$0.35!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another top-tier game, this time featuring NiP and once again Virtus.Pro. Here things are a bit less complex than in the previous match, since F0rest and friends in the short-term experienced heavy issues on de_mirage, and overall we highly doubt they'll manage to take down VP in one of their signature maps. As we already stated before, VP aren't rolling too well, but after-all Mirage is Mirage, and here they usually perform fine even if their form isn't really top-notch. Betting odds are widely skewed in favor of the Polish side, and honestly we agree on this trend, so our pick is a Low+ bet on VP. However, we don't suggest to go with crazy values, even if the Poles are advantaged, NiP are always a tricky opponent to face.
http://csgo.guru/match/2816!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6751!$VP!$EnVyUs!$VP!$0.45!$0.39!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Well, not an easy game to predict. Historically Virtus.Pro always been pretty consistent on de_cache, but what they delivered yesterday against Dignitas is simply awful, and extremely far away from the great things they used to show on this map during late summer. As icing on the cake Dig were also playing with their brand new lineup, so basically VP lost against a mix that didn't even had time to setup complex stuff. This surely ringed more than a bell in our heads. On the other hand, EnvyUs are actually one of the most solid teams on Cache, unlike VP they didn't experience any really relevant down-peak and they rolled over most of the other T1 opponents on a regular basis, so they are stepping into this match as clearly favored. Betting odds are way too skewed. Surely EnvyUs deserve a clear advantage, but percentages should be around 60/40 while current ones are edging the 80/20. Way too much for a T1 contest. So even if we're a bit scared by the performances provided by the Poles during the past week, we're oriented in picking an ICB on them, since this is simply the smarter thing to do according to the current odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/2817!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6752!$Fnatic!$NiP!$NiP!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$An extremely balanced game we highly suggest to watch. Both teams faced some issues in the past weeks, Fnatic are the ones that dropped in performances (and from their leading position as well) more noticeably, and this leaded to the yesterday's lineup changes (Pronax out, Dennis in), and according to their entry games, the updated lineup looks kinda promising and sports a quite high raw firepower. On the other hand NiP are floating in Limbo since a while, they are extremely inconsistent but still extremely dangerous in T1-T1 matches, and overall pretty unpredictable and prone to random slumps. On de_train both teams always displayed good things, so we don't really understand why the Betting odds are so skewed in favor of Fnatic. However, since real-world ones are more around the middle, at our end we're oriented in playing with the percentages by picking a Low bet on NiP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2818!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6788!$G2!$VP!$G2!$0.5!$0.55!$-0.050000000000000044!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Surely a pretty interesting match. Gamers2 are actually rolling pretty fine, and the lineup changes they underwent early this week didn't slow them down too much. In the past few days they already faced VP a couple of times, and honestly they looked in way better form compared to the Polish side. Yesterday in particular they provided a stellar performance on de_train, something a bit unexpected since PASHABICEPS and friends are generally pretty good on this map. However, today things are going to be a bit more complex. Virtus.Pro are usually quite decent on de_cache, and less than 12hrs ago they negated the shame of their loss against Dignitas (4-16) thanks to an impressive victory over EnvyUs (16-4). Its probably a bit too early to say that VP are back, but honestly we believe we'll enjoy a balanced game, and with some effort VP could take home a victory. Betting odds are trending in favor of G2, mostly because all the hype surrounding them due to their recent results. But as we stated above we believe that the Poles will have their chances to shine, so we're oriented in taking advantage of the skewed odds by going Low on VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2819!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6754!$LG!$WinterFox!$LG!$0.65!$0.89!$-0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$First game of the iBUYPOWER Cup, currently taking place in Santa Ana, California and featuring a $100,000 prize-pool. Overall we're not expecting any real surprises. Luminosity are generally pretty consistent on Lan, and their latest online performances were quite on-point, without too many blind spots or major issues. However, we need to remember that the Bo1 format can always be kinda random, especially on Lan, so there is always room for upsets. On the other hand, WinterFox haven't provide any extremely convincing performances yet. The new full-NA lineup looks promising, but they are still ways off from most of the top-tier contenders in most of the crucial maps. Betting odds are obviously in favor of LG, and we agree on this trend, however percentages aren't really profitable and currently pushing the 90/10 threshold, so we highly suggest to evaluate a skip. If you want to bet anyway, our pick is Luminosity.

The last time we watched Renegades in (international) action was during the Crown's Invitational, where they managed to put up an amazing fight against VirtusPro during their above average performance. In the following local games they did well too, but as usual we don't really consider these kind of low-tier matches as extremely relevant. Surely they are moving here with a big question mark over their heads, but the Bo1 format can potentially help them in serving an unexpected upset. On the other hand ,CLG aren't currently enjoying their brightest of moments. They've had plenty of issues throughout the past weeks, and along with C9, they are one of the NA teams that have been less than impressive during the 'post-Cluj' time span. However, we need to remember that they usually step-up quite a bit in LAN games, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing better than what they've offered over the short-term. Betting odds are still extremely balanced, but at our end we feel safer in going Low on CLG rather than gambling with the Renegades mystery box.

Their online performances over the past weeks have shown signs of positive direction following their post-Cluj implosion, but they still have work to do. Normally C9 played well pretty well on Lan, but our confidence in this was shaken at DH, so this weekend should offer us better insight as to whether this was a fluke. Meanwhile Conquest has offered repeated indications of continued progress. They nearly blew a 14-2 lead in last match vs coL, but kept their cool to grab the win in a thrilling 3rd OT. And their most recent lan outing was another commendable effort at the CEVO S8 Finals, where they made it to the quarter-finals before Mouz eliminated them 2-1. Compared to where they were just a few months back, theres no debating their development. Again we have the makings of pure 50/50 contest, while Betting Odds are slightly favoring C9. Considering the most recent lan performances of the two, we more inclined to playing the percentages and going Low on Conquest.

Liquid is still among the NA top tier, and over the short-term they haven't faced much issue in defeating their first opponent of the day. Nitr0 and friends have been mostly on-point in their online performances, however they haven't been as successful on lan. So this should make for a good entry match for their lan weekend. On the other hand CompLexity has been a bit of a question mark over the past few months. Their position has slipped some amongst the NA ranks as well, but to their credit, lately they have shown encouraging sparks and some promising signs, but they're still ways off from where they were earlier in the month. Betting Odds are currently skewed well in favor of Liquid, which is to be expected, and though we feel coL may put up a better fight than these odds would project, we still agree with the trend. Percentages are still changing, but remain rewarding enough for an Average Bet in Liquid.

On this map Titan provided a long series of mixed performances, but honestly they aren't too bad at it, they always start with the pedal to the metal, but they are extremely prone to tilting during the late game, so going with them is always a bit risky. On the other hand, Virtus.Pro on Cobblestone never really managed to go above the 'just average' level, they always suffered a lot in maps featuring a long range warfare, and usually they rely way too much on personal plays and over-simplified strats. Both teams already faced each other on this maps just a week ago, and VP managed to take the upper hand, but honestly the game it self was pretty close, so we can't agree on the overly skewed betting odds in favor of the Polish side, and we're more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Titan.

HellRaisers are stepping in this game without an official 5th yet, and S1mple will fill the spot. Surely a promising thing since HR experienced their best moment with the young talent playing. However, we need to remember that both HR and Titan are two extremely momentum-based teams, in particular on de_overpass, where they never really played in a structured way, but they always improvised a lot and relied on personal plays. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Titan, mostly because they managed to win their latest h2h on this map and due their slightly better short-term stint. However at our end we're prone in considering this game as a quite even one, so we don't see any reason for not trying to gamble a bit with the percentages by going Low on HR, with the hope to watch them slightly more focused than the last days.
http://csgo.guru/match/2825!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6787!$VP!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.55!$0.55!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the greatest games we get to enjoy this evening, and an even more interesting one now that Fnatic switched Pronax for Dennis. Virtus.Pro, despite the tremendous fail they achieved yesterday against G2, always provided consistent shows on de_train, which has always been one of their signature maps. Now we should keep in mind that their form is slightly below the average, as this may provide some issues against teams featuring a very aggressive play style. On the other hand, Fnatic are still in a phase where they are adapting to the roster-changes, and even though their initial test runs were positive, yesterday's game against NiP showed that they still have to work a bit in maps where smart stats and coordination are required virtues. Betting odds are rolling in favor of VP, and this is correct, even if we're not prone to giving them an edge greater than just a 5%, considering Fnatic are a team that learns quickly, and what didn't work yesterday could already be addressed in time for today's games. Overall we're still talking about a quite balanced game, so we might try to go Low on Fnatic in order to grab a slightly better reward.

Conquest is waiting here after an extremely disappointing and discouraging entry game againt Cloud9, who looks to have woken up, much to the Canadians' misfortune. Conquest only managed to win a mere 4 rounds. After they way they've performed over recent weeks, this was a bit surprising. Since then, they've a little time to sit and think about it waiting for the chance to redeem themselves. CompLexity on the other hand, dont have much to hang their heads about. They fought to the bitter end after fumbling a lead to a strong Liquid team. Granted, it wasn't their best showing either, but both teams left that match knowing it could've just as easily gone the opposite way. So coL may be coming at Conquest aggressively, which should match their playstyle. This will hopefully lead to good show for us. Betting Odds are obviously trending infavor of CompLexity, which after the first matches we're inclined to believe. (but have since this was written, moved back in favor of Conquest) But on our end, we feel the marginal score Conquest lost by, was more attributed to C9 finally getting back to form, and less theirown failure. For this reason, we have real world odds at 50/50. So we're going Low on Conquest, with hopes of seeing them getting back to form

Yesterday Virtus.Pro managed to roll over Titan in a pretty easy fashion, despite we were expecting a slightly closer score. Overall, the Poles looked a bit revitalized compared to early this week (even if their performances against G2 and Fnatic were still below the average). However, on de_cbble NiP always provided mixed results as well, so overall we're not talking about two teams that have Cobblestone as one of their signature maps, and we're expecting a quite balanced game, even if on paper F0rest and friends are looking a bit more on-point compared to the Polish side. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of VP, but as we stated above this is a pure 50/50 game, and at our end we're more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on NiP, since in the post-CEVO weeks we found NiP more focused and reliable than VP, additionally percentages are also slightly more rewarding.

Luminosity are joining this match with a couple of solid victories in the bag (16-0 &amp; 16-5), and also with a pretty long winning-streak on record. They are currently, basically the most reliable and in form American team of the past two weeks, and here they are clearly aiming for a victory. On the other hand Cloud9 used to be the 'old kings' of the NA scene, but since Cluj they started having serious issues and an extremely low consistency. Currently they are barely top-3 despite they still having the potential to take the throne again. Talking about the current match, in our opinion we'll watch : de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_train. If the veto will go so, C9 should be advantaged on Cache, while LG will likely grab Overpass and Dust2 can easily go both ways. Betting odds are still floating around the middle, but in our opinion Luminosity are looking more motivated and a bit more in form compared to C9, so we're oriented in going Low on them rather than gambling on the relative randomness of N0thing and friends.

Virtus.Pro are surely superior to Titan on de_train, and they've proved this plenty of times already. But we should keep in mind that Shox and friends are an extremely momentum based team, and they are quite used in providing random peaks (they did it vs NaVi @ CEVO Finals) and we wouldn't be surprised to see this happen again today. Especially now that VP are looking a bit shaky and not really focused (and we clearly watched these issues showing up yesterday vs Fnatic, and the map was Train). Betting odds are currently rolling in favor of VP, and this is accurate since they are obviously favored, however these percentages aren't really fine since they are not reflecting the current form of the team. So once again we are more prone in attempting an ICB/Low bet on Titan rather than gambling on a team who throughout the whole week provided extremely unreliable shows, in addition to the fact they were on maps where they used to be really good.

However, we should keep in mind that NiP just like the aforementioned Polish side, are a couple of teams that always been pretty consistent on Train, and here they used to be a major threat for most of their T1 opponents. Titan, as we stated in the previous game as well, never excelled on this map, but due to their random peaks they are a team extremely hard to read and kinda unpredictable. Betting odds are trending in favor of NiP, and honestly this time we're kinda prone in following them since the Swedes yesterday managed to achieve a pretty beautiful victory over Fnatic on Train, and overall they are looking more reliable. Anyway we don't suggest to go with values above Low.

However we need to say that usually they always managed to setup decent fights on de_overpass, and most of the times looked quite comfortable on it, even without fielding super complex strats or a perfectly timed teamplay. On the other hand Virtus.Pro used to be quite decent as well, even if lately they started preferring Cobblestone for their daily routine, but overall we expect the Polish side to be advantaged. Betting odds are still quite balanced, so we're oriented in taking a safe approach by going Low on VP.

Historically Cache has always been a strong Virtus.Pro map, but lately the Poles started having serious issues with it, and in the past week they've collected an surprising amount of fails. So in these days we're really cautious when comes to this map and VP. On the other hand, HellRaisers used to play Cache in a pretty good way too, even if playing with a stand-in (Schneider) surely brings-in some teamplay issues, however we find this map as slightly more suitable for an upset compared to the previous one, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch HR setting up a serious fight. Betting odds are again pretty balanced, but this time we're more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on HR, since we find them quite dangerous on this map and because VP could still be a bit off after 4 games played in a row.

Liquid vs CLG is a derby we've experienced plenty of times over the past months, and a game that is always extremely exciting to watch. Liquid are stepping into this match after two contests where they had to fight pretty hard in order to grab the upper hand. They risked a lot in the entry game vs coL, and few hours ago against Cloud9 they experienced some issues in the mid-game phase, but they managed to close the game mostly due to a couple of mistakes at the C9 end. On the other hand CLG had a terrible start (they lost by measure vs Renegades), but then they woke up and handled the following two games in pretty smoothly, winning them both in a quite convincing fashion (even if Wfox and Reneg aren't really comparable with coL and C9). Talking about the current match-up, we believe we'll watch : de_cache, de_train and de_overpass as maps. If the veto will go so, Liquid should be advantaged on Overpass, while both Train and Cache are basically 50/50. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of Hiko and the gang, and even if we agree on this trend and surely Liquid are more consistent on the extended map-pool, we believe that real-world odds should be just 60/40 (we're talking about a Lan game after all). According to this, we're more oriented towards gambling with the percentages by going Low on CLG, with the hope to watch Tarik and co. taking the match to map3.

However, we cannot deny that GuardiaN and friends are currently experiencing a slump. In the past week the performances they've provided were way below their average potential. On the other hand, the updated Fnatic roster is still gonna be a bit inconsistent, but overall it looks promising and they should be advantaged on the extended map-pool. About the veto session, in our opinion we'll watch : de_inferno, de_train and de_dust2. If these will be the maps, Fnatic should be able to grab Inferno, while both Train and Dust2 are mostly 50/50. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Fnatic, and we agree on this since we find them a bit more consistent than NaVi. However, we wouldn't be surprised to watch the game going to all 3 maps. For this match-up we're a bit more oriented in playing our cards safely, so our pick is a Low+/Avg- bet on Fnatic.

Considering at the CEVO Finals Mousesports had experienced a 'graceful moment' where they were way more dangerous than what we're used to seeing from them, at least against Tier1 teams. Surely the 16-0 loss against SK came a bit unexpectedly, but overall we're not oriented in considering it extremely relevant to the 'big picture', but moreso like a scratch in an overall good set of performances. On the other hand, Virtus.Pro recovered a bit from a couple of terrible weeks, and during the past few days they've finally appeared to be revitalized. Currently they're sitting on quite a decent streak, but we need to remember that de_dust2 has never been one of their favorite maps, and messing with Mouz on this map is not going to be a cakewalk. Betting odds are still floating around the middle, and this is correct since we're talking about a mostly pure 50/50 game. At our end we're slightly more prone in risking a Low bet on Mouz, mainly because they often play in quite high form and the map it self.

However, we highly doubt we'll watch them taking down TSM, one of the most solid T1 teams out there, in particular since we're talking about a Bo2 contest. Nothing else to add. Dupreeh and friends should be able to take home a clean 2-0 victory, and in the worst case a Tie, so we consider a bet on TSM as a quite safe one. Just keep in mind that Betting Odds are not going to be great, and as usual we highly suggest to just skip when the percentages are around 90/10.

Unfortunately, their raw firepower is still pretty low. And even though they are capable of compensating the lack of firepower with teamplay, this is not really possible against perfectly structured T1 opponents. On the other hand,EnvyUs should be advantaged on basically the whole map-pool, so there are also good chances to watch a 2-0 victory. However we need to note that the current Betting Odds are basically already trash and edging the 90/10 mark, so as usual when we talk about this kind of games we again highly suggest evaluating a skip due to the extremely low profitability. If you want to pick a side anyway, the way to go is EnvyUs.

We kick off Day 1 with IBP rematch between CLG and Renegades, and the third meeting between the two in 3 days. In their first game, Renegades look to have shown lan promise defeating CLG in their entry game, but in their last meeting, it was the North Americans who gained the upper hand and eliminated the Aussies. And that was after they took an embarrassing beatdown by LG 16-0. So we're not as confident in the Australians' lan form as we were after Crown's Cup. Meanwhile CLG moved onto the IBP semi-finals, only to be swept by Liquid 2-0, and over the past few weeks, we've seen mostly the same inconsistency from the Americans. So they too will look to get off on the right foot to began this 3 day event. For this T2 matchup, we're seeing Betting Odds actually quite mixed, some giving favor to CLG and some to the less active Aussies. On our end, we're not yet fully convinced by the randomness of Renegades so we're giving an edge to the more experienced CLG, so they are our pick for a Low bet.

Enemy hasn't been the scariest of opposition, but over the short-term, they've shown some promising things including an improved focus on teamplay. Although this doesn't always compensate for their lack in firepower. Overall they've been better than in past months, but they've often given up an early lead from which they just couldn't recover. CLG as we covered in their in first match, had a mediocre showing at IBP over the weeken, but did reach the semi finals. But generally their short term performances haven't been above T2 quality. In this contest however, that shold be adequate to grab win over NME without too much issue. As has been the outcome in the previous several games. Betting Odds are expectedly well skewed in favor of CLG, a trend in which we agree. While percentages still remain rewarding, our pick is an Average Bet on Tarik and friends.

And here we actually a potentially interesting matchup, particularly as one we've not yet watched before. Enemy as previously discussed, has shown some improvments in the gameplay in recent weeks, and this is their first lan competition since. By the time this match arrives, they'll have already a pair of games under their belt, so any lan nerves should be gone by this point. So this is should be a contest truly reflective of their skill. Renegades on the other hand, has shown both good and bad things on lan, and are coming off a disappointing weekend at IBP. And from what they've shown over their recent lan competitions, they are a very unpredictable bunch. They have shown some bery promising things, but they've also shown some quite discouraging things as well. So currently, its very difficult to know which to expect. Which is why we feel real world odds are closer to even as 55/45 in favor of the Aussies, while Betting Odds are marginally in favor them. Due to the randomness of Renegades, we're more inclined to chase the greater reward on a Low bet on NME. But if the Australians offer up something very special in their entry game with CLG, then we'll revert to an average on the Aussies instead.

These two have played each other a half a dozen times in the past month. Between this being the first match for both in this RGN Lan event, and their frequently competed history, we should anticipate a strat-heavy fight. Cloud9 ran into some serious issues since Cluj, basically giving up their position at the top of the NA scene. However, as we saw in the past week, they've seemed to worked through their problems and appear back in form. In particular, C9 enter this event as Winners of the IBP Cup and its generous purse prize. So as we transfer into this consecutive Lan event, they are the currently the team beat. They will be using previously banned 'swag' as stand-in for seang@res, but this shouldnt make much difference since hes their analyst and trains with them on a regular basis. CompLexity on the other hand, showed some signs of promise over the past few weeks, but they only managed a single win over the weekend at IBP, and were actually eliminated at the hands of the C9 on their way to the championship. That inferno defeat was by a discouraging 16-5 score. Betting Odds are still moving, but obviously favor Skadoodle and friends, which is accurate after the past week of their exceptional play. Currently odds are still rewarding enough for low-avg bet on Cloud9 continuing the hot run, but dont go too crazy with values in case C9 plays with a winners' hangover.

Especially on a day packed with random bo1s and a handful of surprising results. Method have for sure shown improvement over the last few weeks, particlularly their teamplay. Despite this, they've still not managed to string together several consecutive relevant wins. This is also the first time their playing lan since WinOut, so we're not entirely sure how they perform compared to their inconsistent online games. On the other hand CompLexity have also encountered the same difficultues in the win column. But to their credit, their overall performances have generally been at a level superior Method. They had a disapointing weekend in the IBP Cup, but they did show some very strong fight against Liquid and Conquest. Furthermore, they ran into C9 while they were rolling along on their way to win the the Finals. Betting Odds are appropriately in favor, and remain decent still for an average bet on CompLexity, but with Method being a bit of question mark on Lan, keeping the value Low may be a safer approach.

Liquid are surely playing at a level amomgst the best out of NA. They had a decent lan performance over the weekend at IBP, but just didnt have enough to top CLoud9 in the Grand Finals, but respectably making it that far. Over the past few weeks they've played on-point in their online games, but had terrible lan outings at Cevo and Cluj. But this weekends' IBP showing should dimiss most hesitation concerning their lan play. CSGL on the other, really haven't done much of anything encouraging, and there seem to be some serious issues they're gonna need address. Possible roster changes may even be on the horizon. So we really don't expect to see them pose too much of a threat to nitr0 and friends. However, the two haven't faced each other before, so the absent point of reference could make this a closer contest than expected. Bettings Odds are naturally favoring Liquid, and for all the reasons above we're in agreement. While current percentages remain rewarding enough, our pick is an Average Bet on Liquid, with hopes of them carrying some extra momentum from a commendable weekend result.
http://csgo.guru/match/2851!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6867!$WinterFox!$LG!$LG!$0.6!$0.1!$0.5!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$The Final match of the Round Robin Group Stage bo1s, and the remaining teams out of Group D. This game's match time has been shifted and postponed due to the Day 1 delays, but eventually they'll be playing to determine the final teams to advance to to the bo3 round. Luminosity had really kicked it up a notch at Cluj, and have been mostly playing at a similar extremely high level ever since. And they've additionally been participants in all the recent lan events as well (Cluj, Cevo, IBP and now RGN), so their teamplay should be rather solid for outing. They did however loose some traction in the IBP semi-finals when they got swept by C9. But honestly they aren't in a challenging group here, so their qualifying for the bo3s is surely expected. Winterfox also played at IBP (or at least were in attendance), which was the first lan event for the new NA lineup. Although expectations from them weren't much, it was still a bit surprising to see them only able to win 7 rds between the two IBP games they played, en route to an early exit. And this includes a 16-5 loss to the Brazilians on Saturday. Betting Odds are expectedly already trash, with the LG advantage edging the 90/10 threshold. So as usual, considering a skip is wisest move. Again, unless of course LG craps the bed in their first two
http://csgo.guru/match/2853!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6843!$TSM!$HR!$TSM!$0.6!$0.86!$-0.26!$HIGH RISK!$AVG BET!$First match of the day, but honestly we don't expect to watch any real surprises, since we're talking about a Bo3 and TSM should be able to take it home with relative ease and most likely with a plain 2-0 score. On paper, HellRaisers aren't too bad, but playing against a top-tier and extremely well structured team, such as TSM, without an 'official 5th' is extremely hard. So the Danes have a clear edge on basically all the maps, and the extended map-pool adds an extra layer of protection. Betting odds are still decent for an Average bet on TSM, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2854!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6847!$Dignitas!$VP!$Dignitas!$0.4!$0.34!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not as obvious a match as may look at first sight. Virtus.Pro certainly seem to have recovered from their little slump, and in this last week they've gotten back on track (currently the Poles are also sitting on a quite nice streak), but overall de_cbble is usually quite a tricky map for [Pasha] and friends. Even if in the short-term they started handling it a bit better compared to months ago. They still have some rounds where they're pretty out-of-sync or prone to using too predictable a pattern. On the other hand, Dignitas aren't experiencing their brightest moment. The recent lineup changes haven't really paid off yet, and honestly without Pimp they've started looking a bit unbalanced and not as consistent as they used to be. On Cobblestone, lately they've provided kinda mixed performances, but in reality they are quite decent on this map. And with some luck , they could be able to pul off an upset. Betting odds are rolling in favor of VP, and this is correct, but the percentages are currently way too skewed compared to real-world ones (that are around 60/40), so at our end we might try a Low/ICB bet on Dignitas, in order to take advantage of them.
http://csgo.guru/match/2855!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6850!$NiP!$VP!$NiP!$0.44!$0.43!$0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the greatest games we'll enjoy today, and always an amazing show to watch when these two compete. In particular since it's taking place on a map (de_overpass) that is surely open to surprises. As we stated already in their entry match, Virtus.Pro are jumping here following quite a successful week, where they managed to bounce back in good fashion after their post-CEVO mini slump. Currently they are looking solid again, and even if they didn't face top-3 teams yet, the scores provided against high-T2 and low-T1 ones were all quite convincing. On the other hand, NiP are rolling pretty decently too, but honestly they are always quite unpredictable. Even if they have the potential to beat every T1 team, they are really prone to random fails and huge oversights, in particular in Bo1 matches. Additionally the Swedes stopped playing Overpass a long while ago, and unless some recent (secret) training, we highly doubt they'll manage to provide a performance on par with that of VP. Especially since the Poles are used to playing this map on a regular basis and with satisfying results. Betting odds are trending in favor of Snax and friends, and this is correct, so our pick is VP as well, but due to the level of the teams involved, we don't suggest going with values above Low.
http://csgo.guru/match/2856!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6854!$mouz!$TSM!$TSM!$0.45!$0.32!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty interesting game, Mousesports were in a quite great run early this month, but lately they had to deal with a couple of tough matches and even if their last one against VP didn't go too bad, the previous one versus SK was a complete disaster. Additionally they basically took a break during the past few days, so they are going to step into today's matches a bit colder compared to their opponents. There isn't much to add about TSM, they are pretty on-point and currently sitting on a quite great streak, usually they are fine on de_cache, even if this isn't one of their favorite maps, so on paper they should be able to take home this match with a score around 16-12. Betting odds are still fine for going with a Low+ bet on the Danes, so this is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/2857!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6853!$Fnatic!$EnVyUs!$Fnatic!$0.5!$0.51!$-0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Extremely good match-up featuring two of the teams that battled the most for the top-3 during the past Quarter. Fnatic are moving into this match with the updated lineup featuring Dennis instead of Pronax, while EnvyUs are stepping in the game after a couple of kinda unsuccessful days and after a short-break as well, so the Frenchmen aren't in their best condition and overall their timings looked a bit off. On de_inferno, both teams provided consistent performances in the past, and used to play this map on a regular basis, so we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 fight. Betting odds are still extremely balanced as well, but at our end we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Fnatic, since we find them slightly more in form compared to the French side.
http://csgo.guru/match/2858!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6849!$HR!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.34!$0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite weird game, and not an easy one to predict. HellRaisers are having hard times because despite the good firepower they cannot field a proper teamplay yet since they still have to 'officially' finalize their roster (Schneider is still a stand-in). On the other hand, Natus Vincere are experiencing extremely serious issues, and their brilliant performance @ Cluj is already a moment of the past. Actually Guardian and friends seem unable to provide a consistent gameplay idea, and most of their strats are executed without a proper communication between team members, and this causes a great mess right after the entry rounds. Current betting odds are a bit skewed in favor of NaVi, but honestly this is a game where we wouldn't be surprised to watch an upset, so we're more oriented in attempting a Low bet on HR.
http://csgo.guru/match/2859!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6852!$SK!$Penta!$SK!$0.55!$0.45!$0.10000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not the most relevant game out there, but a quite interesting one since lately SK really stepped up a lot and made an huge jump ahead. Penta did something similar as well, but with way less success, and after a couple of well played games they ended in issues again. On de_mirage, SK always provided their best performances, and we can easily say that this is one of the few maps where they actually really dangerous, however today Percy will play instead of Friis so their firepower will be slightly below their average, and Penta might take advantage of it. Betting odds are a bit skewed in favor of Penta, but honestly this is a pure 50/50 game. Both teams won't be capable to setup a really structured gameplay. At our end we're oriented in going Low on SK, but this is a really risky game, so be careful and avoid crazy values.
http://csgo.guru/match/2860!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6851!$Titan!$Dignitas!$Titan!$0.55!$0.54!$0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$On paper a pretty balanced match, but in reality a game trending in clearly favor of Titan. Historically Dignitas never really focused a lot on de_overpass, even if now with the updated roster they could be slightly more dangerous, but honestly we don't believe they managed to find the time to re-focus on this map yet, and overall we're expecting a kinda pug-like gameplay from them. On the other hand Titan, are generally fine, but as we stated many times already they are quite prone to random slumps, so even if they are advantaged their performances aren't really written in stone. Betting odds are still quite balanced and pretty fine for going with a Low bet on the French/Belgian side, so we're oriented in taking this way as well.

Overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Swedes providing a not amazing show, since most of the T1 teams will likely have issues in a busy schedule like the one we're experiencing today, however we still believe they'll manage to grab the upper hand. Betting odds aren't really amazing, and currently edging the 90/10 percentages, so as usual when we talk about not really profitable matches we suggest to evaluate a skip. But if you want to pick a side anyway, feel free to go with Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/2862!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6858!$EnVyUs!$TSM!$EnVyUs!$0.5!$0.59!$-0.08999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Much likely the most exciting match we'll experience today, and surely an entertaining Top-3 fight. EnvyUs as we stated for their previous game as well, are not jumping into this match in a great form and in the past couple of games they experienced more than a critical issue, but overall this is kinda normal since they took several days off, so they may need a week or so in order to regain their old form. On the other hand TSM are on a way better streak, and even if they had a couple of stutters early this week, they are currently looking pretty solid and more on-point compared to the French side. On de_cbble both teams always provided quite good shows, but we need to note that this is an EnvyUs 'signature map', and the French side always played it way more compared to the Danes, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch KennyS and friends bouncing back. Betting odds are reflecting this historical advantage, and they are currently trending in favor on EnvyUs, and we agree on this, so our pick is a Low bet on Envy.
http://csgo.guru/match/2863!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6860!$Dignitas!$Penta!$Dignitas!$0.55!$0.65!$-0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Might not be the most interesting match at first glance, but could be close one. Dignitas have actually been the stronger group and put together a couple impressive victories, including two big wins over VP (but VP was playing a bit in a rut), however Dust2 isn't a map play the often, and when they have the reults haven't been favorable. Meanwhile Penta has also struggled with issues of consistency, and many of their victories over the last few weeks have come against belowT3 opponents. But they still manage some surpirising wins quite randomly along the way versus VP, NaVi, and NV. But then those were followed up by a losses with non-ranked teams. But Dust2 is map they are surely more familiar on, and this should be enough advantage to even the odds some against the Danish.&gt; Betting Odds are skewed in favor of Dignitas, largely in part because of the wins over VP. But as noted, those were during bad run the Polish were on, so we're not putting too much stock in those wins, which is why real-world odds are 55/45 in Dignitas' favor. But we still feel despite the map, Dignitas is the safe pick for Low bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/2864!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6857!$NiP!$Titan!$NiP!$0.55!$0.57!$-0.019999999999999907!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy game to predict since both NiP and Titan are providing an impressive amount of mixed performances, so we're not really talking about consistent teams but more like momentum based ones. Worth mentioning the curious case of NiP when a week ago lost by measure against Mouz (on de_mirage) and then shortly after managed to beat VP on the very same map, despite the Poles are usually quite great on this map. However, in this case Titan aren't famous for setting up stunning shows on Mirage and most of their latest games on this map went to their opponents (in a kinda easy fashion), so we're quite prone in following the current betting trend and going Low+ on NiP as well.

We already talked about these problems in the previous matches, so we're not going to repeat the whole thing again, but overall we cannot really consider NaVi as a reliable pick yet. On the other hand Virtus.Pro experienced similar issues right after CEVO Finals, but luckily for the Polish side they already managed to solve them, and currently they already bounced back and started providing consistent shows. Talking about the match it self, we need to remember that VP never really enjoyed playing de_dust2, even if lately they started playing it in a pretty good way, so despite NaVi are surely dangerous (in particular on D2), we're more prone in sticking with [Pasha] and friends and picking Low bet on them, since we actually consider them in a better form.

HellRaisers have been on the wrong side of the win column in many their recent contests. [Mouseports] on the other hand, made a statement in their run to the Cevo Finals, and shortly followed it up with couple of key wins over VP and Fnatic. However, their worst loss to date occured on Train, where SK swept the Germans 16-0 (*add fireworks here*). Betting Odds have been movin around quite a bit, and depending where you looks, you'll the advantage going both ways. But on our end, over the short term, Mouz are surely the stronger of the two, and we consider the SK loss on Train to be a blip on and overall improved bigger picture. So we expect to see a different performance from them here today. So our pick is Low Bet on the Niko and friends.
http://csgo.guru/match/2868!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6861!$mouz!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.42!$0.22!$0.19999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last European match of the day, and quite a cool match-up, even if we don't believe we'll watch any huge surprise. Overall Mousesports are surely doing better in these weeks compared to the previous Quarters. But on de_cache they never managed to provide any organized gameplay, nor have they ever fielded a consistent set of strats. So we kinda doubt we'll watch the Germans gain the upper hand against EnvyUs (but we shouldn't forget about the quite poor form showed by the Frenchmen so far today). On the other hand Envyus are historically quite strong on this map, and even if they failed pretty hard against VirtusPro early this week, we still believe that they should be able to provide a more reliable show compared to Mouz. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of kennyS and friends, and with these percentages, we are actually tempted to pick a #yolo ICB on Mouz. Surely Envy has the advantage here, but after a crazy match schedule like the one we experienced today, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a crazy final upset either.

Surely Virtus.Pro aren't facing their brightest moment, but we don't believe they'll face too many issues in rolling over FlipSid3 that today are also playing with a stand-in (Sharia instead of DavCost). As we anticipated, VP are currently on a quite bad short-term streak, but with so many top end tournaments about to go live in the next days/weeks (IEM San Jose &amp; DHW), this is kinda normal and not so relevant. However, we cannot say that the Poles are in a crazy high form, and compared to the rest of the top-tier teams, they're looking slightly below their average. About FlipSid3 as usual there isn't much to write about, in the past few days they didn't play bad at all, and surely their victory over EnvyUs is an interesting result, however we don't believe that without DavCost they'll be able to achieve exceptional stuff, in particular because they always been a really strats-dependent team. Both teams share exactly the same veto-pattern (as you can see in the graph below), so we'll probably watch : de_cache, de_mirage and de_inferno as maps. If the veto will go in this way, Fsid3 may grab Inferno, but Mirage and Cache should be in favor of VP. Betting odds are still decent for an Average bet on the Polish side, so we're oriented in taking this path.

Overall, during the past week the updated Fnatic lineup featuring Dennis, looked quite promising, and achieved a good series of relevant results against most of the other T1 teams around. Everything went well till yesterday, when Flusha and friends fell under the SK shots, surely a quite unexpected result but after-all we should remember that it was a totally useless game for the Swedes, so we're not prone in giving any serious relevance to this outcome. On the other hand, nothing new for the Danes, TSM are rolling well since a long while, and in the past days finalized (in a pretty good fashion) their qualification to both ESL/ESEA &amp; FaceIT, so we've good vibes about them, and actually we believe they are the Top3 team sporting the highest form. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train. If the veto will go so, TSM should be advantaged on Dust2, while both Inferno and Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are slightly skewed in favor of Fnatic, mostly due the hype generated by the roster changes, but honestly TSM are currently slightly more solid and a bit more prepared on the extended map-pool compared to the Swedish side, so at our end we're oriented in going Low on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/2892!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6875!$NME!$LG!$LG!$0.4!$0.12!$0.28!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$We move to the second half of the Upper Bracket Quarter Finals. Luminosity is the first seed out of Group D, but this was mostly expected as they were the only upper tier team of the pack. They didn't dominate to the extent of C9 in the group stage, but their position in group was never threatened. And overall, in the short-term, they've been been one of the most dangerous teams in the NA scene, and with the exception of the IBP semi-finals (eliminated by C9), they've riding quite a hot streak. And they're surely expected to be amongst the finalists for this RGN lan event. Whereas Enemy who are certainly an up and coming NA team with signs of promise. They have actually had a better than average showing through the Group Stage. And actually, they nearly took the top spot before being slightly edged out by the Aussies in tight 14-16 loss. So there is good chance of seeing them put up a strong fight against the Brazilians, but the extended map-pool certainly benefit LG more the Americans. As for maps, we believe we believe we'll see de_cache, de_inferno, and de_overpass. Should the veto go this way, NME has their best chances for a strong start on Cache. LG hasn't focus on this map like they used to, while NME has put up some of their best stuff here. And LG should have the advantage on inferno and overpass, where they've overall showed better things compared to NME. Betting Odds are expected heavily favoring coldzera and friends, and this is appropriate. Currently the percentages are still rewarding enough for an Average Bet on the Brazilains. But if they hit the 85/15 mark, then consider an ICB on NME and hope for the upset.

Cloud9, as expected, has absolutely no issues in advancing to the round. Coming into this event directly from the winners' circle after winning IBP Cup, C9 didnt skip a beat as they rolled through the first round of competition. In the their 3 Group B matches, Skadoodle and friends conceded a mere FIVE round between all three games combined. Even with the inferior opponents, this is very impressive. So they drew the Group C runner-up. Games Academy is below teir 3, and not a team we've covered prior to this event. So our point of reference is as limited as C9's. The Brazilians did show some good things against SKDC and then again in their somewhat surprising victory over CSGL. But honestly, neither of those are a measuring stick for what LG can offer. Betting odds are overwhelmingly in in favor of Cloud9, which of course is to be expected. This honestly isn't even a fair matchup, and with the percentages being a heavy as they are, this must be an automatic skip, and save your skins for the next round. But naturally, feel free to bet on C9 if you gotta pick.

Surely Method did surprisingly well during the first phase of the RGN Finals, and we have to say that they looked way better on Lan compared to their usual online performances. However, facing Liquid is going to be a completely different story. Especially compared to most of the teams they messed with in the Group stage. Overall we highly doubt we'll see Hiko and friends losing this Bo3, and there is actually quite good chances of watching just a plain 2-0. About maps, we'll probably watch: de_mirage, de_inferno and de_overpass. If the veto goes this way, Liquid should be better on all of them, and the only map where we may watch a close game will be Mirage. Betting odds are obviously severely skewed in favor of Liquid, and percentages are currently edging the 90/10 mark. So as usual, when we talk about these kinds of values, we highly suggest evaluating a skip due to the extremely low profitability. But if you really want to bet, then the way to go is Liquid.

Renegades were expected to be one of top two out of Group A, but they impressively took the top seed by going 3-0 on day 1. In fact they looked pretty good as the took the entry game vs CLG, and also as the edged out NME. So the Aussies draw the runner-up out of Group D. Winterfox on the hand, did not look nearly as impressive in the day 1 showings. But they did manage to hang to the wins over their below T3 games. But as expected, offered no threat against LG for the top spot. And in all honestly, we weren't sure they'd even get past Torqued. But to their credit, they survived to move on. Betting odds are expectedly skewed in favor of the Australians, and though they've been a bit of question mark, they really shouldnt have too much issues grab 2/3. However our pick is a Low Bet on Reneagades, mostly because on several maps Renegadess aren't really on point yet.

Overall GA are looking quite dangerous and they play in a way that resembles the LG style, the only difference is that they are still a bit inconsistent, and even if yesterday they peaked, today we wouldn't be surprised to watch them facing slightly more issues due the higher pressure. On the other hand WinterFox are still a bit shaky, and this is quite obvious since it's a kinda new lineup, but we don't suggest to underestimate them, in particular during the entry phase of the match. In the past couple of days they struggled against the top-tier teams, but they improved over time, and this is for sure promising. Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of GA, mostly because the hype generated by their latest game. At our end we kinda agree and they may have a real edge, but these percentages are no-sense and totally off, so according to this we don't see any reason for not attempting an ICB on WinterFox, with the hope to watch a close fight.
http://csgo.guru/match/2908!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6887!$Renegades!$Cloud9!$Cloud9!$0.42!$0.21!$0.21!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$As we stated early today, yesterday night Cloud9 risked a lot against GA, and they really edged a stunning defeat. However, somehow they managed to avoid it, and they are still on their quite brilliant streak, even if that performance ringed more than a bell in our heads. On the other hand, Renegades played the whole RGN event seamlessly so far, without making a single mistake and taking home also several quite tricky Bo1s (such as the one vs CLG, and the following against Enemy). On paper their level is surely lower than C9, but honestly they are not playing bad at all, and considering that C9 are playing with a lineup slightly different than usual (but nothing really relevant teamplay-wise, since Swag his their analyst and trains with them all the time), we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Aussies setting up a decent fight. About maps there are good chances to watch : de_cbble, de_train and de_cache. If the veto goes so, both Cobblestone and Cache should be in favor of C9, while Train is kinda 50/50. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Skadoodle and friends, and we agree on this, so even if percentages are currently not so rewarding we're oriented in going Avg on Cloud9.
http://csgo.guru/match/2909!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6889!$LG!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.5!$0.58!$-0.07999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One of the best matches we'll enjoy today, and always a really nice 'derby of the Americas' to watch, in particular when we're talking about Lan events. Without doubts Liquid are peaking, and they are one of the NA teams that in the short term provided the most solid performances, two days ago they lost the iBP Grand Final by a nose (map3 + OT), and we've to say that it mostly happened due some bad luck rather than clear mistakes or incredible merits at the C9 end. Luminosity didn't experience a similar run @ iBP, and despite they joined it as one of the huge favorites they failed to hit the Grand Final. Anyway here at RGN they are currently on a pretty good streak, and they still have to lose a single match (but we need to say that they didn't face any scary opponent yet). Overall this is a pure 50/50 match, both teams are well aligned and they share a similar veto-pattern together with almost the same victory chances, about maps we believe we'll watch de_cbble, de_cache and de_overpass. If it goes so Liquid may have a slightly edge on Cache, while both Cobblestone and Overpass can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of LG, but as we stated above the real-world odds are simply in the middle, so at our end we're oriented in going Low on Liquid in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/2910!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6891!$NME!$Method!$NME!$0.55!$0.58!$-0.029999999999999916!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty interesting contest, both teams showed promising performances during the past days, and they are surely the couple of up &amp; coming rosters that managed to display the better things during this final part of the NA season. Enemy probably are still a step ahead compared to Method, and Relyks and friends always managed to setup a bit more serious fights against the top-tier contenders, and even if they are still a bit shaky on the extended map-pool they have a tricky pattern of maps where they can be really dangerous. On the other hand Method are the NA team that focused more on teamplay and timings, but despite this is surely a good thing they are still affected by a chronic lack in firepower, and this causes them to suffer a lot against high end teams, or versus lineups sporting a more balanced output. About maps, we'll very likely watch: de_inferno, de_dust2 and de_cache. If the veto goes so, Inferno should be in favor of Enemy, while Method will likely take Cache, and Dust2 can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Enemy, and we agree on this since we believe that they are a bit more consistent and adaptive, but overall we're not talking about an huge edge. However our pick is a Low bet on Enemy.
http://csgo.guru/match/2912!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6903!$NME!$Renegades!$Renegades!$0.45!$0.28!$0.16999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not a bad matchup for this elimination match. Enemy managed a rather strong performance in their 2-0 sweep of Method, and survived to another game. Their first map was a closer contest, but NME stepped it up on Overpass to eliminate Method with respectable 16-3 victory. They surely demonstrated some good strats there, and are sure to carry some confidence with as they move on to face the Aussies once more. In the first meeting of the Round Robin Stage, the Americans actually played quite well, but just fell short in the 14-16 loss on Inferno. SO they'll certainly be out to settle the score. Renegades on the other hand, fell to this lower bracket elimination match following their throw-down with Cloud9. The Australians certainly put up more of a challenge for C9 than most expected, and forced the 3rd deciding map, but C9 really stepped it up a level, and were simply too much for them. But overall, they made a very persuasive argument that they're a legitimate threat. As for the veto, we anticipate seeing de_cache, de_inferno, and de_mirage. Should it play out this way, NME will hope gain advantage on Cache as one of their better maps (although its mostly a 50/50 map), while Renegades should be able to take Mirage if it goes that far, leaving Inferno to the deciding match which could go either. Last match, the Aussies just edged out the win here. Betting Odds are well skewed in favor of Renegaes, which after the C9 fight, we're inclined to agree. So on our end our pick is a Low Bet on the Australians to survive another day.
http://csgo.guru/match/2913!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6908!$Cloud9!$Liquid!$Cloud9!$0.5!$0.56!$-0.06000000000000005!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$So far the most exciting 'on paper' matchup of the evening. Just a few days prior [Cloud9] defeated Liquid in a bo3 to win the IBP Cup 2015. In that match, it was the first map that ultimately decided the result, and OT was required. And since that point C9 has been riding the hot streak out. Liquid meanwhile bounced right back after losing the IBP Finals, and has also ran through this event undefeated. And currently find themselves with the opportunity for some satisfying revenge. So they are essentially varrying the same momentum with them as C9, and now we have the clash of titans (so to speak). As to be expected, Betting Odds are mostly split right down the middle, currently favoring a slight to C9. On our end, we feel this match could surely go either way, but feel slightly oriented in going Low on Liquid, and since the percentages offer a little morte reward in going with them, thats our pick. Looking forward to this one!
http://csgo.guru/match/2914!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6899!$GAcademy!$LG!$LG!$0.42!$0.22!$0.19999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is actually quite an interesting All-Brazil matchup. Games Academy has certainly make a statement thus far in to the competition. They were 1 round away from sweeping Cloud9 yesterday, but as we saw in the first map of that bo1, they have troubles closing out. The experioence of C9 prevailed, and GA found themselves on the brink of elimination versus Wfx. But GA had other plans, and rolled over Wfx 2-0 as if they were an top tier team. Now they arrive here, after an extended wait for their opponent to be determined (due to poor crowd control), and now face the team they're closely modeled after. Luminosity on the hand had also been rolling along, yet to lose a map, until they ran into the Liquid, who in a tightly fought contest (disruptions aside) mange to take 2 and bump LG from their win streak. And now they face their minor league team of sorts in this Lower Bracket semi final. No question LG is the superior team here, but it'll be interesting to see how they play their allies, who play an extremely similar style and strat. Obviously the extended map-pool favors the more experienced LG crew, but overall we need to consider GA has been rather underestimated to this point of the tournament, and have frequently offered some very promising things. SO good chance we'll see this contest go all three maps, with a potential tight score throughout. Betting Odds are expectedly heavily favoring Brazilians Pros, and this is hard to debate. But this the uniqueness of the contest makes it quite difficult to call. With percentages where they are, we more inclined to skipping this one, considering the minor chance we might not see an un-biased complete effort from both sides. But if you gotta pick, LG is safest bet but its more fun to gamble on the wild possibility of GA pulling a 'cinderella story'-esque upset.
http://csgo.guru/match/2915!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6909!$HR!$SK!$HR!$0.55!$0.59!$-0.039999999999999925!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Honestly a pretty random match-up, with a really high risk to see just a Tie and nothing else as final score. Both teams are messing with stand-ins since a while, and they still have to officially finalize their lineups. However, despite the kinda unstable roster, SK managed to deliver a couple of weeks full of impressing shows, and actually we really believe they have a good potential, and probably with some patience they could do even better. On the other hand HellRaisers are still playing with Schneider as 5th, and in the short term they experienced a quite impressive amount of mixed results plus they're following a quite random and unpredictable pattern, so guessing how they'll play today is basically impossible. Even if honestly we don't think we'll watch them failing more than a map, and generally they should be a bit more consistent on the extended map-pool than SK. Betting odds are still quite balanced and not tremendously skewed in favor of Kucher and the gang, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on HR since we find them slightly more reliable.
http://csgo.guru/match/2916!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6911!$Renegades!$LG!$Renegades!$0.45!$0.23!$0.22!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving right along now after numerous delays, so not much time here. Renegades managed roll past Enemy with relative ease in two maps, and now find their skill will be put to a greater test. They faced LG earlier in the Group Stage, where the Brazilians kept the Aussies from earning even a single round in a stunning 16-0 match. However, we don't believe we'll see a repeat of that, but they surely have their work cut out for them. Luminosity on the other, watched their hot streak come to end against Liquid in the upper bracket semi-finals, where they just never seemed to get any momentum going. From there they faced a hometown ally in the Games Academy for kind of a random match. In fact LG nearly saw an earlier than anticipated exit, as the newcomers manged to push LG to the third map, but they were able to hang on for the victory and close out 16-13 to advance. Though we dont feel the 'on paper' comparison between the matches is relevant, since GA is simply an unfamiliar opponent that teams really couldn't form proper strats to fit the opposition. Whereas the Australians have been around awhile, and LG is surely familiar with the style and can strat accordingly. Betting Odds are heavily favoring the Brazilians, which we agree with. Although we're tempted to play the percentages on an Aussie pick, we honestly feel LG learned their lesson against GA and will be all-in for the contest. So our pick is Low Bet on Luminosity.
http://csgo.guru/match/2917!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6913!$Liquid!$Renegades!$Renegades!$0.57!$0.73!$-0.16000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Consolidation Final, and a match that could be way closer than expected. Renegades surprisingly managed to roll over Luminosity with a clear 2-0, something a bit shocking, since the Brazilians were doing quite fine. However, Liquid could be a tougher opponent, and despite the good show and form showed by the Aussies, Hiko and friends are still a step ahead, in the past they always managed to read pretty well the Renegades way to play, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them countering their strats heavily. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_cbble, de_mirage an de_cache. If the veto will go so Liquid should have an edge on Cache, while both Mirage and Cobblestone can go both ways. Betting odds are currently way skewed in favor of Liquid, even if we agree on the trend, these percentages are surely way too skewed and we don't suggest to underestimate the Aussies, so at our end we suggest a Low+ bet on Liquid but if the values drop to 25/75 we highly advice to attempt an ICB on Renegades instead.
http://csgo.guru/match/2918!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6905!$E-Frag!$FSid3!$FSid3!$0.52!$0.52!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$GameAgents League Grand Final, and definitively not an easy match to deal with. As we stated several times already during the past weeks, FlipSid3 are a pretty old-school team, they feature a quite basic but extremely well tuned teamplay, with an heavy focus on timings and executions rather than attempting risky strats or extravagant ideas. This kinda classic game management allowed them to keep their T2 placement without issues during all the past Quarters, but on the other hand never allowed Markeloff and friends to really improve their firepower or step-up, in particular against high ranked T2 teams or T1 ones. Today they're fielding Sharia instead of DavCost, and we're pretty sure that this is something that may provide them more than an issue, since as we stated above their whole playstyle is based on how the team it self works and moves (so a stand-in won't provide any benefit in the short-term, but just problems). About E-Frag, they recovered a bit after a kinda off 3rd Quarter, and actually they are sitting on a really promising winning streak, even if we should remember that most of the opponents they faced in the past weeks were way below the level of Fsid3. Anyway, we cannot deny that the Bulgarians always fascinated us, and when they are on a good day they are fully capable to deliver really good shows on most of the maps. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of FlipSid3, but at our end we've some doubts due the sub involvement, and since we're talking about a Bo5 we believe that there are good chances to watch them playing a bit below their average (after the first map). So we're a bit more oriented in attempting a Low bet on E-frag, and honestly also the percentages are a bit more attractive for taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/2919!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6914!$Cloud9!$Renegades!$Cloud9!$0.7!$0.83!$-0.13!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Well this surely a surprisingly Grand Final, however we also need to note that this whole event featured a crazy schedule, and most of the teams at some point started slumping a bit, in particular the ones coming from iBP Cup held in the days before. However, we cannot deny that Renegades managed to deliver an amazing show so far, and all the stuff they displayed was really on point and quite enjoyable to watch too. On the other hand Cloud9 are clearly advantaged, a default 1-0 in a Bo3 Grand Final is huge, and enough to take home the trophy, additionally we need to remember that this game will be played deep in the night (set to start @ 3am) and the Americans surely managed to relax and sleep more compared to Renegades (that had to battle through the Lower Bracket). Betting odds are obviously in favor of C9, this is correct, and due a relevant score advantage (1-0 default) we're basically forced in suggesting an Avg bet on Swag and friends as well.
http://csgo.guru/match/2922!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6916!$LG!$Cloud9!$LG!$0.5!$0.51!$-0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The best North American game we'll likely enjoy today, and always a great and entertaining show to watch. Cloud9 are heading into this match after their (kinda easy) victory @ RGN Finals, (and that was following their iBP Cup victory as well), and while this event surely demostrated quite good form for Skadoodle and friends, we must also remember that the Grand Final finished just few hours ago and late into the night. So we wouldn't be surprised to see them playing a bit below their full potential due to unstandable fatigue. On the other hand, Luminosity obviously had more time to rest since they had been eliminated a bit early (and in a kinda dumb way). But here we also need to underline that yesterday the Brazilians gave up yet another good chance to shine, and that was after their not so amazing run @ iBP Cup. Their post-Cluj roll has certainly slowed drastically, and the confidence has got come into question. As for the map, de_inferno, it should be quite a balanced one. Both teams generally played it well and with mostly satisfying results. So considering all the factors (LG a bit inconsistent but fresher, and C9 slightly more on point but tired) we believe we'll watch a mostly pure 50/50 match. So at our end, we're oriented in playing the odds and going with a Low bet on Luminosity.
http://csgo.guru/match/2927!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6917!$CLG!$Conquest!$Conquest!$0.5!$0.43!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Together with C9-LG this is the second absolutely must-watch game of today. Conquest managed to setup an extremely disappointing fight during iBP Cup, we were expecting a way better show after the great performances @ CEVO Finals (and the following quite promising online matches). Instead Rush and co. went out after just a couple of matches, both finished with kinda terrible scores. However the good part is that they didn't take part at RGN, this means that they are way fresher compared to most of the teams playing this evening. Obviously we cannot say that CLG aren't fresh as well, since they had to pack their bags pretty quickly at RGN, and as we stated for their previous game, they are currently quite out of form and really prone in playing in an overly messy way, without any real logic or coordination. Anyway de_inferno is a quite balanced map, and in the past both sides offered decent shows on it, so we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game. Anyway, at our end we're slightly more prone in picking a Low bet on Conquest, mostly because we find their recent issues during iBP mostly as an unlucky bump rather than a trend, and overall we find them slightly more reliable than CLG.
http://csgo.guru/match/2929!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6915!$3sUP!$LG!$LG!$0.3!$0.07!$0.22999999999999998!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$The only game on tonight's NA schdule not out of ESL, and another best of three for Luminosity who've had an extremely busy week, a frustrating end to two otherwise well played tournaments, and two more games before even coming into this one. We've already discussed the run the Brazilians have had over the last several weeks since DH, but above all, they're to be considered one most solid team of the NA. 3sUP meanwhile, have had some time while the festivities of the past week occurred, to work on their own and hopefully properly prepare on more maps in order to compete with the big names out NA. And tonight they'll hope to seige advantage of the lengthly schedule LG has gone through in the short-term, particularly the last three days, and the potential for fatigue to play a factor. Its kind of unique situation to be honest. Theres a positive and a negative to take from this being a multimap game. LG is stronger on the extended map-pool (positive), but they've played so many games recently and multiple late nights in Santa Ana so the extra maps could possibly a negative affect on their performance. So despite the tilt of the betting odds on this game, it is still a bit of a tricky one at the same time. Percentages are already trash, the standard guru 'evaluate skip' protocol is in place. But if you got a pick...you do only live once, ICB optional.
http://csgo.guru/match/2932!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6947!$G2!$CLG!$G2!$0.6!$0.9!$-0.30000000000000004!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$First game of IEM San Jose, and quite an interesting one to kick things off. Particularly since it features Gamers2 who in the past weeks have turned into one of the hotter trending European teams, following their great performance at DH Cluj; and CLG who are currently looking for some glory after a couple of pretty disappointing weeks. During that time they failed to impress at both the iBP Cup and RGN Championship (to be honest they are only playing this event because EnvyUs decided to step back due flight &amp; securty issues). The Bo3 format is surely in favor of G2, the EU mix finally started rolling well on the extended map-pool, and in their current state, they're surely way more dangerous than CLG. However we should keep in mind that Maikelele and friends took a quite long break just before this event, and they haven't been playing any official matches for about a week. This is surely something of relevance, especially since they are facing teams that have been playing on a daily basis throughout the entire month. So we're oriented in believing that G2 could be a bit rusty, and not quite on par with their most recent outings, so their entry games may be slightly closer than expected. As for maps, there are good chances of watching: de_cache, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto goes so, CLG may grab Train, while G2 should be a step ahead on Cache, leaving Mirage which is going to be slightly in their favor as well. Betting odds are currently way too skewed and mostly nonsense, obviously CLG has failed pretty hard over the short-term, but basically G2 didn't play at all, and data older than 2-3 weeks should be considered very carefully when we talk about International matches involving two teams that never faced each other. We're absolutely confident that G2 are advantaged, but with these percentages, the smartest thing to do is probably to play the odds and go with an ICB on CLG.
http://csgo.guru/match/2933!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6946!$Cloud9!$TSM!$TSM!$0.4!$0.17!$0.23!$MEDIUM RISK!$ICB BET!$One of the most interesting contests we'll enjoy this, the first day of IEM San Jose. Cloud9 are stepping into this match with two new shiny trophies stuffed in their bags, since they managed to take home first place at both iBP Cup and RGN. Overall they surely showed an impressive jump forward after a terribly played 3rd Quarter well below their average. On the other hand, there isn't much to say about TSM, since they are currently the most reliable European team around, and also the one currently featuring the best form. The Danes are usually pretty on point on the whole map-pool, in particular on Lan matches. So in this event, they are surely going to be the toughest opponent to face, and also the favorite for a final victory. About maps, we're pretty sure we'll watch C9 trying to disrupt TSM's advantage a bit, by handling the veto a bit weirdly (even if the TSM advantage is in place on basically every map, as stated above). But nevertheless, we still wouldn't be surprised to watch the third map be needed as well. And there are good chances to see : de_cache, de_overpass and de_dust2. If the veto yields this selection, both Cache and Dust2 are basically 50/50, while Overpass should be in favor of TSM. Just like the previous match, betting odds are currently way skewed in favor of the EU side. In this case, TSM are sporting percentages floating around 80/20, and this is surely a bit unexpected, considering the fact C9 are moving here after dominating two consecutive Lans. However, we cannot deny that the Danish side still have an edge. It's pretty obvious, but since we're messing with values featuring a really low profitability (for going with the favorite team), we might attempt another ICB, in this case on C9.
http://csgo.guru/match/2934!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6948!$Na'Vi!$LG!$Na'Vi!$0.5!$0.64!$-0.14!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$On paper this is without a doubt the most balanced game we'll enjoy during Day 1 of IEM San Jose. Both teams exhibited several flaws over the past weeks. Specifically, Natus Vincere fell encountered quite a serious crisis immediately following their great show @ Cluj, and currently they haven'y yet managed to bounce back yet. Luminosity appeared to be one of the most reliable American teams throughout the past 6 months, and never stepped out from the Top-3 NA. They always kept played consistently, however @ iBP Cup and RGN Championship, they spoiled their huge opportunity to shine, where in both cases, they went out in a pretty dumb way. Despite the very convincing performances showed duing the Group Stage, as well as the community's high hopes. This game is surely a tricky one to predict. [NaVi] are obviously more the experienced compared to Luminosity, but on the other hand, they always demonstrated some limits when fighting the Brazilians. And most of the previous H2Hs they finished with extremely close scores that were mostly decided by a couple of lucky personal plays rather than a just an overall superior gameplay. As for maps, this time we believe we'll watch : de_overpass, de_cbble and de_dust2. If the veto goes this way, NaVi should have a slight edge on Overpass, while both Cobblestone and Dust2 are basically 50/50. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of NaVi, but honestly we're mostly talking about a balanced match, where both teams share equal chances to take home a victory. Even if GuardiaN and friends are looking a bit stronger due to their long term history, we don't suggest considering them too extremely reliable, so based on the skewed percentages, we're oriented in picking just another ICB, but this time on LG.
http://csgo.guru/match/2935!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6949!$Liquid!$VP!$Liquid!$0.42!$0.36!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Most likely the 2nd really balanced match (after NaVi - LG) we'll experience in the IEM San Jose Quarters. Virtus.Pro have fallen on some pretty hard times directly following their CEVO Finals victory. Most of the following matches didn't end well at all. Condemning the Poles to a slump that seriously resembles that of NaVi. However, it's important to remember how VP generally step up in Lan events compared to online games. We should additionally note that the Polish side sports a way more solid roster compared to NaVi. So even if there are similarities between their slumps, several other attributes still remain marginal. On the other hand, Liquid over the short-term have displayed some promising things. Their performance @ iBP Cup was easily in line with what we saw from C9, and stats-wise, their 2nd place has pretty much the same value of a victory, since it happened on map3 + OT. This basically means that both the finalists were perfectly aligned. About RGN, we don't suggest taking these results too seriously, since the schedule was just crazy and most of the outcomes had been seriously influenced by delays and late-night matches. Regarding maps, we believe we'll watch : de_overpass, de_cache and de_mirage. If this is how the veto unfolds, VP should be advantaged on both Cache and Mirage, while Overpass can go both ways. Betting odds are trending in favor of the Poles, but are currently still acceptable for a Low+ bet on them. So even if we're confident that Liquid will manage to push the game to map3, we believe that on the extended map-pool VP are a slightly more reliable pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/2967!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6973!$G2!$TSM!$TSM!$0.42!$0.34!$0.07999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We're a little more than half way through IEM San Jose, with the challenging single elimination bracket, we now know the first teams to advance through the Quarter Finals. The semi-finals will begin with probably not the most interesting of matchups, but one that might be a closer fight than might appear at first. Gamers2 has actually been rolling along for a little while now, and kinda surprisingly make fairly quick work of making CLG the first team to go home. In that contest, G2 only needed 2 maps to wrap things up, despite a close first map that needed OT to decide. But on Cache, the Europeans stepped it up a level, and quickly made it a lop-sided affair. Anyway things won't be getting any easier for them moving forward, but the streak will certainly get put to the test. Menahwile TSM wasn't quite as convincing in the entry game, but while G2 was handling a shaky CLG crew, the Danish were fighting it out with the hottest NA team in C9, who came here directly after winning back to back lan events (IBP &amp; RGN). So we can surely say G2 didn't have the same degree of opposition as TSM, but the Danes still manged C9 to their will to advance to the semi-finals. As we mentioned on the first, TSM are the probable favorites to win the whole event, and their 1st round performance didn't give any reason to waiver on that expectation. But they could be running into G2 at the right time for TSM to be really tested. As we look at veto, we expect to see de_dust2, de_train, and de_mirage, and should the selection follow this Dust2 will make for quite an interesting map. TSM surely has greater experience here, but G2 has put some of better shows against strong EU teams here (TSM excluded). So TSM has just a slightly advantage here, but this may be the key map if G2 aims to upset. Train on the other hand gives advantge to G2, since TSM really don't play it often, nor have they had the best results here. Leaving Mirage, which also favors TSM, but we should point in recent weeks G2 has shown some improvments here the few times they've played it. So overall, we might be looking at quite a decent match. Betting Odds are expectedly favoring TSM, especially when veiwing the tilt of results when these two have played, but the percentages certainly remain rewarding still for our pick for TSM appearance in the finals. But we also caution keeping the value Low since G2 has made a habit of winning some unexpected contests.

Liquid are stepping into this game after a mind blowing performance against VirtusPro, surely we were expecting an even game, but bloody hell a plain 2-0 with scores like 16-2 and 16-9 is definitely embarrassing for the Polish side, and we cannot even point out the absence of Snax as the main problem, since VP basically failed on everything without even understanding the quick plays that Liquid was setting up. On the other hand, Natus Vincere faced a way harder time against Luminosity, but honestly we need to say that Guardian and friends really didn't impress. During the whole match they mostly took advantage of the nonsense mistakes that the Brazilians were repeatedly doing. On Mirage LG totally failed the T side and they could have handled the late-game way better and in a less 'egoistical' way (rip teamplay). Additionally at some point looked like they simply gave up and the last couple of rounds weren't anything different than random rushes (despite the close score and there was still room for a tie + ot). Things had been handled a bit better on Overpass, but a questionable CT side condemned them into the OT hell, where the more experienced NaVi managed to end the series with a straight 2-0. Overall this is a pretty balanced match, and mostly a pure 50/50, but Liquid without a doubt created more occasions so far compared to NaVi, and in a Semi-Final this is something that can make a clear difference. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_overpass, de_mirage and de_cbble. If the veto goes this way, NaVi should have a clear edge on Mirage, while Overpass should be in favor of Liquid and Cobblestone kinda 50/50. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of NaVi, due their wider experience, but as we stated above, Liquid looked pretty convincing till now, and a bit more adaptive compared to the CIS side. Additionally percentages are also a bit more rewarding for going with the Americans, so at our end we're oriented in risking a Low bet on Liquid, with the hope to watch Hiko and friends on-point as yesterday.

After such a crazy week of RGN scheduling and exhausting coverage, this single elimination of quite relevant teams has already been narrowed down from 8 to the final 2. As we stated already on Twitter, we're a little bit disappointed to see this Grand Final decided in a Bo3, and we would've happily swapped the Talent Showmatch for a full fledged Bo5, and honestly it would've been easily achieved based on the extra time gained courtesy of all these matches ending with decisive 2-0 scores (in the past days as well). Anyway we'll still experience a nice Final so not much to complain, talking about the match it self, we're not so surprised to see TSM hitting the Grand Final. The Danes' extremely high form was fully clear from the very beginning, and even if they started their Semi-Final against Gamers2 a bit slow and not quite as focused. They've quickly recovered and unloaded their all their firepower, stormed the misfortunate G2 with convincingly heavy scores (16-7 &amp; 16-6). On the other hand Natus Vincere put their brains to good use, and yet again they managed to overtake an opponent featuring quite high firepower by using smart calls and taking advantage of the tactical weaknesses of Liquid. This became quite clear on de_dust2, where they managed to impressively comeback, however we also need to note that Hiko and friend made a couple of critical mistakes in the money management, and they went for a couple of force-buy that they could have avoided. But well, this is a common (bad) habit for many NA top teams, so we're not too surprised. Overall TSM are obviously advantaged, and without a doubt more solid on the extended map-pool compared to NaVi, and at our end we're expecting to watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train as maps. Should the veto go so, TSM should be advantaged on Overpass, while both Dust2 and Train can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of TSM, and as stated above we're not surprised and do agree on this trend, so even if percentages aren't really amazing we're oriented in picking a Low+ bet on Dupreeh and friends.

Penta in the short-term improved a bit, but honestly they are still floating at kind of low level compared to the full potential of this roster, and looks like they are missing a real leader that can put some order in their gameplay. As plus they didn't play too much in the past month, and their form isn't extremely high. On the other hand, E-Frag are without a doubt more glued than Penta, but still widely inconsistent, in particular on the extended map-pool. Additionally we need to remember that their performance in the GameAgents Grand Final as one of the worst bits of CS we've watched in the past weeks. And here they basically failed on the whole line, despite the Bo5 format was surely forgiving for underdogs (a plain 3-0 with scores like 16-9/16-4/16-11 is quite heavy). Talking about the current game, there are good chances to watch de_dust2, de_cache and de_inferno as maps. If the veto will go so, EFrag should be advantaged on Inferno and slightly on Dust2, while Cache is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on EFrag, so we're oriented in taking this path, with the hope to watch the Bulgarians a bit more focused than during their game against FSid3.
http://csgo.guru/match/2993!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7003!$VP!$Legacy!$VP!$0.7!$0.94!$-0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Opening match of DHW for what should be an entertaining finish to FaceIt Season 3.Theres really not much to say about this game since there is no International data regarding Legacy yet, and even if we watched a lil of them during the FaceIt AU Qualifier (where they did quite fine, and have been a bit lucky too, due to the 4-way Tie). But this isn't enough in order appropriate assess their strengths and weaknesses to give them proper placement. Overall we don't believe Virtus.pro will face any huge issue in rolling over Legacy. The Poles should be fairly better on the whole map-pool, so the Bo1 format won't be an issue either. Anyway, Betting Odds are surprisingly decent for going with VP, mostly due to the Aussies being quite the question mark. Additionally, Snax and friends are kinda used in slumping a bit during the entry match of lan events, but honestly we don't think we'll watch anything surprising. So our pick is an Avg bet on VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/2994!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6991!$Dignitas!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.06!$0.34!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Honestly not too much to say regarding this StarSeries contest. On paper, its an interesting match-up, but historically Dignitas always faced pretty serious issues when dealing with Tier 1 teams such as Fnatic. In particular during games featuring an extended map-pool. However, we should remember that the FaceIT Finals will kick-off in just 2 days, and the Swedes are going to be one of the main contenders of the event, so we don't believe they'll reveal too much of their strats in this game. They'll mostly use it for some last-minute testing and tuning, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a final score slightly closer than expected. On the other hand, Dignitas didn't play too much over the short-term, and the updated roster featuring RUBINO and K0nfig is still far from being on-point. Even if Fnatic won't show their very best, we still doubt we'll watch the Danes going further than taking just a single map. About the veto session, in our opinion we'll watch : de_inferno, de_cbble and de_mirage. If these will be the maps, Fnatic should be capable of grabbing both Inferno and Mirage, while Cobblestone is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Flusha and friends, and we mostly agree on this, so even if percentages aren't really amazing or super rewarding, we're oriented in picking a Low+/Avg- bet on Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/2995!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7004!$Liquid!$TSM!$TSM!$0.45!$0.2!$0.25!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Things are getting more intense now with this one. Here we're already getting into one of the most crucial matches of the day. Liquid are moving here after not too bad of a show @ IEM San Jose, where they managed to beat VP by measure, but then failed to take down NaVi. Despite them playing on a set of maps where they could have kept the scores a bit closer than they went. On the other hand, TSM failed against Guardian and friends as well, during the IEM Grand Final, but despite that choke, we cannot deny that they are remain one of the most solid teams out there. And one of the few fully capable if taking home the FaceIT trophy. However we need to remember that currently they are facing some nasty and potentally counter-productive management issues. And currently their future is a bit unclear since there are rumors about TSM (as org) stepping back from CS as whole. So obviously the Danes may suffer a bit as the result of this situation. Guessing the veto between two teams that never faced each other before is basically impossible, but we wouldn't be surprised to watch them battling on de_overpass, since both the lineups looked quite comfortable on it. If this is the case, TSM should sport a slight advantage. Betting odds are still floating around decent values, so at our end we're oriented in going Low+ on TSM rather than trying our luck with Hiko and the gang, but this is quite a random yet interesting matchup.
http://csgo.guru/match/2996!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7005!$EnVyUs!$NiP!$NiP!$0.5!$0.64!$-0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Best match of the day, and surely one that is always a great fun to watch. Lately NiP hasn't played too much, and in the past week they took a short break. So we don't know if they'll actually in form right way, or if they'll jump in with a couple of aces in the hole. Overall they're quite an unpredictable team, and last time @ Cluj, they followed a similar routine prior to the event, before managing to reach the Semi-Finals. So we don't really suggest to call them out too quickly. Even if their form is nowhere near tp what they were sporting a year ago, they are still one of the most dangerous top-teams around. On the other hand EnvyUs are moving here after a couple of shaky weeks, where they offered quite an extended series of mixed results. And overall, they kinda played inconsistently, even against pretty low-tier opponents. Anyway, just like NiP, we don't suggest underestimating them, because the Frenchmen still won a Major less than a month ago, and even if they didn't seem to care too much over the past few online matches, we are all aware that they'll show up again on at the FaceIT Finals. Again, since we're talking about a Bo1, there aren't many instances to reference to guess the map, but overall we wouldn't be surprised to enjoy quite a close game. On our end, we're oriented towards considering the real-world percentages to be basically aligned around 50/50. So, since the betting odds are mostly trending in favor of Envy, we don't see any reason not to attempt a Low bet on NiP. With the hope of watching F0rest and friends play with a bit less pressure than usual.
http://csgo.guru/match/2997!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7006!$LG!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.45!$0.18!$0.27!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Now this is surely a tricky game, and actually we're not sure about what we should expect to watch. Luminosity just switched Steel &amp; Boltz with Taco &amp; Fnx, and this is a pretty significant change, even if both players coming from Games Academy are fully aware of most strats in use at Luminosity, as their GA playstyles never really differed too much from that of LG. But we're still talking about 'different' players, and in a Lan environment such as Dreamhack Winter, with a lot of pressure, previous experience surely plays a role in keeping personal performances aligned with those from online. Fnatic are in a similar situation, since they had recent roster change, switching Pronax with Dennis. However this actually happened a couple of weeks prior to DHW, so we're oriented in believing that Dennis is already fully integrated amongst the Swedes, and then we don't really expect any real let down from Flusha and friends. About the map, we wouldn't be surprised to watch de_cbble or de_inferno, and in both cases, Fnatic should have an edge. So with Betting odds still quite decent for going with pick on the Swedish side, we're oriented in picking a Low+ bet on them, particularly since LG are surely a bit random and mostly a question mark due to the different lineup
http://csgo.guru/match/3000!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7022!$SKDC!$WinterFox!$WinterFox!$0.5!$0.36!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$As we get ready for DreamHack Winter, we do have one match of note on the schedule for tonight. Kind of an interesting low-end matchup for a best of three StarSeries contest. SKDC certainly isn't one the more relevant low teired teams, but gained some exposure during the RGN Pro Series. But more importantly they gained some much needed experience battling some of the more established and notable teams of the scene. However they didn't perform too well in their recent relevant matches, and are surely a good ways off from competing with the upper T3+ teams, but considering some of the recent bumps we've seen from their NA opponents here, we could see this game go to third map. The recent bumps of Winterfox just mentioned, were largely evident during their brief appearance at RGN. Granted, it was one of the very first events for the currently composed Wfx roster, but honestly we expected a little bit more from them than what they brought. Especially after a respectable entry game victory over Torqued. But since that win, Wfx's struggles have been on full display, even in their last online match vs 3sUP. So this should make for a good opponent for them to try and rebuild some confidence. Since these two teams, as currently composed, have no real match history to reference the veto will likely be driven by whichever maps both teams played well together in practice. So theres no basis to guess the final selection. Ordinarily we'd expect Wfx to be able to grab by a possible 2-0 sweep, but their recent troubles will likely see them lose at least one map, and even a chance to blow the contest all together, putting real-world odds at a 50/50 toss-up. But on our end, we believe the raw team skill of Wfx should be able to prevail, so our pick is a Low bet on them.

TSM looked really impressive so far, and their show on de_overpass against Liquid was simply mind blowing. Not just because of the 16-0 final score, but also because they achieved it as T, something not really easy to do on anv heavily CT-sided map such as Ovp. On the other hand, Virtus.pro didn't sweat too much against the Aussies, and even if Legacy surely put up a better fight than Liquid, we don't think that VP used any of their aces in the hole. So we believe we'll watch the Poles step up a lot in this game, in order to attempt and qualify without the need of additional matches. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of TSM and this is accurate since the Danes are looking really in form at the moment. But surely percentages shouldn't be so skewed. Anyway, lately VP have been quite unreliable, so we're oriented in playing it safe and going for a Low+ bet on TSM (but we wouldn't be surprised to watch close scores).
http://csgo.guru/match/3022!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7041!$Legacy!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.35!$0.13!$0.21999999999999997!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$We begin day 2 of the FACEIT Finals at DHW with the Group A Elimination match. The Oceanic scene is being represented by the less familiar Legacy, as they try to survive another round. They naturally entered the event with limited data to reference, which might have helped them manage some decent pushback to VP's approach in their 12-16 defeat against the Poles. Liquid on the other hand, offered nothing encouraging in the entry game versus TSM, who rolled over the Americans without breaking a sweat. Despite our expectations of the TSM victory, this outcome was quite surprising, as we surely expected more from Liquid who are generally decent on Lan. But as far as this match goes, we'll certainly expect Hiko and friends to bounce back. Especially since the elmination game features the extended map-pool, which will only add to the edge they already have entering the game. Again, since we're talking about a game between two teams without history, theres no way to predict how the veto will go. But Liquid is surely better throughout the maps, so the selection shouldn't be too relevant. Betting odds are of course well skewed in favor of team Liquid, despite their absent entry performance. We don't feel that game bears any significance here, so we agree with the trend. Since they are a bit of a mystery, we wouldn't be surprised if the Aussies can manage to grab one map to force the third deciding map, but we're confident Liquid won't lose two of them. So as long as the percentages don't edge the 90/10 mark (in which case, we suggest a skip), our pick is an Average bet on the North Americans.

NiP are moving here after quite a convincing &amp; somewhat surprising performance against EnvyUs. Something we weren't entirely expecting on a map such as de_mirage, where in the past the Swedes have showed many limits, however it looks like the week off worked to their advantage. The whole team looks quite relaxed at this point. On the other hand, Fnatic had an easy walk over the Brazilians. The 16-0 score on de_dust2 (not even one of the best Fnatic maps) is pretty clear and doesn't require any further analysis or complex explanation. Without a doubt Luminosity are now regretting their last-minute roster changes. Overall we're talking about a pretty balanced game since both teams are looking in form. About the map, we'll very likely watch de_train or de_dust2 (again), and in both cases we'll probably watch a really risky match-up since both the previous contests on these maps went in favor of NiP. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, so at our end we're oriented in going Low on Fnatic. Mostly because we believe they're a bit more reliable in case we watch a weird map.
http://csgo.guru/match/3024!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7045!$EnVyUs!$LG!$LG!$0.6!$0.95!$-0.35!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Heres somewhat of an unexpected matchup, but one we decided to pick from yesterday. NiP did manage put together a very strong entry game versus the favored Frenchmen, to force them into today's second elimination contest. EnVyUs weren't prepared to play to form at the level the Swedes were. The effort lead by KennyS just wasn't enough to take more than 8 rounds. And now they have 3 maps to battle with the struggling Brazilians, to reserve their place in the decider match, where many expected them to be regardless. Luminosity haven't been the threat they were since their run leading up to Cluj. And after a couple of disappointing lan events, the Brazilians acknowledged their issues, and made some lineups changes just before this event. And now at DreamHack Winter, they yet again find themselves in another do or die situation. Both teams out the NA scene fell to their EU opposition 16-0. Although we're optimistic LG will eventually turn things around, we don't anticipate the French being the first to fall in that pattern. Since this is the Group B elimination match, it will feature the extended map-pool for a Bo3. We feel the veto will result with de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_inferno. Should the veto go this way, we highly doubt we'll watch LG taking more than a map, but there is a high probability to watch a plain 2-0 in favor of KennyS and friends, since we're talking about a bunch of maps where the French side are usually really on-point. Betting odds are obviously skewed in favor of EnvyUs, and we agree on this trend since we believe they're a step ahead compared with the renewed Luminosity roster. Our pick is a Low+/Avg- bet on the Frenchmen too.

Liquid are moving here already well warmed up thanks to their victory over Legacy achieved in the morning. Overall, quite an enjoyable elimination match to watch and we can also say that the North American side had to sweat a bit in order to tame the Aussies. On the other hand Virtus.pro had to deal with a quite shaky Day1, and after the entry victory over Legacy, they had hard times against TSM, despite they were playing on a map (de_mirage) where usually they always been really consistent. However, the Danes aren't an easy opponent to deal with, particularly on LAN, so the 13-16 final score still shows some progresses for VP that lately are slumping a bit. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch : de_overpass, de_mirage and de_cache. If the veto will go so, Mirage should be in favor of VP, while both Cache and Overpass are mostly 50/50. Betting odds are currently still acceptable for going Low+/Avg- on [Pasha] and friends, so we're oriented in taking this path, even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch this game hitting map3.

To clarify, we're drawing a similarity to what Titan used to do. Honestly with 2/5 of the lineup composed of new players, the LG playstyle and veto changed a bit. And overall they are a bit unpredictable, since most of the teams aren't used to countering their new stuff. This also means theres no middle ground with them. They either winged it with amazing results, or they lost terribly. And to be honest, this isn't a good thing, in particular against teams like NiP who are widely focused in managing that "grey zone" well. Anyway, at our end, we're a bit more prone to considering the Swedes more reliable, mostly because the Bo3 format. But on-paper they should also have a decent map advantage, in particular on de_cbble and de_train. Betting odds are still decent for going with NiP, but after what we watched against Envy, we don't suggest go with values above Low. And you should keep a close eye on percentages as well, in order to skip if odds will hit nonsense values such as 85/15 or so.

So we're pretty sure they'll not drop out without fighting for every round till the very end. Overall Fnatic looked a bit more convincing so far. They somehow managed to roll over Luminosity with a stunning 16-0 score, while all the others top-teams fell victim to the shots from the Brazilian side. Additionally, they proved their exceptionally stong form against NiP as well, even on a map thats always been a bit tricky for them. On the other hand, Virtus.Pro provided a set of kinda mixed feelings. They started well against Legacy, but then they dropped on Mirage versus TSM, so they had to deal with Liquid in order to reach the Semis. Honestly we can't say that it was a game on par with the other decider, so we don't suggest to take the complete progression as extremely relevant. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_train, de_dust2 and de_cbble. If the veto goes this way, Train and Dust2 are mostly even, while Cobblestone should be in favor of Fnatic. Betting odds aren't too exceptional right now, but overall we believe that Flusha and friends are fairly advantaged, so we're oriented in going Low+ on them, rather than hoping for one of the VP's explosive peaks.

TSM were unquestionably amongst the top four to arrive on day 3, particularly when evaluating their form over the last few weeks. Which is quite impressive considering the management and organizational distractions. The Danes had rolled their way to the IEM Finals, but were upset by NaVi. And just a few days later they're here in Sweden rolling along once more. After IEM they evidently had some steam to blow off, as they shut out Liquid in the entry game 16-0. In the winner's game, the Danish side didn't have as easy a fight as they edged out VP to claim their spot here in the semis. Luminosity on the other hand, have been an extremely interesting team to follow. Their move to NA scene has been a bumpy one, but with shimmers of some brilliance and promise. As we mentioned for their previous matches, LG switched up the roster before this event, and there's no arguing that these changes are currently paying dividends. The Brazilians have had an incredible journey here since being shutout in the entry game by Fnatic, having had to eliminate some of EU's elite. LG responded to their 0-16 stinker, by eliminating EnVyUs and NiP in consecutive Bo3s. And now they must repeat that underdog performance for a third time in order to reach the Grand-Final. As for this matchup, the history between the two is mostly non-existent, but on paper the Danes are surely favored sporting superior firepower, and a very solid teamplay, especially on Lan. But LG has played very smart and patiently to survive this far. They managed to gain early leads with strong first halves, forcing their opponents to play catchup. As for the veto, we're expecting to see de_dust2, de_inferno, and de_overpasss. TSM probably has an edge throughout the map-pool, but assuming this is the selection, LG's best chances for another upset, will be in grabbing wins on Inferno and Overpass. They usually play these maps solid against both NA and EU teams. And even in the matches they lost, they put up respectable numbers. But as we learned yesterday, they're not to be underestimated. Betting Odds are still expectedly in favor of the Danes, despite the wins that lands the Brazilians here, however they're not too heavily skewed. Percentages are rewarding enough for a TSM pick, but everyone loves a 'Cinderella Story', and we're tempted to take the gamble. But TSM hasn't been as prone to random fails (like NV and NiP have been), so our pick is Low bet on the consistency of Dupreeh and friends.

Nobody was really expecting such a show by Luminosity and what they managed to put up is simply amazing and outstanding. Accomplishing what they did against these Top tier teams is just unbelievable. And even if they are joining the Grand Final as underdogs, we're all now fully aware of their potential. And in our hearts, we would be extremely happy to watch a 'cindarella story' such as this one come to fruition. On the other hand, Fnatic know how to deal with the Grand-Finals stage. They are surely way more experienced than LG, and they are striving to show that they are still the team to beat. Additionally, winning in front of their own audience is obviously something they really want to achieve. About maps, we believe we'll watch de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train. If the veto will go so, Fnatic should have an edge on Train, while both Dust2 and Inferno are going to be 50/50, based on what Luminosity displayed so far. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on JW and friends, and at our end we're oriented in taking this way. But honestly, at this point, anything can happen.

Overall there are good chances to watch this game ending with a plain 2-0 in favor of Dupreeh and the gang, TSM despite the issues they had against Luminosity during the FACEIT Finals are still an extremely consistent team, and we highly doubt we'll watch them losing a Bo3 where they are basically advantaged on every single map, however we wouldn't be surprised to watch them 'overlooking' a bit the entry one, but in the worst case they should be able to close the game 2-1. About maps, we'll likely watch de_mirage, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, TSM will likely grab Mirage and train, while Overpass could be a bit closer than expected, in particular if played as first. Betting odds are already pretty skewed and not really rewarding, so we suggest to keep a close eye on them and eventually just skip if the percentages hit values around 90/10. If you want to bet anyway, our pick is obviously TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/3082!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7079!$Dignitas!$G2!$G2!$0.4!$0.21!$0.19000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Honestly not the most relavent Bo3 out there since both Dignitas and Gamers2 are fielding a stand-in per side. The Danes are playing with Zonic instead of Tenzki, while G2 are using MUTiRiS due Rain being unavailable. Overall we're not expecting any huge surprise, Maikelele and friends should be still decently advantaged despite the stand-in, and we doubt we'll watch them losing more than a map, anyway we need to note that both teams didn't really play too much in the short-term, and they took several days off during the past weeks, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch these rosters setting up a show slightly below their average. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_inferno, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto will go so, G2 should be advantaged on Inferno and slightly on Train, while Mirage should be kinda 50/50. Betting odds are currently in favor of G2, and we agree on this trend, so since the percentages turned a bit better due stand-ins we're oriented in picking a Low+ bet on Gamers2.
http://csgo.guru/match/3090!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7086!$CLG!$coL!$CLG!$0.6!$0.61!$-0.010000000000000009!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$The only game on our NA schedule for this evening. A matchup we've seen many times before, but not the most interesting of matches considering the rut both teams are currently in. CLG has been struggling with inconsistency over the last few months, and looked to have started to turn things around towards the end of CEVO S8, but have since managed a run of disappointing events (especially their Lan ones), where they found themselves eliminated earlier than expected. They have the potential, but their veto choices haven't always put them in the best position for victory, so theres reason for hesitation on CLG picks. CompLexity on the other hand, have also had their series of ups and downs. They looked to start November with a series of wins, and their form appeared encouraging, including a wins over CLG and C9. However, that spark was short lived, and they too suffered a rather steep decline in performances as the month progressed. Now they too look to start the new month a high note. But we should also mention, Valens departed from the team, and coL will be using Warden as standin this evening. So we're not expecting too much from them till they can solidify the roster. Since this is an RGN Freedom Cup contest, the usual bo3 will apply. Though the coL lineup change 'may' affect their map selection, we're anticipating seeing de_train, de_cbble, and de_cache for the maps. Should the veto go this way, CLG should be able to grab Cobblestone, while coL should take Cache if it goes to the third map. While Train is typically a 50/50 map, the coL roster change, we feel, gives the edge slightly towards CLG. Betting Odds are trending in favor of CLG, which we're inclined to agree. Historically, coL has performed better than CLG in their head to head games, but we think the absence of Valens will negatively impact this pattern. And so our pick in Low+ Bet on CLG.

Dignitas are moving here after a couple of Bo3s where they performed kinda badly, but we should note that they were using Zonic instead of Tenzki, while today they'll field their usual roster, so this should help a bit. On the other hand Natus Vincere are still on their great winning streak, but they didn't really play after IEM San Jose and they're rolling into this match after about a week of break, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them a bit rusty. As plus we should remember than NaVi always had the issue of overlooking online matches, even if we believe that this won't be the case since we're talking about the GO:CL Semi-Final. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_inferno, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will go so NaVi should be able to take home both Mirage and Inferno, while we wouldn't be surprised to see Dignitas offering a good fight on Overpass. Betting odds are still decent for going with a Low+/Avg- bet on GuardiaN and friends, so we're oriented in taking this path as well, even if we really suggest to avoid the 'full-yolo mode' (== stay low in values) due the NaVi unpredictability.
http://csgo.guru/match/3093!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7100!$TSM!$E-Frag!$TSM!$0.68!$0.88!$-0.19999999999999996!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not a bad match to watch, but honestly the chances of watching E-Frag winning, and thus qualifying for the Red Dot LAN aren't really exceptionally high. TSM are one of the 'worst' teams that a T2 team can face, since they are so extremely methodical and well balanced. And if you're not capable of fielding enough firepower to break their 'slow' gameplay, the whole match is like bouncing off a rubber-wall. Overall we don't believe we'll watch the Bulgarians take down the Danes. And this game may even end with a plain 2-0 score too. Especially if Dupreeh and friends are able to handle the veto properly. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train. If this is the case, TSM should be advantaged on all of them. However, if Inferno gets played first, (and TSM are stepping in a bit 'cold') we wouldn't be surprised to watch E-Frag give them a decent challenge. Betting odds aren't really good or extremely rewarding, but after-all, TSM should be able to take this home and qualify for the Red Dot finals. So we suggest keeping a close eye on the percentages and eventually skip if the values turn into 90/10. If not, feel free to go Avg on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/3094!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7094!$SK!$G2!$SK!$0.4!$0.17!$0.23!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Surely SK managed to setup sever really promising performances during the past few weeks, and they without doubts improved a lot compared to the shaky form they showed for months. However, the Bo3 format isn't really in their favor, and against a team such as Gamers2 (currently sporting a grace moment) they don't really have many chances, and we highly doubt we'll watch them taking more than a map. About the veto, we'll likely watch : de_mirage, de_overpass and de_cache. If it will go so, SK may have some chances on Overpass but Mirage and Cache should be in favor of Gamers2. Betting odds are still barely profitable for an Average bet on G2, but honestly this is the way to go since we don't believe we'll watch Maikelele and friends suffering too much.

TSM are stepping into this game after a couple of not so exciting performances against Dignitas and EFrag. Yes the Danes managed to win both these games, but honestly they were way closer than expected, and Dupreeh and friends had to sweat more than usual in order to take home a victory. This ringed more than a bell at our end, and actually looks like that TSM are relaxing a bit too much. And surely the issues they previously experienced against Luminosity (@ DHW) and G2 (@ IEM) aren't encouraging matches to referrence. On the other hand, yesterday Gamers2 fell against the shots of SK, which was honestly pretty unexpected. But after-all, we should remember that they're playing with a stand-in (MUTiRiS) and this could be an issue when dealing with lineups hungry for victories such as SK. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on TSM, and even if the current percentages aren't really amazing we don't really feel comfprtable gambling again on the G2 stand-ins, so we'll play safe and stick with TSM, even if we aren't really happy about their recent performances.
http://csgo.guru/match/3116!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7132!$Vexed!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.4!$0.09!$0.31000000000000005!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Not an easy match as may look at first sight. Vexed are actually pretty famous for ALWAYS setting up their AAA game against top-tier opponents, despite frequently playing in a kinda shaky way against low-tier teams. We don't really suggest to underestimate the Poles, they already took part in two Majors and messed consistently with a lot of top-teams. Even if surely the Bo3 format is not going to help them too much, and after a start with the pedal to the metal they'll very likely cool down a bit as the match progresses. On the other hand, EnvyUs aren't currently sporting their best form. They had serious issues during DreamHack Winter, and their level looked way below the T1 average. But honestly this should be quite a manageable match for the Frenchmen, and after the DHW fail they cannot really afford to miss the qualification to Red Dot finals. So even if they might lose a map in the process they should be able to take home a victory. Betting odds are dropping quickly, and currently percentages are barely profitable, so even if our pick is EnvyUs, we highly suggest to keep a close eye on values before going with them, and eventually just SKIP if they'll move to 85/15 or so.
http://csgo.guru/match/3117!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7123!$Na'Vi!$Titan!$Na'Vi!$0.58!$0.6!$-0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Most relevant match of the evening, and quite an interesting one too since usually Natus Vincere care a lot about SLTV. Titan in the past weeks took a pretty long break, and we can easily say that they didn't play at all during the past two weeks, plus the shows they managed to setup prior the break were all quite disappointing. So we doubt we'll watch the French/Belgian side sporting a super-high form, in particular since Natus Vincere improved a lot in the past months and also achieved really relevant results. Well, surely we cannot say that NaVi played well yesterday against Dignitas, but after-all, they always had the issue of underestimating T2 opponents, so this isn't something really new. And the history of this roster is full of this kind of results, so we don't suggest to base your thoughts on that single match, but instead on what they showed so far. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_cbble, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, NaVi should be advantaged on Train, while both Overpass and Cobblestone can easily go both ways. Betting odds aren't too bad and still decent for sticking with GuardiaN and friends, so we're oriented in going Low+ on them, with the hope to watch NaVi slightly more focused than yesterday.

Obviously we don't have real stats &amp; data yet, but surely a lineup featuring Dosia, Mou, Adren &amp; Hooch shouldn't be underestimated, and actually we wouldn't be surprised to watch them playing on par with FlipSid3. Overall HSGG should sport slightly higher fire-power compared to F3, but strats-wise, we don't believe they are ready to mess with a consolidated team yet. And on a Bo3, will be hard for them keeping their performances consistent over the 2/3 maps, but after-all, this is basically a local CIS match, so many doors are opened and the outcome isn't really written in stone. Betting odds are quite skewed in favor of Markeloff &amp; friends, and this is understandable, but honestly we believe that real-world percentages are way closer than that, and usually intra-CIS games are used to following slightly different dynamics, since most of the players are fully aware of how their former mates play. At our end we don't find fine risking an Avg bet on Fsid3 too safe, so we're slightly more oriented in attempting an ICB/Low-- bet on HSGG. Surely a quite risky pick too, but after-all we're talking about a match that may reserve surprises.
http://csgo.guru/match/3122!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7139!$Na'Vi!$EnVyUs!$Na'Vi!$0.5!$0.41!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The most interesting match-up we'll enjoy today, and much likely a quite balanced one since EnvyUs lately dropped the ball a bit, while Natus Vincere woke up and started providing consistent performances again. On paper this is a pure 50/50 game, both teams should be kinda aligned and the Fenchmen always had some issues in dealing with GuardiaN and friends and overall they never really managed to understand the (messy) NaVi mid-game, that honestly doesn't really follow any real pattern but most of times is simply improvised and a bit momentum based. About maps, according to out Veto graph, there are good chances to watch : de_dust2, de_train and de_mirage. Both teams always followed a quite similar set of maps so we expect kinda even performances on all of them, with the only exception of Mirage that is generally a good map for NaVi but in this case we need to note that they rarely managed to play it properly against EnvyUs. Betting odds are skewed in favor of the French side, mostly because the previous H2Hs, but real-world percentages are right in the middle, so we don't see any reason for not attempting a Low bet on NaVi in order to take advantage of the more rewarding values.
http://csgo.guru/match/3123!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7145!$LC!$HR!$LC!$0.4!$0.17!$0.23!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another 'Challenger' match, this time we're collecting data about London Conspiracy, overall one of the best candidates for a T3 spot in our World Ranking since they actually feature a quite solid lineup (the trio composed by Mystic + Slap + Polly is pretty interesting) and yesterday they managed to take down Epsilon in a really easy fashion. However, messing with HellRaisers is a whole different story, and surely the Bo3 format isn't going to help too much as well. Additionally we need to note that HR woke up a bit in the short-term and they are looking revitalized, our only concern is that they don't have an 'official' 5th yet, even if Schneider is actually filling this spot since a quite long time. Betting odds are still quite decent for going Low+ on HR, so we suggest to play safe and stick with them.

As we stated yesterday as well, Titan are just back from a quite long break, and their results right after their comeback aren't no-where encouraging, however we need to remember that local matches always follow different patterns compared to International ones, and since most of the players involved in this game used to play (mixed) together for a pretty long time, offering a consistent strats-countering is always easier (due the known habits). This is basically the same concept we observed yesterday in HS.GG vs Fsid3, the only difference is the French sauce. Surely EnvyUs are generally a bit advantaged, due the slightly better teamplay and a wider map-pool dominance, but overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch this game hitting the third map. About veto, there are good chances to watch : de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_train. If it goes so, Cobblestone should be in favor of Envy, while Dust2 and Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are overly skewed in favor of Envy, while in reality we're talking about a match that could be closer than expected, so even if Happy and friends are surely advantaged we're a bit more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Titan, with the hope to watch Scream and the gang setting up something better than yesterday.

Honestly we don't believe we'll watch Fnatic trying too hard and they might use this game for testing out stuff as well, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them offering a show slightly below their average. On the other hand Gamers2 are still fielding MUTiRiS instead of Rain, and while this didn't stop them from taking down TSM yesterday, we don't really believe that will work amazingly against Flusha and friends, that are currently sporting an higher form compared to the Danes. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train. If the veto will go so, Fnatic should be able to take Inferno, while both Dust2 and Train are going to be kinda 50/50. Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of the Swedes, and this doesn't make any sense since we're talking about a not-so-relevant match, so at our end we're oriented in taking advantage of the percentages by going for an ICB/Low- bet on G2, with the hope to watch them offering a good show as they did against TSM.

Honestly we don't have much to say about it, and generally LDLDw always struggled against top-tier opponents, so we don't really believe we'll watch them taking down Mousesports in a game featuring the Bo2 format. Our pick is Mouz and in the worst case we should watch just a Tie. However, Betting Odds aren't anything exceptional, so feel free to consider a plain skip too.

CSGL took a quite long break from T1-3 matches (lately they mostly played irrelevant games), and in-between they also switched Loord with Mouz, so overall we're talking about a team that after a constant lack of results during the past couple of Quarters, is trying to change their face a bit in order to re-gain a form similar to the one they had in early 2015. Actually we've some serious doubts about CSGL, and even if Mouz isn't facing their brightest moment we don't believe we'll watch the Germans losing two maps in a row, in particular because the Poles always had serious issues in messing with the extended map-pool, and with the exclusion of de_mirage they never really provided consistent performances in Bo2/3 matches. Betting odds are still quite decent for going with Mousesports so our pick is an Average bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/3132!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7166!$Conquest!$NME!$Conquest!$0.58!$0.76!$-0.18000000000000005!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The only match on our NA schedule tonight, the StarSeries XIV Upper Bracket Quarter Finals, featuring two mid-teired teams who've shown promise over the last few months. Conquest, as we've mentioned on a number of occasions are one of the more exciting NA teams to watch, with their distinctive aggressive playstyle, and have always come through with some entertaining shows. The past two quarters has offered continuous signs of progress, including their impressive run to the CEVO S8 Finals, where they really established themselves as a credible NA threat. However, their quick exit from the IBP Cup (single elimination bracket) greatly slowed their momentum and lowered expectations. As for the StarSeries though, the Canadians have faired well in the Bo3 format, locking in their position undefeated at the top of NA Group B. On the other hand Enemy has shown some encouraging things, but overall haven't progressed as well as the Canadians. They've had a little time off since we've last seen them, but this might not be the match they need to get back on track. Relyks and friends rely heavily on teamplay since they don't sport the firepower some of the higher tiered NA teams do. But this hasn't been enough to edge out any wins in the past versus Conquest, and honestly we're not expecting this pattern to deviate today either, particularly on the extended map-pool. For those maps, we expect to see de_inferno, de_mirage, and de_overpass. But generally Conquest should be advantaged on all three, so we wouldn't be surprised to see ShahZaM and co. grab this in a 2-0 sweep. But even if NME can manage to grab one map, we don't believe Conquest will fall short on any more than that. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on Conquest, so we're oriented in going this way, even if we suggest keeping an eye on percentages, in case they move below the profitability threshold.
http://csgo.guru/match/3137!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7163!$NiP!$SK!$NiP!$0.6!$0.76!$-0.16000000000000003!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$First match of the FB Masters Finals, and honestly a quite interesting one since having SK in a final stage of a league that featured several big names is a bit surprisingly. But well, we cannot deny that Cadian and friends managed to setup a quite amazing set of performances during the last month, and actually they are one of the teams that improved the most in the short-term, so even if we're not sure if they'll be able to keep this trend in the future, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing decently in this game, so we don't suggest to underestimate them too much. On the other hand NiP took a week off right after Dreamhack Winter, but overall they didn't disappoint us too much at the Swedish event, and we don't suggest to take their loss against Luminosity as extremely relevant since the Brazilians turned into a really tricky opponent for most of the T1 teams attending the event. Overall F0rest and co. surely sport a way higher experience compared to SK, and even if they could overlook a map, we don't believe we'll watch the Swedes losing the whole Bo3. About maps, we're expecting to watch: de_inferno, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto will go so, NiP should be fairly advantaged on Inferno, while both Mirage and Train could be slightly closer than expected. Betting odds are still decent for going with a Low+ bet on NiP, so we're oriented in playing safe and stick with them.
http://csgo.guru/match/3138!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7167!$E-Frag!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.4!$0.23!$0.17!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$Well, we can't say that EnvyUs are facing their brightest moment, in the short term the Frenchmen provided a quite long series of shaky results, and even on Lan (where they used to be consistent) they failed to impress. Yesterday against Titan they displayed a good amount of critical flaws, and even if local derbies are always a bit more tricky than International matches, we need to note that overall their executions looked really slow and kinda out-of-sync compared to their usual average. However the Bo3 format is still in favor of Happy and friends, and even if E-Frag aren't an easy team to face due their really fast-paced gameplay, we have to remember that on the extended map-pool the French side should be still fairly advantaged. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train. If the veto will go so, Envy should be able to grab Dust2, while Efrag could take one of the two, even if we don't believe they'll be capable to take both. Betting odds are rolling in favor of EnvyUs, and this is expected, but after-all the current percentages aren't too bad and still pretty suitable for going Low+ on the Frenchmen, so at our end we're oriented in keep walking on the tracked path too.

If you missed the drama, yesterday the Danes officially left TSM, and temporary re-branded themselves into "?", but later today they should unveil their new Org, so at our end we waited a bit before renaming them within our DB, mostly in order to avoid misunderstandings. However, talking about the match it self, the former TSM squad showed some stutters in the past few days, and even if overall they are still doing pretty fine, we're oriented in believing that their 'uncertain' team situation put a bit of unneeded extra pressure over their heads. On the other hand Fnatic are back on top, and after winning the FACEIT Finals, the Swedes are moving into this game with a convincingly 2-0 vs G2 in their bags, together with a pretty high form and motivation. About maps, according to our Veto Graph, we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_inferno and de_overpass. If it will go so, Fnatic should be advantaged on Inferno, while both Dust2 and Overpass can easily go both ways. Betting odds are skewed in favor of Flusha and friends, mostly due their really convincingly short-term performances, but overall we're mostly talking about a quite even game, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch TSM back on track. As just mentioned, even if believe that Fnatic have a slightly edge, we cannot agree on the current percentages (floating around 70/30), so since we're talking about a T1 Lan match, we're more oriented in trying our luck with a Low- bet on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/3142!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7183!$SK!$TSM!$SK!$0.35!$0.07!$0.27999999999999997!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$We begin today's FBM S5 Finals with an all-Danish Lower Bracket head to head, following the disappointing 0-2 losses that both teams suffered in their respective bracket semi-finals yesterday. As we mentioned plenty of times already, over the past few weeks, SK has improved a lot, but actually they still lack of experience and looks like they still have issues in messing with T1 teams. This kind of issues showed up yesterday in a very disappointing game against NiP, where they fell 16-2 and 16-6. This could be largely attributed to their lack of lan experience, which seemed quite evident through both maps. And to be honest, the Danes just looked confused right from the start, beginning with the veto. Considering their oppponent, SK didn't put themselves in a great position with Cache as the first map. So if they have any hope of turning the tide, they'll need to approach today's contest much wiser than yesterday. Meanwhile, exTSM (the players formerly of TeamSoloMid) may have been burdened by the off-screen drama, on their way to their own decisive defeat at the hands of the other swedes remaining in the finals, Fnatic. The Danes weren't even able to manage reaching the third map as well. However, unlike SK, TSM put up a more respectable fight, at least in the first half of their games. But Fnatic is obviously rolling along strong, and the current form of Dupreeh and co. was simply not enough to hang with the Swedes. Regardless, we do want to commend the Danish group for still grinding ahead in competition despite everything they're currently dealing with. As far as the veto goes, we're expecting to watch de_inferno, de_mirage, and de_overpass. The experience of TSM, particularly in lan events, surely favors them throughout the map-pool compared to SK. If this is how the veto unfolds, SK's best chance to grab a map will likely be Overpass, mainly since their Danish counterparts have struggled there a bit more lately than in the past. But, even though TSM aren't currently performing at their usual level, they should still be able to take the victory over SK. And so we're in agreement with the current Betting Odds that are expectedly skewed well in favor of TSM. Provided the percentages remain rewarding enough for an Average Bet, they're our pick for this contest.
http://csgo.guru/match/3143!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7184!$NiP!$Fnatic!$NiP!$0.45!$0.25!$0.2!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Now we progress to the FBM winners' match, the Upper Bracket Final, an all-Swede derby and quite a Big match. We always get excited for this classic match-up, and after watching their performances yesterday, we have no doubts we can look forward to another exciting show. NiP first had to roll over SK to advance here, and as we mentioned for the previous match, they did so with a very tilted two map sweep of the Danes. History has shown us NiP are always a bit unpredictable, and in their last lan at DHW they were eliminated by the Brazilians who were riding a hot streak, but in an encouraging bounce back contest yesterday, they look to be in promising form entering this bout. Fnatic on the other hand, have quickly retaken their spot at the top, and lately no one has been able to find a chink in their armor. Last weekend at DHW we watched them stroll to the FACEIT Grand Final with an impressive cold blood, where they ended LG's 'cinderella story', and ended the day with the trophy held high. And now as they push to win another event, they enter this match as the obvious favorites, especially after handling TSM as convincing as they did yesterday in another 2 map sweep. As for the maps, based on our veto pattern graph, we'll expect to see this rivalry refueled on de_dust2 and de_train, which neither team will have a distinct advantage, and de_mirage which favors Fnatic. Meanwhile current Betting Odds are already trash, skewed well in favor of fnatic, which based on what they've shown is difficult to hard. But as we said, NiP is quite unpredictable, and have proven before, at their best they are capable of beating any team out there. So with these percentages, the only bet worth making is an ICB on f0rest and the Ninjas, with the hope to watch them setting up a proper game.
http://csgo.guru/match/3147!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7187!$CLG!$3sUP!$CLG!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not the most interesting match out there, nor the most exciting, in particular because FBM Finals are currently catalyzing our (and most of the audience) attention. However, despite CLG are fielding a stand-in (LILMAN instead of Hazed) we don't believe we'll watch them losing their entry game against 3sUP, even if the Bo1 format is always quite random, in particular within the NA scene, and even more random in not-so-relevant LANs such as this one. Surely there are good chances to watch a match closer than expected, and Betting Odds are currently reflecting this as well, but we should keep in mind that even if the 3sUP lineup always looked very promising, in the short-term they didn't shine at all, and they had serious issues against most of the T2 NA teams. Percentages are still decent for going Low on CLG, so we're oriented in taking this path.

[CoL] are rolling into this game from a pretty impressive negative streak, in the past few weeks Semphis and co. faced serious issues, and looked pretty far away from the good form they showed during Q3. Overall this roster has a quite high potential, but currently their teamplay is way too messy and out-of-sync, and this is something that may turn into a serious problem when facing an organized team such as Method, in particular on Lan. Additionally we should remember that Shroud is playing instead of Strebor for this event, and this is surely a big plus for Method, since having one of the top-ranked NA players within their ranks, together with the C9 expertise (C9 trashed coL 16-1 &amp; 16-5 just 2 weeks ago) is something that can help a lot, and even more in a Bo1 match. Betting odds are trending in favor of coL, but honestly this is a pure 50/50 game, and we wouldn't be surprised at all to watch an upset, so our pick is a Low- bet on Method.
http://csgo.guru/match/3149!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7208!$SK!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.4!$0.12!$0.28!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$A bit of an unexpected matchup, but certainly now quite an interesting one. SK surely came to play yesterday, with an outstanding performance over ex-TSM (the players formerly of TeamSoloMid) to survive another day and advance here to the FBM S5 Consolidation Final. As we mentioned for yesterday's match, SK has had a recurrent problem of slow starts, forcing them to play from behind. Versus the fellow Danes, they corrected that pattern, and came out pedal to the metal, and it paid off with a whopping 16-2 titlt. They fell back to habit though with 2 round first half on Train, and just couldn't make up the rounds they lost. And then went toe-to-toe to grab Mirage in a titghtly contested 16-13 finish. So they earned their chance to be here,where the competition won't be an easier. After the Danish gave us great show, we got to enjoy a thrilling rivalry between Swedes. fnatic entered yesterday's game as the heavy favorites, but as we said NiP are prone to brillance and capable of the upset and our Low pick was quite rewarding. But overall, this was the first sub par performance we've seen from the current roster, and believe it was a loss they were due, but now just a minor blip since it was loss with minimal consequence (since they earned a second chance). As for this match, as we just implied, we're not expecting the Swedes to repeat yesterday's fail, and aren't going to lose two out of three maps against SK. With regards to those three maps, we expect to see de_cbble, de_mirage, and de_overpass. Fnatic surely have the advantage across the whole map-pool, but SK's best hope to reach the third map is taking Mirage. Current Betting Odds are of course already quite skewed in favor of the Swedes, which is expected, but after-all we don't believe we'll watch Fnatic going home without hitting the final, so since the current percentages are still around 75/25, we're a bit more oriented in going Avg on them. However, we highly suggest to keep an eye on the values prior placing your bet, and eventually skip if they'll drop to 90/10 or so.
http://csgo.guru/match/3150!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7211!$E-Frag!$Titan!$Titan!$0.4!$0.27!$0.13!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an extremely relevant match, and we're not expecting any real surprise out of it. Surely Titan haven't play a lot in the short-term, and even if they managed to grab a victory over EnvyUs a couple of days ago, we don't suggest to take that result as extremely relevant, since local games always follow a particular pattern. However, on the other hand E-frag aren't the most scary opponent out there. Even if they displayed a decent capability in setting up good fights against high-tiered teams, we don't really believe we'll watch them taking a whole Bo3 against the Frenchmen. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, we wouldn't be surprised to watch EFrag setting up a good show on Overpass, but Shox and friends should have a clear edge on both Dust2 and Inferno. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on the French side, so we're oriented in playing safe and sticking with Titan.
http://csgo.guru/match/3151!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7216!$Na'Vi!$E-Frag!$E-Frag!$0.6!$0.87!$-0.27!$MEDIUM RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for E-Frag, and now the Bulgarians will face Natus Vincere. This game could be potentially closer compared their previous one against Titan, mostly because NaVi always had the problem of underestimating low-tier opponents, which has frequently led to quite unexpected upsets and barely convincing performances. However, we need to note that currently, GuardiaN and co. are sporting a quite high form, and overall they are sitting on the top of a really convincing series of results. So even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch them overlook a map, we doubt they'll lose two. About the Veto session, according to our Graph, we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If these will be the maps, NaVi should be advantaged on basically all of 3, but probably D2 is going to be the one slightly more 'risky' of the trio. Betting odds are still decent for going with NaVi, so once again we're oriented in playing safe, but this time we're more for sticking with a Low value only instead of picking an Avg one, mostly due the 'too-relaxed' playstyle that they frequently setup against mid-tier opponents.
http://csgo.guru/match/3152!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7202!$Imm!$Legacy!$Imm!$0.55!$0.62!$-0.06999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not too much to say about this Tier 3 all-Aussie matchup. Immunity made a splash with an excting show during Crown's Invitational, following their elimination of Cloud9, but fell short of taking the event by a 2-1 loss vs VP. Since then, they haven'y played too many relevant matches, but they're certainly one of the more promising groups out of the Oceanic scene to keep an eye on. Legacy on the other hand, are also an up and coming team from the Australian talent pool. They recently joined the international scene, and following the 4-way tie out of the FaceIt AU qualifier made an appearanace at the DHW FaceIt Finals. Though they didn't land any exceptional results, they did put up a decent fight in their contests versus Liquid and VP. So they too are a welcome addition to an expanding AU CS:GO scene with the potential of doing some exciting things in the furure. For this the Counter Pit bout, the usual bo2 format applies. Without any match data to reference, predicting the veto isn't posible. Current Betting Odds are aligned with our real world odds, giving a slight edge to IMTY. We're inclined to agree with this, basically since we've seen more from them as the more established of the two. So our pick is a Low Bet on IMTY, since we think they should be able to grab at least one of the maps, with a worst case result being a tie.
http://csgo.guru/match/3154!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7220!$CLG!$coL!$CLG!$0.42!$0.64!$-0.22000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Northern Arena Grand-Final, and surely an interesting match, however we need to note that this even has been quite a mess and pretty stressing for most of the teams attending it, since was plagued by delays and a kinda no-sense schedule. Anyway, both teams followed a similar pattern, and played pretty well till now, but after-all they didn't really face super scary opponents or the best of what North America can offer, so having them in the Final isn't an huge surprise. About maps we believe we'll watch: de_cache, de_train and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, Cache should be in slightly favor of compLexity, while CLG should grab Cobblestone, and Train is going to be kinda 50/50. In the past coL frequently managed to take the upper hand over CLG, and overall they always looked pretty fine in countering Tarik and co., however here we're talking about a LAN final, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch CLG inverting the trend due the higher experience. Currently betting odds aren't really exceptional, and percentages are overly skewed in favor of CLG, at our end we agree on this but we don't believe that their edge should be higher than just a 10%, so we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB on coL.
http://csgo.guru/match/3155!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7209!$NiP!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.5!$0.42!$0.08000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$FBM Grand Final, and without a doubt, one of the greatest matches we'll enjoy in December. This is not just a big classic between two lineups that are currently pretty aligned in performances, but also a game that features two teams with a long-standing rivalry, that in the past provided us some of the greatest CS:GO shows ever. So we really suggest to grab some snacks and sit back to watch it. Actually this is a pure 50/50 clash, and the 'veto map advantage' in favor of NiP due to them coming from the upper bracket means nothing, and will not bring any real-world perk to F0rest and friends. Fnatic are a roster fully capable of performing great on the whole extended map-pool, so you cannot just put them to their knees with a veto. However, about maps, we believe we'll watch: de_mirage, de_dust2 and de_train. If the veto will go so, Fnatic should have an edge on Mirage, while NiP may grab Dust2, and Train is going to be a pure 50/50 contest. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Fnatic, but as we already stated above, the real percentages are sitting just in the middle. So we suggest to take advantage of the slightly skewed values by going with a Low pick on NiP.
http://csgo.guru/match/3156!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7229!$TSM!$E-Frag!$TSM!$0.6!$0.71!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We begin today's schedule with the StarSeries EU Last Chance contest, which turned out to be a bit unexpected pair, since E-frag managed to beat Natus Vincere yesterday. Although we did mention NaVi had a bad habit of underestimating lower tiered teams, and to that end, the Bulgarians took full advantage. So they're coming into this one on a bit of high, which could be the necessary ingredient to combat the down-and-out Dane's. ex-TSM have had a hard time getting their game going, resulting in three consecutive losses, all on matches featuring the Bo3 format. Somehing very uncharacteristic of this commonly solid team. Naturally, the assumed sponsor negotiations is sure be of some distration, and over these last three games they haven't been playing to form. After the discouragiing loss to SK yesterday, E-frag is sure to be feeling that more optimistic of their chances. As for this contest, we'll likely see the de_dust2, de_inferno, and de_overpass following the map veto. Generally, the Danish should be advantaged on any of the maps, but ultimately, the best chance for E-frag to advance is get a head start and take Dust. Bettiing Odds are trending in well in favor of Device and friends, while real world odds are less extreme at 60/40. However, currently percentages didn't reach the 'ICB' threshold yet, and we doubt they'll do, so we'll try to stick with a Low bet on exTSM, with the hope to watch something a bit better than what they setup in the past week.
http://csgo.guru/match/3157!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7227!$VP!$HR!$HR!$0.58!$0.71!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$AVG BET!$Here we have the remainig match of the GO:CL S2 Semi-Finals, where the winner will move on to meet Dignitas. Really not too much to say about this match-up, Virtus.Pro were one of the favorites for the finals, so they're expectedly 2 maps away from doing just that. The Poles have kinda been a win/lose alternating streak. Their coming off of hard loss to Fnatic at the DHW Semis, so they're sure to looking to refuel confidence, and they clearly have the firepower to do it. HellRaisers on the other hand, had strung together a few decent performances versus some mid-tiered teams, but then fell in a 3 map bout against London Conspiracy. So there's certainly concern about this game, particularly when HR has not found much success against T1 teams. We'll like watch this elimination match take place on de_cache, de_cbble, and de_overpass. But here's another case where the Poles are pretty much favored throughout the entire map-pool. HR could manage to take a map, especially since the Polish are prone to random 'nay' moments, but we doubt PashaBiceps and gang are gonna fail on more than once in this game, so they're out pick for an Avg bet. However, we highly suggest to keep an eye on percentages before placing it, and eventually just go for an ICB on HR if values will move to 85/15 or so.
http://csgo.guru/match/3158!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7230!$EnVyUs!$Dignitas!$EnVyUs!$0.6!$0.77!$-0.17000000000000004!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Here is the second match of the StarSeries Last-Chance Bracket, where the winner will move on to face the winner of the preceeding exTSM/E-frag bout. Since Luminosity pulled the upset to eliminate EnvyUs from DHW, they've had a challenge of regaining their form. This includes consecutive losses to Titan and NaVi as this event, however they did show signs of resurgence as they dispatched E-frag in decisive fashion a few days back, which earned them the chance to play today. Meanwhile Dignitas has had a very similar past several games, although they've gone winless in the Group Stage 2 of the event. But they broke their losing streak with an exceptional performance over NaVi in their most recent game. But overall, the Danes have had difficulties when facing T1 opponents, including their last several meetings with NV. As for maps, according to the veto pattern, we expect to watch de_cache, de_cbble, and de_mirage. Though EnVyUs is advantaged on all three maps, we feel Dignitas best chances to take a map will be Cobblestone, where they've shown some of their best stuff lately. Current betting Odds are heavily favoring NV, and we agree with this. Despite some of the bumps the Frenchmen stumbled on along the way here, we honestly we wouldn't be surprised if Happy and friends take this in a plain 2-0, so they're our pick for Average Bet. However, we suggest once again to keep an eye on percentages, and eventually skip if values aren't profitbale or hit the 90/10 threshold

But there's really not too much to discuss regarding this mixed T2-T3 matchup. Vexed hasn't been playing many relevant matches over the past few weeks. But in their games versus T3 teams the Polish side have mostly performed on par to their ranking. On the past quarter they've established themselves as a solid third tier team, but absent of any significant firepower, however we need to underline that they always step-up a lot when facing T1 teams, and we shouldn't forget that they already managed to hit 2 Majors, so they cannot be underestimated. As for APM, there's a chance, they could manage to grab one of the 4 playoff spots out of Group B. Meanwhile Gamers2 are likely one of the locks to qualify for the APM playoffs, but this will only be their 2nd game out of the 7 to qualify, so they'll have a busier APM schedule in the short-term. As for the recent action, G2 has been a pretty decent and played vs higher leveled teams (including a 2-0 sweep of ex-TSM and 6 straight wins over Virtus.Pro). So they're amongst hotter T2 teams. As for this match, G2 are obviously the superior crew, and have greater strength and experience throughout the extended map-pool. Additionally, we should remember that Rain is back, so this restores their full potential. Based on the Veto pattern, theres good chances we'll see de_dust2 and de_train. But regardless of the selection, we're confident Maikelele and cast will walk away with no less with a tie, so an Avg pick on G2 should be kinda safe. However, with the current Betting Odds already quite bad and still decreasing, we suggest to keep an eye on the percentages and eventually skip if values hit the 90/10 threshold.
http://csgo.guru/match/3168!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7254!$G2!$LC!$null!$0.6!$0.85!$-0.25!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Second match in a row for Gamers2, as well as their second APM contest today. Just like their first match, this one might not be as easy to call as may look at first sight. As we already discussed in the previous match, overall G2 has been a team of improvement, as they climb the T2 ranks. And in this progression, they they've played up to form against all their opponents, regardless of rank. Which we credit as a huge attribute, since they seem to take every contest seriously. Now with Rain back in their ranks, we're oriented in considering the mix balanced again. London Conspiracy on the other hand, are one of our newer Challenger teams to splash in to the international scene. And they certainly made this match more interesting following quite an impressive and surprising victory over HellRaisers. Prior to that, over the short-term, they appeared to be one of the stronger 'challengers' to break into T3. So this match may be a timely measuring stick. There's not basis for predicting the veto here, but we can safely add that G2 should advantaged throughout the maps. This is appropriately reflected by the Current Betting Odds in favor of G2. We're inclined to agree with this, so while percentages remain rewarding for an Average Bet, G2 is our pick with a worst case scenario of a tie with the silly Bo2 format.
http://csgo.guru/match/3169!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7242!$HR!$Dignitas!$Dignitas!$0.5!$0.43!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is probably the best match we'll watch today. HellRaisers have hit a bit a slide toward inconsistency over the past quarter. But in the last 2 weeks, looked to have regained form, earning wins over Mouz and SK. Yet kUcheR and co. failed to take LC serioulsy on the extended map-pool and lost a Bo3. But after a couple days off, bounced right back yesterday to beat Virtus.Pro. So we're talking about a team featuring a kinda unpredictable pattern. Dignitas on the other hand, have had a rough past 2 weeks. With the exception of one strong outing versus Natus Vincere, the Danes have been a bit of punching bag for som of the best in the game. But today, they have a chance to reach the Red Dot offline event and a shot at the $50K prizepool. Winner of this game will advance to play EnvyUs Talking about maps, this is a Bo3, and there's good chance we'll watch de_cbble, de_mirage, and de_overpass. If the veto will go so, Overpass may go in favor of Dignitas, while HR should be able to take home Cobblestone, and Mirage is going to be mostly a 50/50 fight. Currently Betting Odds are kinda mixed/balanced but generally in favor of the Danes, at our end we see this as a pure even contest. Picking a side in a match like this isn't easy at all, but we're a bit more oriented in trying our luck with a Low pick on HR, mostly because lately they looked slightly more in form compared to Dignitas.

Mousesports have been quite inconsistent over the last quarter, and seem to go on small runs of wins and losses. They haven't been in action for about a week, but looked decent in their last game versus CSGL, but overall we aren't talking about a super relevant opponent and we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Germans struggling a bit in the first map due the low amount of training. Additionally the impact of the new Update shouldn't be underestimated since the changes on the M4/AK spray threshold may force some players in adjusting a bit. On the other hand Hellraisers are kinda inconsistent, and despite the great show they managed to setup against VP, they still faced serious issues in messing with Dignitas. So overall they're a team following a pretty unpredictable pattern. Betting odds are slightly in favor of Mouz, but still decent for sticking with a Low bet on them, even if the chance to see just a Tie is pretty high, in particular if we'll watch de_overpass and de_cbble as maps.
http://csgo.guru/match/3171!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7282!$Liquid!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.4!$0.18!$0.22000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$First match of ESL/ESEA Finals, and surely a quite interesting one. EnvyUs are stepping into this game after a quite disappointing run at FACEIT Finals together with a series of kinda mixed online results. Even if lately the Frenchmen finally managed to move back on the right track, we're still talking about a team that's not facing their brightest moment, and that reached the end of the year with a lot of stress on their back. However, Liquid aren't a super scary opponent, in particular considering that Moe is standing-in for Elige, so we really can't see them moving too far in the Groups, and for sure the Bo3 format isn't going to help them against EU teams. Worth noting that Liquid basically never played officially since DHW, and with most of the NA players more excited about FPL than about ESL ESEA Finals we have serious doubts about the form of the whole team. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_cbble, de_cache and de_dust2. If the veto will go so, Cobblestone and Dust2 should be in favor of EnvyUs, while Cache may go both ways. Betting odds are currently quite skewed in favor of the French side, and we kinda agree on this trend, so even if we're not talking about amazing percentages we're oriented in picking a Low+ bet on them. As usual keep an eye on the values and eventually skip if they drop to 90/10 or something.

With Fnatic currently peaking pretty high and featuring a great form (backed by the victories at DHW &amp; FBM Finals), they are for sure one of the teams we highly believe we'll watch moving through the groups &amp; bracket in a kinda easy fashion. Actually they are sporting the most balanced roster out there, their knowledge over the extended map-pool is almost perfect, and since in the current game we're talking about a Bo3, we don't believe that the Swedes will face too many issues in rolling over the American side. However Conquest are still a pretty dangerous team, and potentially the most challenging opponent of the NA bunch (LG excluded), their gameplay isn't easy to understand and based on quick executions and unpredictable rotations, but honestly even if this way to play might help Shahzam and co. in taking Fnatic by surprise and maybe winning a map, we don't believe they have the power for taking home the whole Bo3 yet. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_train, de_cbble and de_overpass. If the veto will go so, the Swedes should be advantaged on Train and Cobblestone, while we wouldn't be surprised to see Conquest setting up decent things on Overpass. Betting odds are still decent for going Average on Fnatic, and this is our pick as well, but we suggest to monitor the percentages since the values are dropping quickly and eventually skip if they hit the 90/10 threshold.
http://csgo.guru/match/3173!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7284!$CLG!$TSM!$TSM!$0.42!$0.15!$0.27!$HIGH RISK!$AVG BET!$Unlike the previous ESL/ESEA Finals match we covered, this is a match that relies heavily on momentum. Ex-TSM are coming out of several pretty troubling weeks, where they parted ways with TSM, while also collected a series of pretty disappointing results. Its worth mentioning their fail against SK at FBM Finals, as a prime example of their issues. However, the Danes are still a top3 team, and even if they've gone through a not so great month, there are still good chances to see them come back at the event, provided they step-in with the right mindset. CLG on the other hand, are moving here following their victory at Northern Arena. Obviously not the most prestigious tournament out there, but for sure a decent training and a good source for a boost in motivation. Especially after a couple of months where their level of consistency was way below their average. But as for the current match, CLG are surely at a disadvantage due to the Bo3 format, and even if their form is back on normal levels, we don't think they'll be able to grab more than a map against Dupreeh and co. About maps, we believe we'll watch, de_cache, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto goes this way, Overpass and Cache should be in favor of ex-TSM, while CLG may grab Mirage. Betting odds are following a pattern similar to the previous ESL/ESEA games, so we're not talking about extremely even percentages or profitable ones, however at our end we're oriented towards playing safe and going Avg on TSM. But just wait and double check percentages before picking a side, because values are still moving a lot.

Lately, Luminosity showed impressive form, during FACEIT Finals they played out of their minds, and actually provided some of the most enjoyable matches of the year. Actually they are one of the few teams who are peaking, and overall, they are looking fresher compared to most of the big names taking part in the last semi-Major of the year. Even if Group B is surely messier than Group A, they have legitimate chances to move ahead. But obviously they can't overlook any match if they want to hit the bracket. On the other hand, Natus Vincere faced some stuttering right after Cluj. They still showed good things particularly against T1 teams, but currently their issues against T2 teams has grown even worse, and they continue underestimating their opponents, especially the ones they don't face on a regular basis. This is an extremely dangerous attitude, in particular when fighting a team like LG who don't allow any 'break' but keep baiting and moving quickly, so we're pretty sure that GuardiaN and co. will face a certain amount of problems in facing the Brazilians. About maps, we believe we'll see, de_overpass, de_inferno and de_dust2. If this is how the veto goes, both teams should be quite aligned on all of them, and we'll probably watch an extremely close game with high potential for Overtimes as well. Betting odds are skewed in favor of NaVi, but at our end we're not prone in giving them an edge higher than just 2% (and just due to the higher experience). So basically, we're talking about a pure 50/50 match. However, we're oriented in taking advantage of the slightly more rewarding odds by going with a Low pick on LG, with the hope to watch the Brazilians setting up a show similar to the one we watched @ DHW.

E-Frag are surely an promising team, and even if they're still a bit unbalanced they consistently managed to setup good fights against T2 opponents and sometimes T1 ones. Obviously their recent match history doesn't really look exciting, but after-all they mostly faced top-5 teams, so it's quite understandable and these results are totally in line with the T2 average. On the other hand London Conspiracy are the most promising 'Challenger' team so far (== the 'new' teams we're evaluating for the World Ranking), and in the past weeks they displayed pretty good things, offering great fights against established teams such as G2 and HR, so we believe we'll watch the Norwegians doing fine in this game as well. About maps, we'll probably watch: de_cache, de_overpass and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, Inferno will likely go to LC, while Overpass should be in slightly favor of EFrag, and Cache is kinda random. Honestly this is a tricky match to predict, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch the veto session taking a different path too, overall we're oriented in considering this game as a pretty balanced one, and then we're slightly more prone in attempting a Low- bet on LC due the more rewarding odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/3197!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7315!$EnVyUs!$Fnatic!$EnVyUs!$0.45!$0.38!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Certainly one of the most exciting matchups of the day, and one many see as the potential Grand Finalists. Since about a week after Cluj, EnvyUs have been challenged with issues of inconsistency, but for their entry game with Liquid, the Frenchman surely look to be in good form to conlude the year. KennyS and gang dominated the Americans on Cache right from the first half. On Cobblestone, the competetition was a bit more aligned, but NV never at any point lost control of the game. A fairly quick 2-0 sweep, and the French move to the winner's circle to face the fiercely rolling Swedes. Fnatic has obviously been on fire lately, coming off a fresh FBM championship, they handled Conquest in decisive fashion, lead by the charge of Olofmeister on Mirage. And then on Inferno, the Swedes steamrolled through the first 14 rds, and mixed things up on the buy-in when they all went with the auto-shotgun. However, a map shy of match point, the trollish move was unsucessful, and Conquest finally offered some resistence taking the following 9 rounds. But too little, too late. And now the top two teams in the World will battle it out for the first spot in the semi-finals. There's no love loss between these two, with a rather extensive match history, for today's bout we're expecting to see de_train, de_inferno, and de_cbble. Should the veto go this way, NV should be advantaged on Train, while Fnatic should've an edge on Inferno, leaving Cobblestone capable of going either way. Betting Odds trending in favor of Fnatic, and we're of similar opinion. Percentages are still rewarding enough for a Low Bet on them, but keep in mind this is not an elimination match so they may play a bit more conservative to save some things for the end stage.
http://csgo.guru/match/3198!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7318!$Liquid!$Conquest!$Liquid!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$First elimination match of the ESL ESEA S2 Finals, and certainly a much more interesting match than may appear at first look. This was essentially an expected matchup considering the entry game opponents both these NA Teams had to face. Obviously they both received lessons of humility, and they both enter this contest looking to win their first map of the tournament. As previously mentioned ealier, Liquid suffered a convincing loss vs Envy. But finally started to put some things together preserved some dignity with a 14-16 loss on Cbble. So they have something positive the look towards when dealing with the Canadians. Conquest on the other hand, weren't able to provide quite as much push-back in their 0-2 sweep at the hands of Fnatic. But to their credit, they did attempt to comeback when in down 0-14 and managed to win 10 rds before the Swedes closed the match. Additionally, Conquest wasn't really even on the radar earlier in the year. As you can see according to our Drank rankings, they've demostrated the greastest improvement as a team in the short-term, progressing leaps 'n bounds over the past months. And compared to Liquid, the Canadians have very limited Lan experience. That said, being shaky in entry stage of a Lan event vs the best in the world is both understandable and expected. So we feel they'll be much more relaxed on Day 2, and should surely offer up something much closer to their form. As for this duel, we expect high probability of the veto selecting de_cache, de_train, and de_cbble. If these are the maps, cache should have a slight edge on cache, while Conquest should have the advantage on Train, Cobblestone could easily go either way depending on who seizes the momentum. Currently the Betting Odds are trending in favor of the more experienced Americans, however on our end, as mentioned above, we're anticpating a much different Conquest from what we saw yesterday. Over the short-term, they've done well developing approriate strats for dealing with the NA business and think they can overcome their nerves to reach the Decider match. So we're more oriented in taking advantage of the skewed percentages and trying our luck with an ICB on Conquest.

Overall they looked a bit revitalized, for sure a bit fresher compared to their latest kinda disappointing shows. So we can say that they are on the good path for regaining their momentum. On the other hand Natus Vincere had to work slightly harder in order to take home a victory over Luminosity. GuardiaN and friends managed to grab de_dust2 pretty smoothly, but they experienced more issues with Inferno, where the Brazilians managed to hit the Overtime. Anyway the OT featured a NaVi dominance and closed pretty quickly. This is basically a pure 50/50 game, we wouldn't be surprised to watch the 3rd map kicking-in or even require OTs. Both teams are fully capable of grabbing a victory, so we're talking about the riskiest game of the today's batch. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto goes so, both teams faced these maps plenty of times and they are all pretty balanced. However, former TSM should have a little edge on Dust2, while Overpass should be in favor of NaVi. Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are still sitting in the middle, but at our end we're oriented in gambling on the return of Dupreeh and friends, so our pick is a Low bet on ex-TSM.

CLG didn't impress at all, and even if they moved here after winning the Northern Arena lan, they've still shown rather relevant limits when it comes to facing top-tier EU teams. In this case, however, things may roll a bit better, since this is basically a domestic match. But this will still not be an easy one, since LG has proven themselves amongst the most reliable North American teams. Luminosity had quite a shaky entry game. On [Dust2] they kept making the same mistakes over and over, while on Inferno they didn't manage the end-game properly, and they failed the Overtime pretty badly. About maps, we believe we'll watch de_mirage, de_cache and de_cbble come out of the veto. If it goes that way, CLG may grab Cobblestone, while Mirage should be in favor of LG, leaving Cache as mostly 50/50. Betting odds are trending in favor of Luminosity, and this is correct since they surely feature a stronger momentum together with better organization compared to CLG, so we're oriented in going Low+ on them as well. However percentages are still moving a lot, so keep an eye on them and eventually evaluate a skip if they drop too much.

Fnatic surely struggled against EnVyUs more than we were expecting, but since the Frenchmen are currently the 2nd team in the world, their performance is fully understandable, even if we were hoping to see at least a 3rd map. However, Liquid are a whole different story, they had issues in moving over Conquest, and with a slightly more effort Shahzam and co. could have kept the match on an even tighter score. Additionally we don't believe that playing with a stand-in can take Liquid too far, in particular against a team such as Fnatic. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_inferno, de_cache and de_mirage. If the veto goes so the Swedes should be fairly advantaged on all of them, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch a 2-0 sweep. Betting odds already turned into trash. The current percentages aren't really profitable and they'll likely get even worse in the next hours. If you really want to pick a side, the way to go is Fnatic, but you should seriously consider a skip because final values will be around 90/10.

Yesterday, Luminosity failed to impress against Natus Vincere, and even if they managed to reach the Overtime on de_inferno, they still failed in bringing the game to map 3. However, now they have another shot, and with the fear of going out early we're sure, that the Brazilians will try to provide their very best, in order to show that what they put up @ FACEIT Finals wasn't a fluke. On the other hand, NaVi failed pretty hard against ex-TSM, and they finished both maps kinda far from the OT threshold, overall we were expecting something more from GuardiaN and friends. Especially after the convincing show against LG. As a team, NaVi are heavily momentum based, so they aren't an easy team to predict nor one to face. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch them having issues against LG, even though just a day ago, they managed to take them down in a quick 2-0 sweep. About maps, according to our Veto Pattern graph we'll watch: de_dust2, de_inferno and de_overpass. If this is how it goes, NaVi should have an edge on Dust2 while both Inferno and Overpass are basically pure 50/50. Betting odds are obviously skewed in favor of NaVi, while real-world ones are a bit more balanced. At our end we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low- bet on LG, mostly because we believe that Luminosity can provide a slightly better show than what they displayed so far.

Fnatic Yesterday showed some limits against EnvyUs, but then they moved back to the right path, thanks to a pretty convincing performance against Liquid. So we truly believe they'll play on par with ex-TSM, despite the earlier poor show vs the Frenchmen. On the other hand, Dupreeh and friends had slightly better run, and after a pretty easy entry game versus CLG, didn't sweat too much in rolling over NaVi as well. So far the Danes have shown some extremely good things, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them reach the Grand Final. This is basically a pure 50/50 game, where we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_inferno and de_mirage as maps. If the veto goes this way, Fnatic should have an edge on Inferno, while Dust2 might go to ex-TSM, leaving mirage which can easily go both ways. Betting odds are slightly in favor of Fnatic, and percentages are still decent for going Low on them, so we're oriented in taking this path. However, we suggest to avoid huge bets and just enjoy this great match-up.
http://csgo.guru/match/3257!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7335!$EnVyUs!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.55!$0.69!$-0.1399999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Well, now we're in the thick of this tournament. Excellent contest in the other semifinal, and here we also have a very interesting matchup as well. EnVyUs has looked fierce so far, first rolling over Liquid in the entry matchup with a convincing 2-0 sweep. Then, with their momentum in full swing, they met Fnatic in the winners' match, as the slight underdog, where you could argue they beat the Swedes with even more decisiveness for another 2 map sweep. So overall, there isn't much flaw in their game at the moment. Provided they keep their heads about them, and stick to their game even if they fall behind, they have a good chance of being able to continue their Bo3 victory streak. Natus Vincere on the other hand, also looked strong in their entry game vs LG. But the winner's match against exTSM was far less encouraging with a quick 0-2 loss. But they responded quite well when surviving the elimination match again vs LG. That one did require the 3rd map, and going into the 2nd half of Cobblestone it was an even contest. Usually NaVi has issues with finishing/closing out matches, but here they took control and showed the Brazilians the door. But here they have their hands full in this one. As for this match, it should be a very entertaining one. The past contests have yielded pretty even results, and they've never failed to put on a good show. As for the veto, we expect good chances to see de_dust2, de_train, and de_mirage. But really, these two have played much of the map-pool, and neither team has really proved a very decisive map edge. So again momentum will play a large factor in this bout. Betting Odds are skewed well in favor of Frenchmen, and we're inclined to agree considering their form thus far. So unless odds breach the ICB threshold, our pick is Low Bet on Happy and the gang.

Fnatic moved here pretty seamlessly, of course they had some stutters against EnVyUs on Friday, but then they easily dismissed Liquid and ex-TSM with a couple of quick 2-0 sweeps, and advanced to the last stage. Now with a wide knowledge on the extended map-pool, and basically no must-veto maps, they have serious chances of taking home yet another trophy, potentially the third in a row after FACEIT and FBM. On the other hand Natus Vincere are slightly unexpected Grand Finalist. Right after their Cluj performance, GuardiaN &amp; friends faced their fair share of issues, in regaining form and motivation. They didn't enter ESL/ESEA Finals as huge favorites. Both exTSM and EnvyUs were ranked better; but when nobody expected it, NaVi always showed up. And their double victory over LG and the domination over EnVyUs clearly indicated that they've always had an ace up their sleeve. However, their consistency isn't quite on par with Fnatic, and there are several maps where they sometimes experience stutters, so they'll enter the Grand Final as underdogs. About the maps, Inferno and Cobblestone should be clearly advantage of the Swedes, while most of the others can easily go both ways, with Overpass to be vetoed. Betting odds are trending in favor of the Flusha's team, and this is correct since they have a fair advantage, so we're oriented in agreeing with this trend and we suggest a Low+ pick on Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/3262!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7353!$Dignitas!$HR!$Dignitas!$0.52!$0.71!$-0.18999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$GO:CL Grand-Final and surely a quite good Tier2 derby. Dignitas didn't play too much in the past week, but in their last match before the little break, they faced HR in a Bo3 contest, and they managed to take it home with a quick 2-0 sweep, surely quite promising since today they have to face them one more time. As usual when we talk about the Danes, worth noting that their consistence against T1 teams always been pretty lackluster, and then their short-term results aren't really looking stellar, however they should have a slightly easier run in the current T2 match-up. On the other hand HellRaisers are a kinda dangerous team, they are quite unpredictable and prone in upsetting T1 lineups too, unfortunately they aren't really rock solid in games featuring the extended map-pool, and on the long run we don't believe we'll watch them taking home the whole Bo5, even if they can definitely grab a couple of maps. About the veto session, according with our Graph we'll likely watch de_dust2 and de_cache vetoed off, while in the rest of the pool Dignitas should be advantaged on Mirage and Overpass, and Train, Cobblestone &amp; Inferno can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Danish side, and this is correct since they are for sure better trained for handling this kind of format. However we need to underline that the current percentages are a bit too skewed, and actually still dropping, so unless the values will move back to more reasonable amounts, we're more oriented in playing the odds by going Low- on HR. Surely a risky pick, but after-all we're talking about a match that will be a bit closer than expected.

Gamers2 already underestimated E-Frag once, and didn't end well, so we just hope to watch them being a bit more careful and focused. On paper G2 are surely advantaged, they are one of the trending T2 teams, and even if they didn't play stellar in the past weeks we believe they are coming back from their little break with their batteries regenerated. As already mentioned, E-Frag took down G2 already once, and generally in their previous contests they always managed to keep Maikelele and co. on the edge, so we wouldn't be surprised to see the Bulgarians taking home a map. However, the Bo2 format is a bit in favor of G2, and we don't believe we'll watch them losing twice, so in the worst case we'll likely watch just a Tie. Betting odds aren't really exceptional, and overall not so exciting, but at our end we're oriented in playing safe and going for an Avg pick on G2. As usual, keep an eye on the percentages, and eventually skip if the values drop below the 15/85 mark.

HellRaisers are moving here after their yesterday's 2-3 loss against Dignitas in the GO:CL Grand Final, honestly they achieved a score in line with our expectations, and after-all they provided a consistent fight during the whole Bo5. Overall HR are sporting a quite decent form, and they should be able to roll over the Germans without sweating too much, and eventually with a plain 2-0 sweep. On the other hand Penta didn't play too much in the short-term, and in the past month they mostly faced local teams and just a limited bunch of International ones, so their form is a bit of a question mark. However, this lineup rarely impressed so we don't really believe we'll watch an upset. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_cache, de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto will go so, HR should be advantaged on both Cache and Overpass, while Mirage is going to be a pure 50/50 fight. Betting odds are trending in favor of HR, and we quite agree on this, so we're oriented in picking a Low+/Avg- bet on HellRaisers.

However, Titan despite they didn't play too much in the short-term shouldn't face any real issue in rolling over LDLC White in this all-French derby. LDLC generally can setup something decent against T3 and low T2 teams only, and in most of the cases they aren't really capable of setting up a consitent fight in Bo3 clashes, so we highly doubt they'll manage to grab a map. So this contest will likely end with a plain 2-0 in favor of Shox and friends. As already mentioned, percentages are quite terrible and not profitable, so you can skip the whole thing without regrets.

Mousesports are surely doing decently, and even if in the short-term they overlooked some matches, they are still one of the most promising Tier2 lineups. However Dendd shouldn't be underestimated, this kind of Nordic mixes are always extremely unpredictable and potentially very dangerous, as we observed in the past weeks when they almost managed to take down TSM. Overall we don't believe that Dendd have the map-knowledge needed to take home a 2-0 victory against Mouz, but we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking a map and forcing the Germans into a (one more) Tie. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of Mouz, while real-world ones are more around 60/40. Surely the Bo2 format adds an extra layer of protection, but with these percentages we're slightly more oriented in gambling with an ICB on Dendd. Mostly because Mouz didn't play too much in December and actually we're a bit unsure about their form.
http://csgo.guru/match/3269!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7391!$FSid3!$Vexed!$Vexed!$0.6!$0.73!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another game featuring not so great Odds. However, this is going to be a pretty interesting clash since DavCost just moved out from FlipSid3 (to TeamYP), so Markeloff and friends will play this game with S1mple as stand-in. Surely a quite unexpected pick since S1mple moved out from the Ukrainian team right after ESWC 2015, blaming the rest of the roster and claiming that he wasn't going to play again with them in the future. Anyway, talking about the match itself, Vexed aren't an easy opponent to face, surely they aren't famous for showing-up in the headlines and they always keep a pretty low profile, but worth remembering that we're talking about a lineup that managed to qualify to 2 Majors so far, and overall always provided troubles to a wide amount of high-T2 teams in the past, so you shouldn't be surprised to watch the Polish side setting up decent things. About maps, we'll probably watch: de_cbble, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, F3 should be able to take home Overpass and Train, while Vexed may grab Cobblestone. Betting odds are trending in favor of FlipSid3, and we're prone to agree, even if we're a bit unsure about the potentially explosive situation within the F3 roster, since there is a serious risk to watch them tilting. However, we're oriented in following the map advantage, so our pick is F3, but we don't suggest to go with values above Low.

Luminosity has hit some shaky times sinece their incredible push at the FACEIT S3 Finals, where the Brazilians bumped off some EU's best, one after the next, but Fnatic ended that run at the grand finals. Since then, LG competed at the ESL ESEA Finals, only managing to beat CLG, and fall twice to NaVi. And now they'll look to get back to winning ways against some fellow NA competition. compLexity made their last relevant appearance in Northern Arena 2015, where they were swept by CLG in the Grand Final. Prior to that, coL hasnt been able to restore their form months past, and has repeatedly struggled with creating any consistency. However, this will likely not be the match they need to get back to the win column. On paper, LG is the superior team, particularly in a game featuring the extended map-pool. For this Bo3 we're expecting to see de_inferno, de_cbble, and de_dust2, and honestly, the Brazilians should be advantaged on all 3 maps so we wouldn't be surprsied to see them grab this straight 2-0. Betting Odds are expected well skew in favor in LG, which we surely agree with. As long as percentages remaining rewarding for a pick, a Low+/Avg- Bet on on LG is our pick.

Cloud9 is still the team ruling on the NA scene, but in their last several relevant matches, they didn't play to the level we've grown accustomed to seeing from them. But competing against the lowered tiered opposition has resulted in any shocking outcomes. It is however worth noting they will be playing with a yet to be announced 5th man since the departure of seang@res from the team. So that may even the playing field slightly. Enemy on the other hand, is still a mid-T2 team, whose performances have been mostly aligned to that level. And they haven't managed to achieve much in the short-term, but did manage to upset C9 previously, while taking advantage of C9's slump at that time in October. But aisde from taht, they've still got areas to improve before they can ascend the 2nd tier. Coming into this match, NME has only managed to beat low-end opponents, so here is another opportunity for them to break the pattern, and attempt to repeat a previous upset. Betting odds are already turned to trash, so we're oriented in considering a skip. But if you really want to make a pick you should just sick with C9.

Today CLG dismissed FNS from their active roster and actually we don't know yet who will be picked as stand-in. Overall, CLG aren't playing at the peak of their game, and with the team currently being restructured, we doubt we'll see them playing at their best. However, as mentioned above, we highly doubt that Tarik and co. will waste their chance to move on in the bracket, and honestly SPLYCE aren't really a super scary opponent. Overall we might watch Splyce taking home a map, but even if they aren't doing too bad currently they aren't really any better than just the avg T2 team, so we don't think they'll manage to send CLG home early in a game featuring the Bo3 format. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on CLG, so we're oriented in playing safe and sticking with them.

Overall this is a change that we're not sure will pay off on the long term, surely Spiidi and Nex used to form a pretty dangerous duo, but dismissing Gob B, one of the legendary masterminds of the CS scene is surely a quite risky move. Anyway, talking about the current game, CSGL are cruising in troubled waters since a while, their short-term results (against serious opponents) haven't been really exciting and they always struggled on games featuring the extended map-pool, so even if they could be able to take advantage of the Mouz's roster changes, we don't believe they'll manage to take more than a map. About the veto session, we believe we'll watch: de_cache, de_mirage and de_dust2. If these will be the maps, Mouz should have an edge on both Cache and Dust2, while we wouldn't be surprised to watch CSGL taking Mirage. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on Mouz, so we're oriented in following this path as well.
http://csgo.guru/match/3285!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7413!$coL!$Conquest!$Conquest!$0.45!$0.32!$0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$CompLexity has been kinda out of action lately while competing in minor qualifiers, and forfeited a few matches that conflicted with schedule. However, this is the Quarter-Final of the NA Qualifier for the E-league's Road to Vegas, so this cannot really be forfeited. Previously we've mentioned the continued struggles with consistency, and last time we watched them perform, was in their Grand Finals loss to CLG in Northern Arena, a little less than two weeks ago. But historically, they've had good competition with the Canadians. Conquest on the other hand, has also been a bit random. They've demonstrated great potential, but have started to show a pattern of failing everytime they start to gain some momentum. they're entering this match following a few tough losses to Liquid and Fnatic, but at least showed some positive things in both competitions. As for this match, we likely watch de_cbble, de_de_inferno, and de_overpass. Should the veto go this way, coL may have a slight edge on Cobblestone, and Conquest should be advantaged on Inferno, while Overpass could go either way. Our end is in line with current Betting Odds, giving favor on Conquest, so they're our pick for Low Bet.

Gamers2 had to sweat more than expected in dismissing Arcade in their entry game. Overall, they looked a bit rusty and slow, in addition to the fact they've not played too much in December, could potentially be a real issue. Especially since G2 has a roster which historically has faced serious consistency problems with kinda random peaks/drops. On the other hand, Dignitas didn't move here with ease either, their game against SK was extremely close, including a pretty long Overtime as well. But honestly, this isn't really surprising, SK has stepped up a lot lately, and recently Dignitas was dealing with roster changes, so now they're probably going to need a bit of extra time in order to regain their full form. Talking about maps, we believe we'll watch: de_inferno, de_train, de_mirage. If the veto goes this way, Inferno should be in favor of G2, while we wouldn't be surprised to watch Dignitas take Train, and Mirage should mostly be an even contest. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Maikelele and friends, and this is quite understandable since they certainly feature higher potential, however we don't suggest to underestimate the Danes, because they can definitely deliver a good fight. At our end we're oriented in picking a Low bet on G2, mostly because they are slightly more reliable in relevant games, but overall we're talking about quite a risky match that can easily go both ways.
http://csgo.guru/match/3292!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7423!$TSM!$EnVyUs!$TSM!$0.45!$0.43!$0.020000000000000018!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Today we're entering the EU match-ups full-throttle, with the pedal to the metal! The first tiered game of the day, featuring EnVyUs battling against ex-TSM with a StarSeries LAN spot up for grabs. So we're talking about an extremely relevant match, particularly since StarSeries bumped their prizepool to $200K this year, surely enough to make the Lan Finals extremely appealing. Especially for two teams who in the short-term are kinda lacking some top-notch results. Anyway, talking about the current game, as you may guess real-world odds are basically aligned around 50/50. Both sides have stuttered some over the past weeks, and even though the Frenchmen have looked slightly better, we believe that former TSM are ready to comeback after a fairly disappointing month, which brought a lot of unneeded pressure over their heads (due to all the org-related issues). About the veto session, we believe we'll watch: de_inferno, de_dust2 and de_cache. Should we see these maps, Inferno should be in favor of EnVyUs, while TSM may have an edge on Dust2 (lately they stepped up considerably on this map), and Cache is going to be kinda random. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of Happy &amp; co. but since we're talking about a Top3 match we don't really agree with these percentages, and both teams definitely have the talent for keeping the odds around the middle. So at our end we're oriented in taking advantage of the values by going Low on the former TSM squad.
http://csgo.guru/match/3293!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7429!$DenDD!$SK!$SK!$0.44!$0.35!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not the obvious game as may look at first sight. As we've stated plenty of times already, Dendd are definitely more dangerous than what they may seem, despite the not so exciting match history. If you dig into these previous matches you'll see that the Nordic mix have always managed to put up relevant fights, and never dropped without giving their very best. This kind of team, even if they don't yet feature any complex teamplay, they are kind of a pain in the ass to deal with, and you shouldn't be surprised to watch Twist and co. play well. Anyway, SK are surely one of the hottest teams of the moment. They've moved up in T3 in pretty good fashion, and now with a stable roster and an high form, they are surely a pretty dangerous T2 contender. Its worth noting, that we're talking about a Bo2 match-up, so there are higher chances to watch just a Tie. Overall, SK should be able to grab at least one map, so we're oriented in playing it safe, sticking with them for a Low bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/3294!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7435!$Vexed!$CSGL!$CSGL!$0.48!$0.38!$0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Polish derby and a pretty surprising match-up, because nobody really expected to watch Vexed and CSGL move ahead in the Road to Vegas Qualifier, since they were both facing high-tiered opponents in their entry games. Vexed had to deal with Fsid3, and they dismissed them with a quick and decisive 2-0 sweep, despite the Ukrainian side attempting to play the Jolly by fielding S1mple. On the other hand, CSGL are kinda peaking at the moment, and they're currently sitting on a decent streak they haven't seen in a pretty long time. Against Mouz, they mostly took advantage of the roster changes that the Germans enforced the same day, but despite this, their performance was top-notch and backed by a brilliant veto session. Talking about the current game, it looks like Vexed are fielding a stand-in, and this may move the needle in favor of CSGL, even if their performances in Bo3 games always relied too much on veto. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_overpass, de_train and de_cbble. If the veto goes so, Overpass should be in favor of Vexed, while Train and Cobblestone can easily go both ways. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of CSGL, (due to the aforementioned stand-in), but you should remember that this is a domestic match, and it will likely follow a different pattern compared to International games (Vexed are fully aware of the couple of maps where CSGL are exceptional), so we'll likely watch a close game despite the sub. So we're oriented in picking an ICB/Low- bet on Vexed in order to take advantage of the better percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/3295!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7438!$WinterFox!$Splyce!$WinterFox!$0.55!$0.41!$0.14000000000000007!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Another match that may be closer than would seem at first look. Winterfox in the past weeks has really struggled to get their game going. Honestly, we were expecting more consistency from them by now, but in most of their relevant contests they've come out on the wrong side of the scoreboard. However, the victory yesterday that ensured their spot in the next ESL/ESEA season could have finally woke up them a little. SPLYCE on the other, has kinda been a surprise lately, putting up a much greater challenge than expected in their relevant matches. We touched on their recent tenure in the overveiw for their Road to Vegas contest before this with NME. And actually, the outcome of that match, may offer deeper insight about what we can expect for this game. Either way, they are certainly one of challenger teams nipping at the heels of such T3 teams as Wfx. So these matches carry their own significance in that regard. The Bo3 format applies for this game as well, which should favor Wfx with the extended map-pool, but in their past 4 matches in October, SPLYCE took 3 of the 4 contests. For the most part, they were closely fought battles. However, for this game, SPLYCE is likely playing with slightly higher form with respect to a busier schedule. So in line with the Betting Odds trending in their favor, SPLYCE is our pick for Low Bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/3296!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7439!$Splyce!$NME!$NME!$0.48!$0.51!$-0.030000000000000027!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Kind of an interesting match-up as we make our way into the NA Semi-Final qualifiers for the Road to Vegas, particularly since the highest ranked teams in the Quarter Finals were already shown an early exit. SPLYCE got that trend rolling with an impressive 2-0 sweep of CLG, in a contest they mostly dominated after the first half of the first map. Prior to that, they had been generally rolling over all the below T3 teams on their schedule. So they've looked to be a potential 'challenger' team. However, they are entering this match following an 0-2 loss to Method that kept them from earning a spot in the ESL ESEA for Seaon 3. So for them, this contest may have more at stake for these up and comers. Enemy on the other hand, also had to dispatch a higher rank opponent in Cloud9 in order to advance through to the semifinals, and chance to represent NA at the Lan event at CES in Vegas. NME showed some impressive effort as they swept past the T1 C9 cast. And honestly, NME played as the dominant team on both maps there, never having seemed to be at risk of losing. Considering how they've played in most of their recent matches versus relevant opponents, that outing was long overdue. As for this match, these two have faced off a few times over the past quarter, and Relyks and friends have owned the edge in the majority of those contests. After what they brought to C9, we're expecting this pattern to continue. As for the maps in this bo3, we expect to watch de_cbble, de_train, and de_ inferno. Should the veto go this way, NME should be slightly favored on Cobblestone and Train, while Inferno could go either way. Current Betting Odds are moving around some, and actually giving the edge to SPLYCE, but still our real world odds at just about a 50/50 competition. We wouldn't be surprised see this game require a third map or OTs. On our end, we're slightly more oriented in favoring Enemy, for Low Bet and the more rewarding percentages as of current.
http://csgo.guru/match/3297!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7448!$Dignitas!$CSGL!$CSGL!$0.58!$0.67!$-0.09000000000000008!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the only tiered EU match on the schedule for today, but overall, quite a relevant one since the winner will qualify for the Road to Vegas $50K showmatch held during CES 2016. CSGL displayed some pretty impressive progression over the past few weeks. Yesterday they managed to keep their winning streak rolling by defeating Vexed in pretty easy fashion, despite our expectations for a slightly harder fight. However, its worth reminding that Vexed had to field a stand-in, in addition to a veto-session that didn't go well for them. Anyway, we can't deny that CSGL has regained some of their old form. On the other hand, Dignitas are currently riding a pretty nice winning streak as well. In the previous match, they rolled over G2, but earlier in the week they also won the GO:CL title with a 3-2 victory over HR. In the current match the'll play with CajunB instead of Kjaerbye, surely a relevant change since Kjaerbye has played pretty well during the past weeks. But well, CajunB is surely experienced &amp; skilled enough to fill his spot without causing any problems. As for maps, we believe we'll watch: de_cbble, de_mirage and de_overpass. If this is how the veto goes, CSGL may grab Mirage, while both Cobblestone and Overpass are going to favor Dignitas. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Dignitas, and surely the Danish side have a clear edge due to their higher consistency, so we're oriented in following this trend by going Low+ on them as well.

Enemy kicked off the surprising trend with a 2-0 sweep of Cloud9, and then rolled over SPLYCE in the semi-finals (after they eliminated CLG). At that point both the highest ranked NA competitors had been removed. And now NME finds themselves riding a bit of a hot streak, with the chance to represent NA for a shot at the $50K prizepool at CES in Vegas. Meanwhile, Conquest had a slightly easier path to follow to reach the Finals, but managed to match NME's performance, with consecutive 2-0 sweeps in their own qtr and semi finals, over compLexity and Dogmen, respectively. With all the top tiered teams out of the race, the Canadians had become the favorites out the NA. As for the current match, we're hoping the clash of momentum both teams carry into this contest, will yield an entertaining battle. The previous games between these two haven't been the most exciting, as Conquest has mostly dominated NME throughout their recent bouts. However, this is actually the some the better play we've seen form NME in some time. So they'll surely be out to alter the pattern. As for the veto, theres good chances of watching de_inferno, de_mirage, and de_overpass. And as we mentioned above, the Canadians have owned NME throughout the map pool, so they'll hold the advantage on all three. But NME's best chance to turn the tide will be on Inferno and Overpass. Regardless, Betting Odds are expectedly well skewed in favor of Conquest. Although we wouldnt be surprised to watch this game require the third map, we highly doubt Conquest will put up a failure twice with so much at stake. So they're our pick for Low Bet.

WinterFox is actually playing with more consistency than we've seen from them over the past few months. Recently their spot for ESEA S3 was in jeopardy, but Desi and co. pulled it together to retain their seat with a win over the challenging Denial. And then they faced off with today's opponent in their Group A Gameshow GSC contest, in pursuit of claiming 1 of the 2 spots for the NA region for the $200K Lan event in February, where Wfx managed a decisive 2-0 sweep. They continued their streak in another GSC match (vesus a subT3 team) to remain at the top of their Group. Not that it was the most relevant match, but the important aspect is Wfx has continued playing with some level of consistency, which as mentioned, has been one of their greatest issues in recent weeks. So this match should be a good measuring stick of that progress. SPLYCE on the other hand, has made a push recently to splash their way into the relevant side of the NA scene. There looked to be some possibility of progressing in that direction, following an impressive sweep of CLG in the Road to Vegas qualifier. However, NME ended that quickly in the Semis. Meanwhile, SPLYCE also had an opportuniy to earn a spot in the Season 3 of ESEA, but a struggling Method squad wasn't prepared to give up their spot, and SPLYCE was even able to grab 1 map. So overall, the once hopeful potential of SPLYCE has lost momentum, and remains T3, and they've additionally parted ways Stewie2k, so they'll be playing with a standin today. With regards to todays match, this is CounterPit, so the usual nonsense Bo2 format applies. There's limited data to reference, but there's good chances of seeing de_cbble and de_cache. But honestly, considering the above mentioned variables pertitnent to these teams currently, Wfx should be able keep their progress going and grab the win here today. Even worst case scenario, we'll see a tie. So our pick is in line with Current Betting Odds, for a Low bet on WinterFox.
http://csgo.guru/match/3301!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7498!$CLG!$Conquest!$Conquest!$0.43!$0.23!$0.19999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the RGN Freedom Cup Grand-Final, and will feature a format we haven't seen in a while: the 2xBo3, one with an automatic Bo3 advantage for Conquest due to them coming from the upper bracket. Obviously this kind of format is surely in advantage of Shahzam and co. since they need to only win just a single Bo3 in order to take home the trophy. But obviously winning two Bo3s in a row is surely a taller task, even for an hardened team such as CLG, who has declined in recent weeks, including a shocking 0-2 defeat at the hand of SPLYCE in the Road to Vegas Quarter Finals. We do need to note that Conquest is one of the very few North American teams still not affected by the currently on-going shuffle, and so far their roster seems to be stable. Surely a good sign, at a time of year when most of the teams are dealing with performance drops and relevant changes. On the other hand CLG just switched FNS for Fugly, and even though we're talking about a couple of players sharing a similar style of play, they probably need a bit of extra time in order to iron out the smaller details. Not much to say about the maps, both teams are pretty decent on the extended map-pool, and we wouldn't be too surprised to watch CLG take the first Bo3, but overall we have some serious doubts about them winning the whole thing. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Canadian side, and we agree with this trend, so we're oriented in playing safe by going with a low+ pick on Conquest.
http://csgo.guru/match/3302!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7529!$HR!$Vexed!$Vexed!$0.58!$0.65!$-0.07000000000000006!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just a single Tiered EU match scheduled so far, and as usual when it comes to this kind of match showing up near to Xmas, not an extremely relevant one, nor one we expect to be particularly consistent. Vexed are moving here after quite a long series of mixed results. The Polish team never really managed to follow a reliable pattern, and although they usually step-up when fighting high-tier teams, generally their performances versus mid/low-tier ones aren't too exciting. Today they're even fielding Repo as stand-in, so honestly we aren't really too oriented in trusting them too much. On the other hand, HellRaisers aren't on a brilliant streak either, and in the short term, they've collected a pretty long series of defeats. Even if we need to note that they mostly battled in kinda 50/50 games, so in this kind of balanced match, luck always play a role. Overall, they should be capable to field a decent amount of firepower, and are supposed to have a slight edge over the Poles. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_overpass, de_cbble and de_dust2. If the veto goes like so, Overpass can easily go both ways, while both Dust2 and Cobblestone should be in slight favor of HR. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of HellRaisers and we quite agree with this trend, so we're oriented in picking a Low+ bet on them since percentages are still decent for taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/3303!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7535!$Method!$WinterFox!$WinterFox!$0.48!$0.57!$-0.08999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Another slow day on the NA schedule, with only one relevant match for Counter Pit League. For the longest time, Method had one of the longest standing rosters in NA, however, the lack of any relevant victories has finally taken its toll. Going into this match, we'll see them using two stand-ins; LILMAN, and FNS in place of Toy. So obviously the scattered roster is nothing to be encouraged by, in the short term at least. As stated in the past, Method never really managed to improve their lowend ranking, but they had actually put together a few wins lately, including retaining their spot for ESEA S3. But this offers little insight for what to expect moving forward. WinterFox on the hand, looked to have started gaining some forward progress with consistency, but they held true to their past pattern and took a step backwards yesterday. Wfx failed to even pull a draw against SPLYCE last night (who were also sporting a stand-in), which was quite disappointing considering the 2-0 sweep Wfx managed against them a few days back. As for this match, these two faced off in a Starseries contest that saw Method take the win 2-1. But that was prior to the player departures. Considering the need for 2 stand-ins tonight, Wfx should be able to take advantage and get back into the win column. The usual bo2 format applies, and since Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of Method, we're more inclined to play the more rewarding percentages, especially because of the randomness due to the lineup changes. So with a worst case scenario as a tie, our pick is Low Bet on Winterfox. However, keep in mind that we're near Xmas and NA scene is currently in 'shuffle', so most of these games are pretty inconsistent, and may lead to kinda random results.
http://csgo.guru/match/3305!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7565!$Splyce!$WinterFox!$null!$0.42!$0.39!$0.02999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$And so we're back again after a short break courtesy of the holidays, and we've our first contest on the new year. Kind of a random matchup out of the NA scene, so let's begin. SPLYCE has gone through renovations during the short 'off-time', coming out the holiday with a completely new roster. The players we saw last year have parted ways with the organization, and now the lineup is composed of the former 3sUP roster. (Temporarily playing under the name 'Dogmen'). However, this evening the be'll playing with a standin (much likely Davey), making this even more difficult to preview, since we can't fully consider their match history. On the other side we have WinterFox, who showed some positive and encouraging play at the tail end of 2015. The usual challenge of consistency applies to Wfx, as in most of their matches, n issue that plagued them since the shift to NA. As we mentioned in their more recent contests, Desi and company have showed signs of progress on as far as performing consistently goes, winning 4 of their last 5 bo3s. So for them, they're entering the new year, as well as this game, in more stable form compared to the local competition. There is very little data to reference, as far as the Veto goes, but we're talking about a Counter Pit match with its bo2 format. Betting Odds are already fairly skewed in favor Wfx, which is to be expected considering the roster shuffle of Splyce. On our end, we believe that Winterfox should at the very least manage to grab one of the maps, forcing the draw. So while the percentages still remain rewarding enough, WinterFox is our pick for Low Bet. However, it's important to remember that we're talking about a game taking place right after the holidays, so both teams are joining it without a consistent practice on their shoulders, so you shouldn't be surprised to watch a quite inconsistent and kinda random match.
http://csgo.guru/match/3310!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7574!$CSGL!$OG!$OG!$0.45!$0.59!$-0.13999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the E-League 'Road to Vegas' Grand-Final and unquestionably the most interesting match-up of the day. This game will be played on a stage set up at CES 2016, currently taking place in Las Vegas, NV. The one-shot event featuring a $50,000 prize-pool, together with a spot into the upcoming E-League for the winner, is surely quite a juicy opportunity for two teams that finished the year removed from Major placements. Talking about OpTiC, it's important to remember that they are just the old Conquest squad, one of the biggest revelations of the NA scene and one of the teams we quite enjoyed the most during the past Quarter. On LAN they don't have much experience yet, but overall they are one of the few North American lineups that moved through the Xmas shuffle without performing roster changes. This is surely something in their favor, since they can just keep rolling thanks to the expertise and experience they accrued in the past months. As we already mentioned, they are a pretty peculiar team, their play style is way different compared most of the NA teams around, and could be really tricky to counter for EU opponents as well, in particular against teams favoring a passive gameplay. On the other hand CSGL had an year full of ups and downs. Well mostly downs. Since they disappointed for pretty much 3/4 of the last season (even though they finally woke up in late 2015), and frequently failed to put up threatening shows even against relatively low-tier opponents. As comparison, we can easily say that Vexed had way more solid shows than CSGL, and we're prone to considering them the 3rd team in a Polish-only regional ranking (the direct match played in late Dec doesn't really matter). However, there are surely maps where they are pretty tricky to face, in particular Mirage. So with some luck and a good veto at their end, there are good chances to watch the Poles taking the match on map3. Talking about maps, in our opinion we'll watch, de_cbble, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto goes so (and OpTiC will fail to ban Mirage as they should), there are pretty high chances to watch a quite balanced and kinda risky game. On Cobblestone the American side should have an edge, while CSGL should grab Mirage, and Train is going to be mostly a toss-up. Betting odds are currently slightly skewed in favor of CSGL, mostly because in these kind of games the faith on EU teams is generally higher, however OpTiC aren't the average NA opponent. But way more smarter and prepared on the extended map-pool, so they are our pick, and at our end we are oriented in giving them a 5% edge over the Poles, but we suggest to stay Low in value.

Both teams have been heavily involved in the NA winter shuffle, and as we've already mentioned Splyce ended up by dropping their old squad, and picked up the old 3sUP/Dogmen roster, which was overall kind of a weird choice since this lineup struggled quite a bit throughout the entire last Quarter. On the other hand, things are even more messy when discussing CompLexity, since they've basically re-created their roster, keeping only Roca and Sancz from the previous lineup. As far as our stat database is concerned, they failed to comply with our 3/5 rule, so the previous iteration of coL has been marked dead, and the new one won't inherit any of their previous results, essentially giving the current team a clean slate . On paper, the new coL roster looks pretty interesting. They brought back an old 1.6 star in Frod, added Ryx as well as the youngster Sick. This is their first official match, and we gave them a little advantage due the higher skill-ceiling compared to that of Splyce, but realistically we don't expect to watch them playing with any extremely complex tactics. But they'll likely be able to grab at least a map, thanks to their superior aim alone. Current betting odds are pretty skewed in favor of coL, and even if we gave them an edge, we're not quite confident enough in going with them now that most of the percentages are floating around 30/70. After-all, this is their first game, and we had Xmas holidays before, so we won't likely watch a very consistent match anyway. If the values won't move, we're more oriented in attempting a Low bet on Splyce, in order to take advantage of the more rewarding odds, but ultimately we wouldn't be surprised to watch this game simply finishing in a Tie.

However, we need to remember that most of the EU teams are still sitting in a post-holiday Limbo, and understandably most lineups didn't really begin their practice schedule yet. So for the first couple of weeks we will very likely see a fair amount of inconsistent results and kinda random upsets. Obviously EnVyUs have a clear advantage over Dignitas due the higher skill-ceiling. But overall, they ended the 2015 kinda sloppy, compared to most of the other top-tier teams. Basically lacking top-notch finishes since early November, when they managed to take home the DH Cluj-Napoca trophy. On the other hand Dignitas aren't on a very consistent streak either, and even though they played decently their most recent matches, those prior the Xmas break. Previously the Danish side experienced a quite a bit of serious issues when dealing with Tier1 opponents, and they rarely managed to impress in games above T2. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_mirage, de_cbble and de_train. If the veto will go so, the French side should have an edge on both Mirage and Cobblestone, while we wouldn't be surprised to see Dignitas taking Train. Betting odds are currently pretty skewed in favor of EnVyUs, and this is actually correct since the Frenchmen are surely a step ahead Dignitas. However, since we're talking about one of the very first matches of the year, we wouldn't be surprised to see a final score slightly closer than expected. Anyway, the current percentages are still decent for going Low+ on Envy, but we suggest to wait a bit before placing your bet and eventually go for an ICB on Dignitas, if the Odds will drop below the 20% threshold (for Dig).

Certainly not as exciting as the show we just saw finish up in Vegas, but may potentially be a bit of a fairly balanced match-up, so we're hopeful for something entertaining to end the day. SPLYCE as we've touched on underwent a full overhaul during the holiday break, now composed of the former 3sUP lineup. They looked decent in first match under the new banner in draw versus WinterFox. Prior to that, as 3sUP, they didn't have some their best stuff going, so the a fresh start with new organization may be good for them. Meanwhile, trying gain some traction in Tier3, SKDC is just gaining experience, and surely didn't finish 2015 as they hoped, as far as matches against relevant teams. So they'll likely be eager to begin the year with a splash as well. After all, we're coming out the holiday break and NA shuffle, and they're amongst some of the few to remain the same, which is worth noting. Betting odds are well skewed in favor of SPLYCE, which is to be expected considering the experience advantage they hold. On our end, we're in agreement here, and don't see SPLYCE losing more than 1 map. But these percentages aren't really rewarding enough, so we'd suggest considering a skip. If you want to pick though, Low on SPLYCE is the way to go
http://csgo.guru/match/3328!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7617!$QM!$Penta!$QM!$0.8!$0.93!$-0.13!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Honestly not very much to say, this is the very first match of the year for the ex-TSM squad, which we rebranded into TQM in order to comply with their decision to move out from the American organization. Even if the post-holiday days are generally a bit inconsistent, we're not expecting huge surprises, and the Danish side shouldn't face any huge issue in rolling over Penta in a Bo3 match. In particular now that the German squad suffered of 2 relevant losses (both Spiidi and Strux1 left the roster), and actually is playing with a couple of stand-ins. Betting odds are currently widely skewed in favor of TSM, and we agree on this, however as usual when we talk about 90/10 matches we don't really suggest to waste time in betting when the reward is so low, and you should consider a plain skip. If you want to pick a side anyway, obviously TQM is the way to go.

Yesterday ex-TSM provided a quite convincingly performance against Penta, and they didn't sweat too much in rolling over the German-mix with a quick 2-0 sweep. Right now there isn't much to say about the Danes, since they took a pretty long Xmas break, and this is still one of their very first games. On the other hand, Vexed played a bit more in the short-term, even if they mostly faced kinda low-end teams, and then their current streak isn't extremely relevant, however worth mentioning that the Poles are a weird team, and they frequently step-up a lot against top-tier opponents, compared to their average performances. Current betting odds are basically trash, and with values floating around 90/10 we cannot really suggest to go with ex-TSM, so we highly suggest to evaluate a skip, but if you really want to pick a side anyway, going with an ICB on Vexed could be an option (risky, but at least more fun than going all-in on TQM and winning a couple of cents).

As we already mentioned in the past days, Penta lost 2/5 of their roster during the Xmas shuffle, and actually they are fielding stand-ins in order to fill the 2 empty spots, so from the Germans we're not expecting to see anything more complex than a pug-like gameplay. On the other hand unuAiN are slightly more structured, and even if the current roster faced a serious face lift compared to the previous iteration (the Hunden team played as Reason in fall 2015) we're prone in believing that the Danish side could be capable to setup a slightly more consistent show. Betting odds aren't really great right now, and the game it self is going to be quite random due the kinda messy lineups, so we don't really suggest to throw high values on this match, however if you're feeling lucky and you want to risk a bit on a low-tier game, our pick is a Low bet on unuAiN.

However, since the previous game just finished and the current one is scheduled to start in mins, so we've to be slightly shorter than usual. Overall Dignitas looked slightly more solid compared to HellRaisers and they moved through the bracket in relative ease, while HR had to deal with a tough fight against E-Frag, and only on map3 they managed to close the match. As we stated several times already, the Danes didn't experience any major lineup change during the Xmas shuffle, and the Rubino addition is already consolidated, while on the other hand HellRaisers are still messing with their roster, and the 5th player isn't really final yet. Betting odds are skewed in favor of Dignitas, and we agree on this vision, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on them as well.

Dignitas began their 2016 with a 2-0 loss against EnVyUs, and today they'll meet the Frenchmen one more time, but honestly we don't really believe we'll watch the Danes taking home more than a map, according to the fact that they always struggled a lot in countering Tier1 opponents. However we need to say that they are coming from a couple of convincingly shows, and in the past days they rolled over HR and unu.AiN in relative ease. On the other hand, In January EnVyUs basically played just a single official match (the one against Dignitas), and overall we're prone in believing that this might cause them some early struggles in Map1, since they are facing a roster that generally played more and moved back from Xmas holidays slightly early. About maps, there are good chances to watch: de_mirage, de_cbble and de_train. If the veto will go so, Dignitas may have some chances on Train, but Mirage and Cobblestone should be in clear favor of Envy. Betting odds are pretty bad, and not really profitable, but we're oriented in playing safe and go for an Avg bet on EnVyUs. Even if we suggest to keep a close eye on percentages, and just skip if the values will move to 90/10.

The ex-TSM roster is moving here after a couple of quite easy games against Vexed and Penta, and overall the Danes are looking quite revitalized from the Xmas break, additionally seems that they finally managed to find a new Organization (not officially announced yet, but here is our guess), so we're pretty sure that their moral is back to good levels too. On the other hand, there isn't much to say about Titan and actually they are a quite big 'Question Mark', they had a month-long break and they didn't play any official match in 2016 yet, so guessing their current form is basically impossible, however we don't have huge hopes, and overall ex-TSM are looking more solid. About maps, we're expecting to watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, Dust2 and Inferno could be balanced picks, while Overpass should be in favor of TQM. Overall betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on TQM, and we're oriented in taking this path as well. However we wouldn't be surprised to watch Titan coming back from the hell and setting up a decent fight, so think twice before picking High values.

Luminosity are moving here after a victory at the MAX5 Invitational, a local Brazilian LAN they used as 'warm-up' for waking up from the Xmas laziness. Even if the event it self wasn't really relevant from an International point of view, we cannot deny the training value, and actually LG are the side that are entering the SLTV Finals with the highest amount of matches played across the last 2 weeks. On the other hand Gamers2 aren't really easy to 'read', in the new year they played just a couple of games, the first of whom against Dignitas, where they performed pretty badly and lost by measure with a quick 2-0 sweep delivered by the Danes. The following one, against Alternate, isn't really relevant since the German side is still far away from the Tier2/3 level, so we weren't really expecting anything different from a victory. Worth noting that G2 experienced some kind of issues in travelling to the SLTV Finals venue, and some players managed to arrive just this morning, however we don't believe that this will affect them too much, in particular since this game will be very likely pushed ahead of 2h or so due the delays accumulated by the previous game. About maps, we believe we'll watch de_overpass, de_train and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, Overpass should be in favor of LG, while Inferno will likely go to G2, and Train is going to be pretty balanced. Betting odds are still quite even, but at our end we're oriented in picking Luminosity thanks to their more solid training during the entry part of the year. Anyway, we'll likely watch the game hitting all the 3 maps, so we suggest to stay Low in value.

EnVyUs are moving here foloowing a rather shocking defeat against ex-TSM in the RED DOT Invitational Grand-Final. Honestly, we were expecting to watch a pretty balanced game, even the Veto went decently, but something crashed in the Envy's teamplay. They basically failed to put up any resistance, and allowed the Danes to seal an easy victory to take the trophy with a clean 2-0 sweep. Overall the Frenchmen are looking a bit out of form, they haven't played much in the past month. Additionally their loss against TQM underlined a critical lack of creativity, that resulted in doing the same things over and over, despite the lack of positive results. On the other hand Fnatic haven't played since the ESL/ESEA Finals, so a pretty long while, basically a month. Taking this into consideration, evaluating their current status is pretty hard. Surely they ended the year in the best possible way, but right now we don't have a real clue about their form, so they're one of the biggest question mark of the event. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_cbble, de_inferno and de_cache. If this is how the veto goes, Cobblestone is kinda 50/50, while Fnatic should have an edge on Inferno, and EnVyUs will likely take Cache ('maybe' they didn't want to spoil it @ Red Dot in order to save strats for SLTV?). Betting odds are currently quite skewed in favor of Fnatic, and without a doubt, they are quite favored for the final victory as well. But honestly, the real-world odds are quite close, and since we're talking about a LAN match, we wouldn't be surprised to watch EnVyUs getting back on track, so at our end we're oriented in playing the percentages with a Low bet on Envy.
http://csgo.guru/match/3356!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7693!$Titan!$QM!$QM!$0.42!$0.24!$0.18!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Extremely interesting game, and mostly a rematch of the RED DOT Semi-Final. In that game Titan managed to setup a great fight, forcing ex-TSM to map3, after the two entry maps ended in Overtime. Later in the Semi, TQM finally flexed their muscles, and managed to take home a victory over Titan and in the Grand-Final as well, in a super-convincing show against EnVyUs,(who, on the other hand, provided a kinda poor fight. Overall, ex-TSM hasn't played too much over the short-term, much like most of the other top-tier teams attending SLTV Finals. But based on what we've watched so far, they aren't looking too bad. Plus, on Lan, without weird connection issues, they should be able to unload their full potential. A couple of days ago Titan put up a top-notch fight against the Danes, however they are kind of a momentum based team, and on Lan they've all too frequently had to pack their bags early, despite their top-tier roster. We're kinda unsure about their current form, and we feel a bit weird in basing our prediction on just a single match, particularly when in Fall 2015, they didn't deliver anything consistent. About the Veto, we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. Which on paper is an extremely balanced mix of maps. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of ex-TSM, while real-world percentages are more aligned to 58-42 in favor of the Danes. According to the actual values, we don't feel comfortable in going Average on TQM, but we're more oriented in trying our luck with an ICB on Titan, with the hope to watch the Frenchmen setting up a show aligned with the Red Dot one.

However, Device and friends had to fight way harder than expected in order to dismiss the French side, and the first two maps finished in OT (1st one in favor of TQM &amp; the 2nd to the Frenchmen), with Titan bringing up one of their AAA games (something we haven't seen in a while), and ex-TSM forced to provide a top-notch show on Dust2. A map where Titan has always been quite tricky. Its worth noting that TQM had to deal with connection issues and high-latency during a good part of the evening. So this surely affected their performance, and without a doubt it will keep creating troubles for the Danes in this current game too. On the other hand, EnVyUs didn't show any real flaws against Dignitas, and they rolled over them in a clean 2-0 sweep. The kind of show we're quite used to seeing from them since the Nordic team always displayed serious limits in battling Tier1 opponents. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_inferno, de_mirage and de_cache. If the veto goes this way, Inferno should be quite balanced, while Mirage is going to be mostly random (since both teams never really excelled on it), and Cache should be in favor of the French side. At our end, after watching all the struggles that ex-TSM experienced against Titan, we're prone to picking a Low bet on EnVyUs, and the current betting odds are still decent for taking this path as well.

SK are moving here well warmed up by their previous game against LDLC White, and as we already mentioned in our prediction for that match, the Danish side is actually experiencing a pretty strong momentum, and without doubts they are one of the teams to monitor during this first part of the year. On the other hand, Mousesports didn't play in a while, and this is their first real game after the Xmas holidays. They closed the year with a loss in the 'Road to Vegas' Qualifier, but we don't suggest to take that game as relevant, since most of the high-tier teams ended it in a similar way, and honestly most of the players were mostly looking forward to the upcoming break, rather than put effort in qualify for an early January showmatch (however this is a kinda questionable choice, since the Vegas game also awarded an ELeague spot). However, worth remembering that the German side switched Spiidi for Gob B in late December, in this way they reformed the duo (Nex - Spiidi) that did really well during Q2-3 2015 (but obviously this move also decreased the tactical capability of the roster, since Gob B used to be the mastermind). About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, Mouz should have an edge on Inferno, while SK will likely grab Train. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of SK due all the hype on their latest performances, while at our end we believe we'll watch a pretty balanced game, so our pick is a Low bet on Mousesports in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages, but overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch a plain Tie due the Bo2 format.

On the other hand, SK regained their form, and played a pretty exciting fall 2015 together with a promising January, as plus they also moved through the Xmas shuffle without changes, so we don't believe they'll face huge issues in rolling over the French/Belgian side. As already mentioned, percentages are already no-sense, so betting here is mostly a waste of time, but overall SK should be able to take it home or at least hit a Tie.

The GamShow GEC moves into the Quarter Finals for the NA Region, where two teams who survived the NA Shuffle will faceoff. Winterfox has looked have finally been on an upswing, offering more consistent performances in the their more recent matches. Although a majority of their contests have been with non-ranked opponents. But its worth noting, thats these are games they should winning, earning them the top seed in Group A. Winning their upper-bracket games vs SPLYCE and JMF landed Wfx in this Quarter Final. Enemy on the other hand, kept their spot in this tournament alive through two lower-bracket sweeps. They also made a push in Road2Vegas with wins over C9 and SPLYCE, but Optic was too much to handle. Relyks and friends are also performing with a somewhat improved consistency like their opponents, so this should make for a decent battle today. As for today's match, these two are moderately acquainted, and have had a few spirited contests in the last Quarter. Though Enemy holds the advantage in the head to head matchup, their most recent duels have been mostly even, and even required OT in their last bout. We need to note, that NME will be playing with a stand-in today, so this should be a more even balanced contest that could go either way. Betting Odds are pretty skewed in favor of NME, which we agree with. So our pick is a Low Bet on Enemy. But if percentages reach the ICB threshold (20/80), then we'd consider an ICB on Wfx instead.

Plus we currently find them both playing kinda inconsistent and not too reliable. However, this is a Bo2 match, and generally when two teams with similar issues meet, we typically see an outcome of a plain Tie. Anyway, about Vexed, we just want to remember that they generally step-up a bit when facing decent opponents, so we wouldn't be surprised to see the Polish side playing properly. Even though they aren't really solid on the extended map-pool yet. On the other hand, FlipSid3 are surely a step ahead skill-wise. But lately their gameplay is overly messy, and not really as sharp as they used to be in the past Quarters. Basically, without DavCost, their executions have turned a bit slow and predictable, when they previously had a good set of maps where they were able to setup quite great fights. Betting odds are slightly skewed in favor of Fsid3, but still decent for going Low on them, so we're oriented in sticking with Markeloff and friends for our pick.

The GSG Cup is nearing it's conclusion, with this contest determining the second team from the NA region to join CLG in Vilnius for the LAN-final with its $200K prizepool. Cloud9 are mostly among the teams to have been on a month-long break during the holiday break. And considering the lack of form they showed prior to the break, during teir 0-2 defeat versus Enemy in the Road2Vegas qualifier, the current expectation of C9 is certainly questionable. This was a bit surprising, considering the strong push in the final quarter of the year, taking the prize at IBP and RGN. C9 did however play a partial match for the Quarter-Final vs JMF but a streaming violation resulted in a team ban mid-game, and C9 was awarded the win, despite a not so great Cobblestone. Winterfox on the other hand, survived the NA suffle in tact through the break, and have overall been playing better recently, and already have a few games (2-0-1) under their belt in the new year. They coming off a strong performance against Enemy last night, in 3 map battle, that saw Wfx earn their spot here today. As for this match, this may be much closer than expected on first glance. We're seeing the Betting Odds skewed well in favor of Cloud9, which is to be expected with T1 vs T3 matchup. But real-world odds are much closer to even, but still in favor of Skadoodle and friends. Especially since Stewie2k's replacement of seang@res lineup change hasn't seen too many contests yet, so teamplay has a higher potential for issues. As for the Veto, we expect to see de_overpass, de_cache, and de_dust2. And overall, C9 is advantaged throughout the map-pool. But the best chances for Wfx to manage an upset will be on Overpass and Cache. With these percentages, a C9 pick isn't really rewarding, so we'd suggest evaluating a skip. But the randomness of early year competition may warrant an ICB on the more practiced Winterfox squad.

Luminosity managed to grab a pretty impressive victory over Gamers2 in their SLTV Finals entry game. The Brazilian side looked a good step ahead of G2 throughout the whole match, and they displayed some strong confidence, even on a tricky map such as Train. LG already faced Natus Vincere in December, during the ESL/ESEA Finals, and in that occasion we enjoyed a pretty tight game that ended on map3. This time there are good chances to watch an even closer game, considering the form displayed by Luminosity looks kinda high. On the other hand, Natus Vincere took down the Chinese side CyberZen without sweating much, but prior this game the CIS mix didn't really play any other contests, and just like Fnatic, they are moving here after a month-long break. So honestly we've doubts about their current form as well. Talking about maps, we believe we'll watch: de_overpass, de_train and de_cbble. If the veto goes so, Cobblestone should be in favor of NaVi, while LG will likely grab Train leaving Overpass which may go both ways. Betting odds are skewed in favor of NaVi, but after the performance that LG managed to set up we believe that real-world percentages are moreso balanced, so we're oriented in risking a bit and going for a Low bet on Luminosity.

Day 2 is primarily Group B play, but we do have the Group A decider match for the Quarter-Final. Natus Vincere handled CyberZen in their entry game as easily as expected 2-0. However, in the winner's match, they weren't prepared for what the Brazilians had to offer. Train was very close, but lead by coldzera LG managed to close it out. Mirage was fairly tight in the 1st half, but LG took over from there to complete the sweep. Although our pick was LG, we were surprised NaVi didn't take even a single map. So they're sure to bring it here, in order to stave off elimination. Meanwhile, Gamers2 got handled by the Brazilians in their entry game is surprisingly easy fashion, also in 2-0 sweep. That match was over before G2 knew what hit em. And in their elimination match against the Chinese, G2 continued the sweat as they found themselves quickly down after Inferno. But they fought their way back, and managed eek through the next two maps to survive another day. As for this deciding contest, these two haven't faced each other in over 5 months, when G2 was under the Kinguin banner. Those matches were mostly dominated by G2, but honestly, that was too long ago to reference for today's game. We're certainly expecting to see Guardian and co. bring it, and considering the lackluster effort from G2 so far, we don't believe that NaVi will have huge troubles reaching the Quarter Finals. Bettings Odds are trending in favor of NaVi, but we'd suggest waiting closer to the match before making a pick and wait out the percenatges. Assuming the percentages stay below the 80/20 range, we're confident in watching NaVi take the match so they're our pick for a Low+ Bet.

So we're not expecting a level of compete from NiP near what we're typically used to. This lineup change will likely have a considerable impact, considering difference in playstyle between the two. But the Bulgarians should make for a good opponent for them start out against following the change. As for E-frag, they've had a busy start the new year, (with the same roster as before the break). In those 3 contests, they swept both games 2-0 vs subT3 teams, but in their only relevant contest with HellRaisers, the they lost their momentum on the extended map-pool. So that will likely be a challenge for them as well today. This is actually the first time we've got to watch these two battle it out, so it could make for an interesting matchup. We're currently watching the Betting Odds most already trashed in favor on NiP, which is to be expected. But with the variable of the lineup change for the Swedes, Real-World Odds are 62/38. Surely not a evenly balanced, but theres a good possibility of watching go to the 3rd map. But we really would be surprised if NiP lose more than 1 map, so if you gotta pick, NiP are our pick for an Avg bet, but with these percentages, you may want to consider a skip instead.

With the exception of one lineup change, just PAINT instead of Slap. In the past few weeks, the former LC roster looked like one of the more promising 'Challenger' teams. They delivered solid teamplay with a bunch of fairly decent games, where overall they performed even better than a good mount of mid-ranked Tier3 teams. This is the 2nd game in a row for FlipSid3, so they should move here already well warmed up. As we already stated in the previous match, the Ukrainian roster started having some issues after the departure of DavCost. They are actually a pretty momentum-based and kinda random group, even on maps where they used to be solid. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of FSid3, and this is expected due to PANTERS being still pretty young. But since we're talking about just another Bo2 game, we wouldn't be surprised to see the Norwegians do well, and should be fully capable of taking home a map. So since the percentages are too off for our taste, we're more prone in picking a Low bet on ex-LC.

Both teams are moving here after convincingly victories over Fnatic and Titan. As usual ex-TSM struggled a bit in dismissing the Frenchmen, but at least this time they managed to avoid nasty Overtimes and map3. On the other hand EnVyUs delivered an absolutely top-notch show against JW &amp; friends, and looks like that the French side didn't unfold all their cards during the Red Dot Finals, where they lost by measure against ex-TSM, however now they have a good chance to take their revenge. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_inferno, de_cache and de_mirage. If the veto will go so, the map-pool looks quite balanced, and both rosters should be able to deal with it in a kinda even way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Envy, but honestly this is a pure 50/50 match-up, so at our end we're oriented in taking advantage of the percentages and go for a Low pick on ex-TSM.

Well, not much to say about Titan, honestly we were expecting a bit more from them, in particular after the good things they managed to setup during the Red Dot Semi-Final, however we're oriented in believing that their mood actually isn't the very best, since Titan (as org.) just announced their disbandment. On the other hand, Fnatic moved to SLTV Finals after a month-long break, and they clearly paid it to EnVyUs, basically failing to put up any decent show in both maps. Overall they looked kinda rusty, but we'll probably watch them coming back against the French/Belgian side. About maps, our picks are: de_cbble, de_train and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, Fnatic should have an edge on Cobblestone and Inferno, while we wouldn't be surprised to watch Titan taking Train. Betting odds are still decent for a Low pick on Fnatic, so we're oriented in taking this path as well, since we believe that the Swedes will wake up a bit.

Fnatic moved here after rolling over ex-Titan in a 3-maps contest. But honestly, with slightly more effort they could have closed it with a plain 2-0 sweep. However, the Swedes looked a bit more in form compared with their kinda disappointing entry game, and now they'll meet TQM well warmed up, and ready to provide their very best. On the other hand ex-TSM played a bit short of our expectations. Versus EnVyUs they made surplus of mistakes, especially late in the game, where most of their strats were too predictable and not at all on point to what they used to be. We'll see if they can wake up a bit, and come prepared in this game. About the maps, theres good chances of watching: de_inferno, de_dust2 and de_mirage. If this is how the veto goes, Dust2 should in favor of TQM, while Inferno may go to Fnatic, leaving Mirage as the most balanced map of the group. Betting odds are still floating around the middle, but at our end we're slightly more prone in picking Fnatic, since we rarely watched the Swedes choke in crucial games.

Natus Vincere are moving here after a quick game against CyberZen, a pretty impressive fail versus the Brazilian side Luminosity, and quite an exciting match-up where they faced Gamers2. Overall they looked pretty solid, and as team they've placed much interest in TV, and so we believe they'll approach this match pretty pumped-up. However we have to note, based on what we've seen so far, their executions have looked a bit shaky mid-game, and we've the feeling that some players, such as Edward aren't fully understanding their role. On the other hand ex-TSM, with the exclusion of the entry game, where they dismissed Titan, failed to put up a fight on par with the rest of the top-teams. They definitely lost their face-off with EnVyUs in a kinda dumb way, while against Fnatic we were expecting a muchbetter show on Inferno. A map where they generally always put up stronger fights. As for the maps, we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_mirage. Should the veto go this way, Mirage should be in favor of NaVi, while TQM will likely grab Overpass, and Dust2 is going to be mostly random. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of ex-TSM, but honestly we're talking about a rather balanced game. So on our end, we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Natus Vincere, mostly just to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

The first Quarter-Final to kick off today's games isn't really the most balanced matchup, but this event has featured some closely fought contests, so optimistically we'll look forward to more of the same. Gamers2 are surely the underdogs of the remaining contenders, and they've had a pretty rough road here thus far. LG basically steamrolled over G2 in the entry game, and then the Europeans managed to barely escape early elimination against the Chinese. Day 2 was a bit more encouraging as far as their compete level went, but they just couldn't top NaVi. But its worth noting, despite the 0-2 sweep, NaVi did have to work for it, with G2 forcing OT on Dust2, and narrowly lost at Train 14-16. And now they're going to need to flawless performance if they hope to reach the semis. Fnatic on the hand, is the second seed from Group B due to their entry game loss vs NV, where the holiday break rust was quite evident as Frenchmen made quick work of the Swedes. After shaking the cobwebs, Krimz and co. get back on track with consecutive 2-1 wins over ex-Titan and TQM. So by the conclusion of Day 2, Fnatic appear to be closer to their true form. As for this matchup, G2 is simply going to have their hands full. As stated above, they're gonna need perfect execution for advancing on to be a possiblity. But honestly, G2 is still a solid T2 team, and essentially outmatched by the Swedish. We have seen crazier things happen in the past, but Fnatic also seems to pull through once the stakes go up. So we're don't expect them to have too much issue in moving on in the tournament. As for the maps, we believe we see de_inferno, de_cache, and de_mirage following the veto. But overall, Fnatic is pretty much advantaged throughout the map-pool. G2's best chance for make this interesting to jump ahead on Inferno, where they've typically shown some of the better stuff. But our expectations are mostly on par with the current Betting Odds, foreshadowing a lopsided victory for Olofmeister and gang. We hate to suggest a skip in the Quarter finals, but we're not confident enough to yolo ICB, so if you gotta pick, an Avg Bet on Fnatic.

Luminosity are heading into this game with two significant victories already in the bag. On Day 1, they managed to roll over Natus Vincere and Gamers2 with relative ease, dismissing both rosters with 2-0 sweeps. The Brazilians looked extremely in form so far, and we're sure the local event they played prior to moving to SLTV Finals helped them in rebuilding their momentum quickly, while most of the other high-tiered teams ended up struggling in their entry games, still encumbered from the Xmas break laziness. On the other hand, Fnatic had a slightly colder start than expected, but as soon as they managed to break free of the rust, they quicly returned their typical high level. Prior to entering this match they totally destroyed G2, and that followed couple of 2-1 victories against ex-TSM and Titan. So we're sure they'll approach this game with a form significantly higher than what they displayed against EnVyUs. About the maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_train, de_inferno and de_dust2. If the veto goes this way, Train and Inferno should be mostly balanced picks, while Dust2 is probably in favor of the Swedes. Betting odds are overly skewed in favor of Fnatic, who are unquestionably more consistent than LG, particularly on the extended map-pool. Honestly, 20/80 percentages when we're talking about a Semi-Final when the Brazilians displayed such amazing performances so far this event is pretty much nonsense. So we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB on Luminosity.

EnvyUs got to enjoy a day off while the Quarter Finals were sorting out, due to their near perfect showing in Group B, cementing their position in the semis. The French must've been a little sore from their disappointing outing at Red Dot, cause they swept Fnatic in their entry game as if the Swedes were a 'challenger' team. And then followed up that performance with another strong showing versus ex-TSM, which was surely a confidence building win since it were the Danes who topped them at Red Dot. Now they'll need to top another elite team once more in order to reach the grand finals. While the French were relaxing as spectators for the Quarter Finals, Natus Vincere had their work cut out for them to keep their hopes alive in the competition. Follwing their entry game win over CyberZen, NaVi was blindsided by a well-prepared LG in the winner's match which should've been a wake-up call for Guardian and co. But G2 was closer than expected contest, despite the sweep, however NaVi finally appeared closer to their true form vs TQM. It wasn't the best we've seen from TQM, but NaVi was sure to take advantage of every mistake the Dannish made, earning their spot amongst the final four. As for this game, no doubt quite the exciting matchup, and one we've been able to enjoy quite often recently. Historically, these two never fail at putting up a great shows, and based on those battles we believe we watch de_dust2, de_cbble, and de_mirage. Throughout the map-pool, these two are quite evenly balanced. Assuming the veto goes this way, NaVi is slightly favored on Dust2, while NV is slightly advantaged on Cobblestone, leaving Mirage which could go either way. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor EnvyUs, but real-world Odds are pretty much 50/50. Granted, NaVi hasn't really played to their full potential yet this week, while NV has looked convincing during their track to the semis. Over their recent bouts, NaVi has actually had the upper hand. Furthermore, their form and executions improved exponentially throughout the tournament, looking stonger with each match. Not to mention the possibility of the Frenchmen have lost a little momentum with the off day. So once again, on our end, we more oriented in playing the percentages and chasing the more rewarding Low Bet on NaVi.

Fresh off their recent victory in Vegas, awarding them a spot in the upcoming first season of E-League, the players of the former banner Conquest, have embarked into 2016 with their new organization OpTic. And as we've mentioned numerous times in the last quarter of '15, this Canadian crew is a team we've been quite excited about and have enjoyed watching their ascent into the international pro scene. And honestly, they're poised to be amongst the hottest teams in NA, with extreme promise for making their mark in 2016. This will be OpTic's second contest of the year. The first being their 2-0 sweep of CSGL at Road2Vegas, where they demonstrated a high level of resolve and resilience after falling behind earlier versus the Polish, closing the the second half 11-3 to win the map. Then dominat ed on Cobblestone to complete the sweep, taking the $35K prize. An impressive start as OpTic Gaming. Winterfox on the other hand, were a struggling T3 team, who eventually started to find solid ground as the year came to close following the roster move to NA. Overall, they seem to have found some of level of consistency and improved teamplay, before and after the holiday break. So they too have offered some encouraging things for the year ahead. As for this match, we're only talking about bo1, so the randomness variable is certainly something to consider. At this point, Wfx is still a step behind OpTic, however, the bo1 surely evens the playing field some since OpTic's style favors momentum heavily, which benefits more on the extended map-pool. But as we saw vs CSGL, Stanislaw and friends were able to crawl back from an early deficit. So on our end, we're mostly aligned with the current Betting Odds for a Low Bet on OpTic as our pick while the percentages still remain rewarding enough to do so. But as a bo1, you may want to consider a skip if they pass the 80/20 threshold.

In that Final, Fnatic managed to finish off Natus Vincere with a 3-2 score, after an extremely tight Bo5 where both sides played stellar. This time they have to mess with just a Bo3, but based on what we've seen so far, and the performances these rosters delivered late in 2015, we believe we can look forward again to a pretty balanced game, with real-world odds floating around 50/50. NAVI has impressed us a lot, with a show against EnVyUs in the Semis that was just mind blowing. They basically steam rolled the Frenchmen and controlled the whole game without sweating too much. On the other hand Fnatic didn't experience as easiy of a journey. Versus Luminosity they risked a lot, making only a couple of tiny mistakes preventing LG from reaching the Grand-Final instead of the Swedes. Surely Fnatic are extremely solid, and their knowledge on the extended map-pool is great, but if GuardiaN and friends keep playing as they did during the past few days, JW and co. will have to provide more than their very best in order to grab the trophy. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_inferno, de_dust2 and de_mirage. If the veto goes this way, Inferno should be in favor of Fnatic, while Mirage should go to NAVI, and Dust2 is going to be pretty random. Betting odds are currently sitting around 60/40 in favor of the Swedish side, but as we mentioned above the real-odds are pretty equal. We're expecting a match that will hit all the 3 maps, so at our end we're slightly more prone toward taking advantage of the slightly higher reward and go for a Low bet on NAVI.

As mentioned with the other match, the remaining four were the expected contenders as the only ranked teams. OpTic is surely the favorite, and really shouldn't have too much trouble handling this match, particularly with Bo3 format. They've banked a considerable amount of LAN experience in the last few months, and should feel right at home for the event's final day. Meanwhile SPLYCE is entering this match after rather easy sweep of L1 in their decider match, after losing to them in their entry game. The decider match, to their credit, was the best show they've offered in this weekend, so perhaps they fould a little momentum going into this contest. But even that may not be enough to hang against the Canadians who've been playing exceptionally well. Betting Odds are already trashed in favor OpTic, which we were in agreement with. If SPLYCE is starting to click as a team, they be able to force this to the 3rd map. But honestly, we can't see OpTic failing more than once, based on what they've shown lately. So on our end, this is definitely worth skipping, but if you gotta pick, Avg on OpTic.

WinterFox is moving here after a default win, a loss against OpTiC and an extremely tight victory over Obey, overall they aren't looking stellar and their latest online shows were surely more promising compared to what they are displaying on LAN. On the other hand Enemy had a slightly more interesting journey, since they won by measure their two entry games, and moved forward in a solid fashion, however worth noting that they didn't mess with relevant lineups yet, so their victories aren't extremely relevant. Anyway, they surely have a slightly more structured gameplay compared to WinterFox. About maps, we're expecting to see de_cache, de_inferno and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, Enemy should have an edge on Cache, while Wfox will likely grab Inferno, and Cobblestone is going to be pretty random. Current betting odds are still balanced, so at our end we're oriented in picking a Low bet on Enemy, mostly because we find WinterFox kinda inconsistent and too prone in 'random tilting'.

As said, little time between matches, so we'll get right to it. Enemy looked both steady and strong in their semi-final against Winterfox, where they managed to pull the ez 2-0 sweep. They proved to be at this point the most consistent of the teams, as they remained unbeaten through the tournament. Meanwhile SPLYCE are surely the unexpected second contender of the final, arriving here after a very impressive showing over the Minor favorite OpTic. Theres no question this crew is very emotion-based, which played in the favor as they gained steam in semi final. By the 2nd half of the 3rd map, SPLYCE honestly took over taking full control of the match, to which OpTic had no answer. To their credit, a very impressive showing. As for this match, NME is entering as the favored, which we're inclined to agree. Betting Odds are trending in their favor as well, but after the fight SPLYCE put up to defeat OpTic, we're slightly more oriented in risking a Low Bet on their momentum and go for the higher reward. So they're our pick for the risky upset as the underdog.

FlipSid3 are moving here after a couple of quite disappointing shows. Without a doubt, over the short-term, (after the departure of DavCost) their gameplay suffered, and even strats-wise they're not really as solid as they used to be. However, historically they've always managed to counter E-Frag pretty well. And they rolled over them on basically every occasion. On the other hand, the Bulgarians are stepping into this game with a quite decent winning streak in their corner, together with a couple of good shows against NiP &amp; HR. Surely they're a tricky team to face, but winning a Bo2 is always a difficult task, so we don't believe they'll grab more than a map. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of E-Frag, but at our end we're prone in considering this game as a 50/50 one, and we it find more worthwhile going Low on FlipSid3 in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

Vexed are generally a kinda inconsistent roster, but in January they have already accumulated a reasonable set of results. Overall, they didn't do too bad, but guessing how they'll play isn't too easy, nor do we think they're able to deliver a 2-0 sweep. We already discussed E-Frag in their previous game, and even if they've lately put up decent contests against high-tiered teams, together with several victories over unranked/challenger ones, we still find them still a bit unreliable, particularly in messy mid-tier games. Betting odds are trending in favor of the Bulgarian side, and even if they may have a little edge, percentages around 30/70 are surely too skewed. We wouldn't be surprised to watch the Poles do well, so our pick is a Low bet on Vexed.

This will be the second contest of the year for CSGL, and their first appearance since the disappointing showing in Vegas vs OpTic. So its a little difficult to guess what to expect from them, considering how much downtime they've had in the past few weeks. Meanwhile Dignitas have been nothing but busy in the near year. Their highest level match against NV at Red Dot however, was the low point of the new for the Danes. Aside from that though, they been playing with relatively strong form. And have high chances of exacting some revenge for being eliminated from the E-League qualifier by the Poles, last month. As for this match, the Danish side have the great benefit of being in some rhythm of competition. And that will likely pay dividends in the first half of the contest. Following the Veto, there are good chances of seeing de_train, de_cache, and de_overpass. Should the veto go this way, Cache will favor the Danes, while the Polish will be advantaged on Overpass, leaving Train as mostly a toss up. Betting Odds are skewed in favor of the Danes, and considering the above mentioned variables, this trend is correct. However we do need to point out again, that the Polish side managed to take 2/3 in their last meet, contributing towards real world odds at 40/60. On our end, we're oriented in going with Average Bet on Dignitas, mostly because their strong momentum.

ALTERNATE aTTax has a new squad whose played just a few official games, and in their relevant matches versus G2 and Mouz they got swept 0-2 and managed a draw, respectively. It's a fresh lineup that hasn't yet had much experience on the "international playground", but one we'll be keeping an eye on. On the other hand, SK comes to this appointment with a relatively consistent streak of good results, particularly in victories against Flipsid3 and Vexed. But recently stumbled against Mouz in APM contest they were surprisingly swept. So we're expecting a turnaround here, where the Danes look to get back on track. Betting odds are completely is favor of SK, and this is the mostly obvious pick, especially when the extended map-pool is feature. So our pick is an Average bet on the Danes.

Gamers2 are coming here after a disappointing appearance in the SLI Starseries XIV, where they lost all of their matches, except a very close battle against CyberZen. Maybe their morale is not currently at the highest level, but this lineup is made ​​up of well-seasoned players, with the experience to grind out of a slump. Meanwhile FlipSid3 also began the new year with some inconsistency. They put a couple negative performances, particularly with SK and Vexed. But rebounded with an impressive sweep vs E-frag and an ex-LC draw. They are certainly affected by the DavCost departure, and the team's gameplay may need some time to adjust. Betting odds are trending in favor of G2, but with Flipsid3 being capable of taking a map, we're more than likely to see another tie. The BO2 format is always something tricky to achieve victory. But on our end, we believe G2 has better chances of winning both maps than the Ukrainians, so G2 is our pick for a Low Bet.

FlipSid3 are currently on a pretty good streak, and somehow managed to recover quite well from the departure of DavCost. Surely they still have margin of improvement to recover still, particularly since they really didn't face any top-tier team yet. Their yesterday victory over Gamers2 isn't really relevant since G2 didn't even try to put up a fight, and then withdrew from the whole APM cup just a couple of hours later. (Rumors here are that they are actually moving to Faze). On the other hand, the latest iteration of the Penta lineup, now featuring an EU roster is still kinda 'off' and not quite ready to deal with most established teams yet. Surely they did decently in the German scene, but the previous roster was without a doubt a step ahead and way more experienced on the International field. Betting odds are still quite ok for going with Fsid3, so we don't see any reason against going Low+ on them, since we don't believe we'll watch Markeloff and friends lose 2 maps in a row. (It's a Bo2, so in the worst case we should see a tie).

Natus Vincere with their solid teamplay arive here following a very strong perfomance in the Starseries Finals, where mostly devestated the field of G2, Atralis (ex-TQM), and EnvyUs to reach the Grand-Final, but again fell short against Fnatic. On the other hand, (David in this analogy) SK surely doesn't intend to just lay down for NaVi. The Danish side have been playing decently in the short-term, stringing together some good results in wins over a few T3 and below opponenets, and a 2-1 victory over FlipSid3 in the closed qualifier to earn their spot in Leipzig. However, they got swept in thier highest ranked contest versus Mouz. So it goes without saying they're the underdog in this match-up. Betting odds are expectedly already trashed in favor of NaVi, although there is certainly some element of randomness here since we're talking about a Bo1, and NaVi has some history of starting slow. So on our end, although this should be an easy take for NaVi, we oriented towards just skipping this one since a percentages aren't rewarding enough, or simply risk some inventory overhead and trying our luck on ICB on SK.

Luminosity are in good shape following their Starseries Finals appearance, where they reached the semi-finals without a loss. They nearly advanced through to the Grand-Final, but were eliminated in the Semis against Fnatic, in what was a tightly fought contest. In the past few months, we've seen the Brazilians become one of the strongest American teams, lead by Coldzera who has been the man making the difference with his clutches, positive ratings, and obviously his overall personal skill. Due to their continued improvement, it's only matter of time before one these LAN events ends with LG on top. On the other hand, this will be the first tournament appearance for the former roster of Gamers2, now playing under the banner FaZe, the US organization that acquired Maikelele and friends this week. We have to point out the recent changes, and the events leading up to, may have affected the results of G2/FaZe who arrive here on a terrible losing streak, culminated in a 0-2 against Flipsid3 prior to stepping out of APM. Although, despite this, we're not quite sure what to expect from them this weekend. They might need more time to stabilize, or this new organization might possibly give them the right boost to get back on track in Leipzig. Odds are trending in favor of LG, which is correct, particularly considering recent LAN performances. Although FaZe could be a surprise, they'll need to prove their turnaround first. So on our end, we more confident in what Luminosity have recently achieved, so they're our pick for a Low Bet.

Through the past few weeks we saw Device and friends part ways with TSM, and compete as ex-TSM aka TQM (The Question Mark), but just few days ago they took the innovative step of creating their own organization, now called Astralis. They're coming to this event following a disappointing showing in Minsk for StarSeries Finals. However, considering all the off-game drama and stress of their org related issues, we're expcting to see a much relaxed and newly inspired performance from them, as they try to regain their prior form. On the other hand Dignitas have been playing at a decent level recently, and performing with consistency. Their only losses in 2016 coming at the hands of EnvyUs. For sure most of their opponents haven't been very high level, but victories have been marginal and on par with T2 competition. So this contest should be a good measuring stick for both teams. Betting Odds are currently trending well in favor of Astralis, which is correct since they're the higher tiered opponent. Historically they've held a mostly decisive edge over Dignitas, but we must remember anything can happen in just a single map game. But on our end, we're tempted ICB on the more consistent Dignitas, but honestly, we have high hopes in Astralis, so they're our pick for a Low+/Avg- Bet.

Mousesports are moving here during a month they've played a bit below their full potetial. Their recent roster-changes were supposed to have a much higher impact, and the improved firepower should have given to the Germans a greater advantage in order to bridge their gap with Tier-1. However, things haaven't really gone this way so far. Mouz had to deal with several overly tight matches, and overall, they still have to find a set of strats better suited for a refreshed playstyle. On the other hand, Virtus.Pro have been on break for more than a month. During which time, they played no official matches in January and just a single one in Dec. Thye're actually the biggest question mark stepping into this event. Generally the poles are usually a bit rusty in their opening game, and the Bo1 format won't help them either, so we wouldn't be surprised to see a closer than expected contest. Betting odds are currently well in favor of VP. But honestly, these values are kinda off, and don't appropriately reflect the lack of recent data regarding the Polish side. On our end, we find this game to be an extremely risky matchup, so we're more oriented in going with an ICB on Mouz rather than risking an Avg bet on VP.

ALTERNATE aTTaX are surely a quite new roster, but actually they provided a good set of convincingly performances, and at our side we're oriented in considering them a solid Tier-3 candidate. In the short-term they rolled over the former LC roster, tied a Bo2 with Mousesports and put up a good fight against SK, so today we wouldn't be surprised to see the Germans taking a map and offer a good fight. On the other hand E-Frag are currently floating in a mixed set of results, they started well in early January but in the following weeks they slowed down a bit, and right now we consider them kinda inconsistent, and not really reliable in matches featuring the extended map-pool. About maps we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, Dust2 should be in favor of Alternate, while Efrag will likely grab Overpass, and Train is going to be kinda random. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Bulgarians, but honestly we believe we'll watch a pretty tight game, so we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Alternate, in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

CSGL had quite a good late-December, and as a result they managed to salvage a little of a year where they experienced more lows than highs. However, as mentioned in their other match, January they played the 'Road to Vegas' Grand-Final, where they failed to hit map3 and overall, beside the 1st half if the entry map, never were much of a threat to OpTiC. Talking about the current game, due to the BO3 format, we're not expecting a very great show from the Poles, as we all know that they're training is always kinda limited to just a bunch of maps. So we doubt they'll manage to take down Scream and co. in a contest featuring the extended map-pool. On the other hand, ex-Titan haven't been really playing with the best mood, due to the recent shut-down of their Org, however they didn't do too bad at SLTV Finals. Despite these org-related issues they still managed to offer a consistent challenge against both ex-TSM and Fnatic, so with that in mind today, they undoubtedly favored. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_mirage, de_train and de_overpass. If the veto goes this way, ex-Titan should be able to take both Train and Overpass, while Mirage will favor CSGL. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+/Avg bet on ex-Titan, so for our pick, we're oriented in following this path.

FaZe/G2 returned from hell, and after several months played way below their full potential, they surprisingly managed to comeback in their entry game versus Luminosity, a roster that in the short-term surely delivered way more convincingly results compared to FaZe/G2. However, Maikelele and friends, probably pumped up thanks their new Org, delivered a quite great show on Inferno, and now we're kinda excited to see what they'll put up against NaVi. On the other hand, Natus Vincere didn't sweat too much against SK, and they dismissed them with a quick 16-3 sweep, but this was kinda expected, and surely the map-pick (de_mirage) didn't really help the Danes in offering a consistent fight. Surely in a Bo1 everything can happen, in particular with a pretty unpredictable team such as FaZe, but honestly NAVI started strong as well, so we're more oriented in going Low on GuardiaN and friends, rather thank risking on the FaZe roulette.

Both teams are moving here after a quite disappointing show in their entry match, Luminosity started really slow and suffered a lot the quick plays that FaZe managed to put up, the Brazilians somehow woke up in the late game, but it was way too late for delivering a comeback. Not much to say about SK, since they basically never really offered a consistent fight against Natus Vincere, and they weren't really ready to face one of the teams that always offered great performances on de_mirage. About the current match, we're talking about a Bo3, so both teams will have slightly more margin compared to the "hit or miss" of the Bo1s, however in our opinion Luminosity should have an edge, in particular if we'll see de_overpass, de_mirage and de_cbble as maps. If the veto will go so, the Danes may setup a proper fight on Cobblestone, but the other maps should be in favor of LG. Betting odds are already trash, so as usual we don't advice to bet on games featuring percentages around 90/10 (== skip), but if you really want to pick a side, Luminosity should be (obviously) favored.

Mousesports are moving here after an impressive show against Virtus.Pro, where Spiidi and friends quickly dismissed the Poles with a stunning 16-5 score, and basically dominated the whole Dust2. Honestly a pretty poor map-choice for VP, in particular on Lan and against Mouz. On the other hand, Astralis didn't sweat too much in taking down Dignitas, and even if they slowed down a bit in the 2nd half of Overpass, they never looked under heavy pressure, and they mostly managed the advantage, avoiding to spoil too much of their strats. Talking about the current game, we don't believe Mouz will experience an easy match at all, Astralis are way better trained than VP (the Poles were coming from a 2 months break), pumped up thanks to their new Org, and in particular way smarter in veto phase, so we're oriented in giving an edge to the Danes. However, worth noting that the current betting odds are already kinda trash, and not really profitable, so despite Astralis is our pick, we highly suggest to keep an eye on the values and go for an ICB on Mouz if their percentage moves below 20%.

The Poles suffered a lot in their entry match, and looks like they jumped in without even switching their brain on, however we have slightly higher hopes for this game, and TaZ and friends will likely wake up a bit now that they're risking elimination. On the other hand, Dignitas didn't do too bad versus Astralis, but honestly they never really turned into a real threat, and they could have delivered more in the first half of Overpass. Anyway, the Bo3 format isn't a good thing for the Danes, and the extended map-pool will likely allow VP to put together all the pieces and move back on the right track. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_mirage, de_cbble and de_train. If the veto will go so, VP should have an edge on Train and Mirage, while we wouldn't be surprised to see Dignitas taking Cobblestone. Betting odds are pretty skewed in favor of VP, and honestly we don't believe we'll watch the Polish side packing their bags so early, so we're oriented in going Low+ on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/3478!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7848!$FaZe!$LG!$LG!$0.48!$0.36!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Here we are on Day 2, kicking off the schedule with the Group A decider match at DreamHack Leipzig. The winner of this contest will advance through to the playoffs to face Astralis in the first Semi-Final. We had high hopes for Luminosity coming into this tournament, however we didn't see the same level of compete as we did during StarSeries Finals, particularly in their entry game. Instead LG seemed to have had their heads in the clouds. Although they improved some when facing elimination vs SK, they've yet to show the conviction and concentration we've seen in recent weeks. To their credit they've proved many times before that they are able to come back as a different team after some relaxing and a little sleep. A trend they'll hope to continue. Meanwhile, FaZe already beat the brazilians in first appearance with their new org, which was a surely a turn-around from the terrible play to begin 2016 as Gamers2. It would seem they're ready to return to competing at high levels against the best. This org change might have given them the spark needed to fuel their gameplay. In the winner's match though, FaZe was outplayed NaVi, but that wasn't an even contest to begin with considering the current form of NaVi, in addition to it being a BO1. As for this game, things are a little different now with the BO3 format and the removal of the single map randomness. Following the veto, there's good chances we'll watch de_inferno, de_mirage, and de_train. Provided the veto goes this way, Train will be in favor of LG, (considering the Day 1 win at Inferno) FaZe may have a slight edge there, while Mirage could go either way. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor of the LG, however Real World Odds much closer to even at 52/48 in the Brazilians' favor. On our end, we're expecting quite a balanced match, that will likely require all 3 maps to decide the winner, and maybe even some OT. Honestly, we're not quite sure if Maikelele &amp; Co. will be able repeat their exploit of LG, especially on the extended map-pool, so our pick is Low Bet on Luminosity to awaken on Day 2.

Mousesports have played exceptionally on Day 1, blowing out VP in their entry game, and followed that up with an incredible battle with Astralis in the winner's match. Although the Germans fell short in OT (19-22), in one the most entertaining maps of the weekend so far, so Mouz appear to be in strong form entering this bo3. Meanwhile, Dignitas never really threatened against Astralis in their entry game, but surprised many when beating Virtus.Pro to stave off elimination. The Danes got off to a rough start losing on Cache, but managed turn things around on Mirage, convincingly 16-7, carried their momentum into OT on Cobblestone and sent the Poles packing. As for maps, we believe we'll watch de_cbble, de_train, and de_mirage. Should the veto go this way, Cobblestone will favor the Danes, while Mouz will have the edge on Mirage, and Train can go either way. Betting odds are trending in favor Mouz, and like the other decider, Real-World Odds are 55/45 in their favor. We're inclined to agree, since they've been more consistent through the play this event. However, as we said earlier, VP was the greatest question-mark this weekend for a number of reasons, and didn't play at the level as Astralis did against Mouz. So our pick is a Low Bet on Mousesports.

Astralis topped their group advancing here undefeated. Despite their entry game had gone quite smoothly, the winner's match was way more challenging, and they had to fight hard in order to overcome Mousesports. Overall the Danes looked a bit shaky versus Mouz, and took many risks, but the BO1 format is always open to these kind of close games, so we're too surprised by what the Germans managed to put up, particularly since they were playing on home soil. As for Luminosity, they're surely heading into this game well warmed up by the Decider they played this morning, where they rolled over FaZe in pretty easy fashion, delivering a quick 2-0 sweep. Overall, LG are a bit hard to read. Theres no question they have great potential, but they look a bit slow in adapting, and even against SK they didn't shine as much as they should've. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_inferno, de_mirage and de_train. If this is how the veto goes, Astralis may take Mirage, while both Inferno and Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, aligned evenly near the middle, so at our end we're slightly more oriented in playing safe and go Low on Astralis, mostly because we've found them slightly more consistent, but wouldn't be surprised to see the Brazilians pushed this match to its limts.

Natus Vincere have been idle since finishing atop Group A, which wasn't surprising as the best in their group. They haven't had to work too hard so far to arrive here, after bo1 wins over SK and FaZe. This was all following a very strong showing in StarSeries Finals, where they lost to Fnatic in the Finals. So they're sure to have their sights set on the finals in Leipzig as well. Meanwhile, the currrent surprise of the tournament, Dignitas have fought for every round to have advanced to their first Major semi-final with the current roster. Following a rough start against Astralis, the Danes rebounded with wins over VP, and clean sweep earlier to day against Mouz. Their victory in the decider is tricky to evaluate since the German side had a sub-par showing, but the Danish took full advantage, and enter this contest warmed up, along with some extra confidence. As for the semi, we'll likely see a much closer match than expected. NaVi has only played 2 maps so far, neither of which really tested them, while the Danes already played 6 maps. An edge they'll surely need for the test that awaits them. After the Veto, theres good chances we'll see de_overpass, de_train, and de_cbble. Should these be the maps, NaVi will be advantaged on Overpass and Cobblestone, while Train will favor the Dignitas. Currently, Betting Odds are well in favor of NaVi, however real-world odds are quite as lopsided, but surely favor the CIS side. On our end, we're confident NaVi is destined to win their first major of the year soon, and although they may have to work harder than expected to beat the Danes, we doubt they'll lose 2 maps (as long as they're smart during the Veto). So our pick is NaVi for Average Bet, but keep an eye of the percentages. Should they reach the 85/15 threshold, risking an ICB on Dignitas is worth consideration.
http://csgo.guru/match/3492!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7856!$LG!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.45!$0.51!$-0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$So after a couple of days packed with matches, and several upsets later, we finally reached the DreamHack Leipzig Grand-Final, and surely one that not many were expecting. Natus Vincere moved here in relatively easy fashion without breaking much of a sweat. After-all, through the easiest bracket. During their journey to the top, they didn't face any real powerhouse of an opponent. And after a couple of quick sweeps in the Group Stage, they rolled over Dignitas in the Semi-Final, again without needing to setup their very best. On the other hand, Luminosity without a doubt, experienced a more exciting weekend. The entry-game failure against FaZe forced the Brazilians into a couple of extra Elimination matches. And after a 2nd game where they still played below their full potential (a way too close contest), they finally managed to step up and provided a couple of definitive top-tier performances, dismissing both FaZe and Astralis with decisive 2-0 scores. Surely a mostly impressive ending to day 2, especially for a team that experienced so much adversity during the first day of the event. In our opinion, the maps we'll watch will be: de_overpass, de_mirage and de_inferno. Assuming the veto goes this way, Mirage should be in favor of NaVi, while both Overpass and Inferno will be pretty balanced. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of LG, which is a bit surprising, since NAVI have generally performed a bit better for longer duration in recent weeks/months. Meanwhile Luminosity never fully managed to turn their stronger International showings into a trophy. At our end we're slightly more oriented in sticking with a Low bet on NAVI, mostly because we believe that they still have some aces up their sleeves (due the easier bracket). Either way, this is a becoming a very exciting rivalry between two teams who show great promise for the new year, and may likely meet on a similar stage with some repetition this year.

Lately, WinterFox seem to have waken up, and have turned into a serious and consistent NA mid-tier contender. They moved through the shuffle harmlessly, and now they're sporting a 'confidence advantage' over most of other American lineups who underwent heavy face-lifts through the shuffle. However, today they are messing with one of the hottest trending teams of the NA scene. OpTiC, just like Wfox, didn't face issues during the shuffle, and even though they may have slowed their run a bit lately, they are still one of the big surprises of this Quarter. And yesterday they showed it one more time by destroying the new TSM roster with a quick 2-0 sweep. Betting odds are quite skewed in favor of OpTic, and we agree on this, since we don't believe we'll watch WinterFox take more than a map. Although percentages aren't really great right now, our pick is still OpTiC, so we highly suggest to evaluate a skip.

SPLYCE have been pretty inconsistent over the short-term against mid-tiered NA teams, as we've frequently watched them choking in BO3s. However, a week ago they still managed to take down OpTiC, which is surely relevant, not just because it was a pretty important match, but also because the Canadians are definitely one of the hottest NA teams of Q1, so we're not referring to a low-tiered opponent. On the other hand, Games Academy are always pretty interesting to watch. The Brazilians play a very similar style to their 'big brothers' Luminosity, and they're quite dangerous due to the really fast gameplay. Yesterday they took down Torqued in pretty easy fashion, so we're confident we'll watch them do fine today as well. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, along with the real-world ones which are basically around 50/50, so picking a side is rather challenging. But on our end, we find GA to be a slightly more 'complete' team, compared to Splyce, so the Brazilians are our pick for a Low bet.

Honestly, this isn't entirely the match-up anyone expected, and overall a tricky contest to evaluate. Games Academy has looked good throughout the event, and handled SPLYCE more effeciently than expected. Their faster playstyle, as demonstrated by LG, is quite effective in the NA scene. And surely look up to task in matching their finals opponent. WinterFox on the other hand, has kinda been 'all business' this weekend. They haven't thrown up any crazy strats to gain their spot here, but played smartly and tactically, as we saw as they dispatched the tournament favorite OpTic. Wfx has been steadily piecing together strong performances, and quite consistent to their form. They should make a good matchup to the Brazilians, as they'll battle it out extended map-pool. Betting Oddds are trending in favor of the Brazilian side, but real world are surely aligned quite evenly. And this should surely be a 3 map bout. On our end, we're oriented in attempting a Low pick on GA, but this is a game that can easily go both ways, so avoid risking too much.

Even if Vexed over the short-term haven't performed too well, they are always a really tricky team to face, since they follow a pretty unpredictable pattern, and generally they step-up a lot when they faced top-tier teams. Honestly, in the past weeks, their form has looked quite decent, even if they mostly faced minor/low-tier teams. Anyway, versus Envy we don't really believe we'll watch the Poles taking more than a map. On the other hand EnVyUs played their last official match at StarSeries Finals, where they fell to NAVI after a couple of rather promising contests against Astralis and Fnatic. Generally, the Frenchmen have a bad habit of underestimating low-tier opponents, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch Envy struggling a bit during the 1st map, even though we're talking about a LAN-decider match, where the winner will move forward to GSG Offline Finals. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cbble, de_inferno and de_overpass. If the veto goes like this, on paper Envy should be advantaged on all of them, but as we wrote above, with teams like Vexed you never know. Betting odds are already trash, so we don't really suggest to waste your time with a match sporting 90/10 odds, so you can skip the whole thing without regrets. However, if you really want to pick a side, as you may guess, EnVyUs is the way to go.

FlipSid3 lately are on a quite impressive streak, their form is pretty high and they are one of the mid-tier teams that displayed the most interesting things in the short-term. They somehow managed to workaround the departure of DavCost, and actually they started playing in a simple but kinda effective way. On the other hand CPH Wolves are just the old Unu.AiN roster, surely an interesting one since Hunden and the gang never performed too bad, however they don't really field an huge firepower, and most of their focus is just on smart and quick plays. Overall, we wouldn't be surprised to watch CPHW taking a map, but on the extended map-pool FlipSid3 should be a good step ahead, so they're our pick for a Low+/Avg- bet. Worth noting that the current Betting Odds aren't really great, so we suggest to wait a bit and eventually skip if they drop below 18/82.

SPLYCE has been busy with RGN/MLG contests, where they've had a bag of mixed results. They did manage an impressive upset OpTic in the Semi-Final, only to be swept by Enemy in the MLG Minor Grand Final. Their latest contest last weekend was also a disappointing showing, and another sweep loss against Games Academy. From what we've seen, the CA/US roster is an emotional group, so they'll surely be aiming to settle a score in today's match. Enemy, on the other hand, enter this contest riding a decent win streak, having not lost since their first match of the year vs WinterFox. Granted their schedule hasn't been the most challenging, but they won MLG's Minor Championship, completing sweeps over SPLYCE and Winterfox along the way. Notable victories, considering raised stakes of the games. Overall, NME has been playing with more consistency and improved teamplay over the short term, and have shown promise to be a T2 contender. Since we're talking about Counter Pit, we're looking at a high probability for a tie. Currently, Betting Odds skewed well in favor of NME but Real World Odds are not as steep around 55/45 for NME's advantage. On our end though, we're still confident with what NME has displayed recently, and doubt the lose more than a map here, particularly considering SPLYCE never really threatened the last time they met. So our pick is Low+ Bet on Enemy to keep their streak alive. But keep an eye on the percentages, should they reach 85/15, risking an ICB on SPLYCE is worthwhile.

Dignitas lately aren't doing too bad, but they are still kinda inconsistent against top-tier teams, and even if they managed to take down Virtus.Pro, we're oriented in considering that just a case rather than a real trend. However, they're generally pretty on-point versus T2/3 teams, so they should be able to offer a good fight today. On the other hand Mousesports are generally slightly more consistent than Dignitas against top-tier teams, in particular in Bo1 matches, however they always suffered a bit the Bo3 format, and frequently we watched them choking versus mid-tier opponents, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them struggling a bit against Dignitas, in particular during the early game. At our end we're oriented in picking a Low bet on Dignitas, since we find them more reliable in this kind of matches.

This match will award a Katowice spot to the winner, so we're talking about an extremely relevant contest for what is at stake.. Mousesports moved here after dismissing Dignitas with a quick 2-0 sweep, where we honestly expected more from the Danes, particular when they should have managed the veto better. However, Mouz are looking back on point, and now they're the obvious favorite of this match too. As for CPH Wolves we've to say we're kinda shocked to see them so far in the bracket, however they managed to setup a pretty great and smart match versus FlipSid3, and they're surely competing in at an enjoyable level. At our end we're oriented in going Low+ on Mouz, mostly because we don't believe we'll watch them missing the Qualification, and overall their experience and momentum is marginally above CPHW.
http://csgo.guru/match/3507!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7907!$Astralis!$ATN!$Astralis!$0.7!$0.89!$-0.19000000000000006!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$The only 'tiered' EU match scheduled for today, and honestly we're not expecting huge surprises out of it, in particular since we're talking about a BO3. This game is also the GSG Cup LAN decider, so the winner of this contest will move ahead to the offline Finals. However worth noting that most of the Major teams never really focused too much on this event, so even if Astralis are obviously advantaged, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them pulling out from the League even in case of Qualification (Q1 2016 is packed with events, so teams are forced to focus on relevant events). Anyway, talking about ALTERNATE aTTaX, they're without doubts one of the German teams that surprised us the most, they are still below the Mouz level, but actually above the Penta one, so if they'll keep playing so, they might turn into a good candidate for a T2 spot. Talking about the current match, we don't think we'll watch Astralis failing in more than a map, so they should be able to bring home a victory, in particular if we'll see de_cbble, de_dust2 &amp; de_train as maps. Unfortunately betting odds already turned into trash, so even if our pick is Astralis we cannot really suggest to bet on a match sporting 90/10 percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/3508!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7905!$WinterFox!$NME!$null!$0.48!$0.34!$0.13999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Another slow day on the NA schedule, but we do have one relevant match to watch, and actually a pretty interesting matchup between two teams who've showed distinct improvments over the short-term. There's not too much say about this contest, but we're thrilled to see the teams within T3 become as competitive as they have, forming some legitimate T2 contenders. WinterFox, as we've discussed recently, has finally found some consistency in their game, and less susceptible to the random fails they made habit of during the Fall '15. They recently reached the MLG pre-qualifier Grand-Final, which included a notable victory over OpTic, before falling to Games Academy. And the previous two contests with NME, we've seen each team manage to take one of them. So this should be a good match to evaluate their current form. Meanwhile, Enemy has continued to extend their win streak, having not lost since they battled Wfx two meetings ago. They've since put up consectutive 2-0 wins over SPLYCE, and have an opportunity to make statement as one of the best within the NA mid-tier. However, based on their previous bouts, the Veto will be a critical variable in the outcome, in our opinion we'll watch de_dust2, de_cache and de_inferno. If it'll go so, WinterFox should have an edge on Inferno, while Cache will likely go in favor of Enemy. Currently, Betting Odds are trending in favor of NME, which is appropriate with the win streak they're enter today with. However, as implied above, real-world odds are much closer aligned to even, only give a slight edge to Enemy. On our end, we're inclined to agree, but with this being such an equal contest, we're towards playing the percentages and going with the more rewarding pick. So tonight our pick is WinterFox to settle the score, but honestly (we'd rather see a more conclusive BO3 format) but this is Counter Pit, so we'll likely just see this end in a draw.
http://csgo.guru/match/3509!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7921!$Splyce!$WinterFox!$null!$0.45!$0.26!$0.19!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Some more Counter Pit action on an otherwise slow evening on the NA schedule. SPLYCE we've seen with some frequency this past month, unfortunately, they've only managed a single noteworthy victory, against OpTic two weeks back. Other than that, the cast formerly of 3sUP, seem to have continued their struggles with consistency under the new banner. This will be the second their meeting versus WinterFox with the currently constructed lineup, and in their first encounter, the two split the maps and settled with a draw. Meanwhile, WinterFox, as we stated repeated, has surely found some rhythm in their game, playing at consistent mid-tier level. They enter this contest following a pretty strong outing yesterday against Enemy (who've been on a win streak), which ended in a draw. But its worth noting, Wfx recovered from a wretched 1st half on Overpass, to force the game into OT. Then followed up with a convincing win on Inferno. Though the end was a Tie, Wfx surely setup a stronger performance, which is something we've been seeing with some regularity. Current Betting Odds are skewed heavily in favor in Wfx, but this matchup is undoubtedly much more balanced than that, with Real-world odds edging in Wfx's favor 55/45. But we are talking about a BO2, so we're of course looking at high chances of another draw. On our end, we doubt we'll see WInterFox lose both maps, and have greater confidence in them grabbing both maps, so they're our pick a Low+/Avg- Bet
http://csgo.guru/match/3510!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7917!$Titan!$mouz!$mouz!$0.55!$0.46!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty interesting BO3, featuring two teams that are currently playing at a pretty similar level. ex-Titan is moving here after a barely acceptable showing at StarSeries Finals, where they failed to take down Astralis and Fnatic, ending their journey early. However, it is worth noting that they didn't perform too badly, in contests with scores that were pretty tight. Actually their level should be a tiny bit above Mouz, but we've some concerns related to the veto, since the French/Belgian side lately hasn't played it in a smart way at all. On the other hand, Mousesports are quite a decent streak, performance-wise, while they're currently leading Tier2, as they are also sporting a quite high form. Additionally they've performed pretty well at DH Leipzig too, and what they achieved against VP and Astralis is without a doubt, extremely promising. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cbble, de_overpass and de_mirage. If this is how the veto goes, Overpass should be in favor of ex-Titan, Mirage will likely go to Mouz, and Cobblestone is going to be a 50/50 contest. Betting odds are currently pretty aligned to the middle, and this is correct since we're talking about an extremely balanced match. At our end we're a bit more oriented in attempting a Low pick on ex-Titan, since we find them slightly more reliable on the extended map-pool; but overall we're talking about a really risky game that can easily go both ways.

Penta lately faced quite heavy struggles, the new mixed roster is a good step below the previous one, and actually within the German scene we're prone in considering them even behind Alternate. In the short-term they failed in playing on par against most of their T3 opponents, and they mostly achieved a couple of kinda irrelevant victories. So unlike many people believe, the Germans aren't really one of the favorite teams. On the other hand, LDLC White always been a pretty inconsistent roster, they never really managed to step-up their game in BO3 contests, but they used to be pretty decent in BO1s, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them playing the Minor Groupstage in a decent way, however we don't see them advancing too much, in particular when they'll have to meet with well organized teams such as Efrag or HR. Betting odds are a bit too skewed in favor of Penta, while real-world ones are slightly more balanced, so at our end we're oriented in taking advantage of this by going Low on LDLC White, since we're mostly talking about a game with an high RNG component, due the inconsistent BO1 format.

LemonDogs are basically the former AliGon roster, and over the short-term we can't say they've been very successful. Basically this is the only decent event they managed to get into, and at this point, we're not expecting any amazing stuff from them against HellRaisers, even if the BO1 format has a better chance of leading to surprises. On the other hand, HellRaisers achieved a mixed bag of results in January, and they are still in a kinda troubled moment, particularly their roster which still looks like a "work in progress" rather than stable. However, skill-wise they should have a clear edge. So its mostly a matter of getting motivated for the contest. Betting odds have already turned to trash, so we can't really suggest betting with odds floating around 90/10, so even if our pick is HR, you should consider a skip.

E-Frag moved here without sweating too much, they rolled over CG in a pretty easy fashion, delivering an impressive T side on de_mirage, and then controlling the game after the switch till the end. Overall the Bulgarians looked pretty on-point, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them moving forward. On the other hand, Penta in their entry game had to deal with some troubles, since LDLC White took the lead and were pretty near in closing the match too, but the German mix somehow managed to deliver a late-game comeback and won 16-13. As we stated several times already, the Penta roster is kinda inconsistent right now, so we don't really feel fine in picking them in a BO3. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_inferno and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, E-Frag should have an edge on Dust2 and Cobblestone, while Inferno may go in favor of Penta. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on E-Frag, so we're oriented in taking this path.

However, now we're talking about a BO3, so the RNG factor is surely lower, and then Penta may take advantage of the experience, together with their wider strats coverage over the extended map-pool. As mentioned above, right now there is no way to guess the veto, since we're not aware of the CG pattern yet, so we have to wait a bit in order to deliver this kind of Intel. Betting odds are still decent for a Low pick on Penta, so we're oriented in following this path, mostly in order to avoid risks related to the CG roulette (but honestly we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Swedes taking a map).

Mousesports lately are doing pretty well, and currently they are sitting on a totally respectable winning streak. Finally the German side managed to iron out all the little issues (mostly related to the roster changes) they were experiencing in early January, and actually they are looking like a serious T1 contender and surely the hottest T2 team of the month. On the other hand, Dignitas used to perform pretty well too, but lately their run slowed down a bit, and in their latest game against Mouz they looked a bit shaky and not really reactive in adjusting their gameplay according to what Nex and co. were fielding. However we shouldn't forget that they are still a roster fully capable to deliver AAA shows in relevant matches, and what they displayed at DH Leipzig is surely promising. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cbble, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto will go so, Dignitas should have an edge on Cobblestone, while Mouz will likely take Mirage, and Train can easily go both ways. Overall this is a really risky and pretty balanced match, betting odds are currently trending in favor of Mouz thanks to their strongest momentum, but we wouldn't be surprised to watch Dignitas doing well too. However, even if we're prone in giving a little edge to Mouz, the current percentages are a bit too off, so we're slightly more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Dignitas, just because the more rewarding values.

NiP in the short-term played just a couple of matches, and currently this is their first game after a 2-weeks break, so evaluating their current level is surely a bit tricky. There isn't much we can say, in particular because in the current year they played just a single game against E-Frag, so we're not even referring to a super relevant one. On the other hand, ex-Titan despite the kinda questionable results played way more, following a more logical pattern, and actually we've no doubts in saying that right now their form is above the NiP one. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_train. If the veto will go so, NiP should have an edge on Cobblestone, while Titan may grab Dust2, and Train should be kinda random. Betting odds are totally no-sense, we're mostly talking about a balanced Tier-1 match, and we should keep in mind that NiP basically never played in January, so we don't see any reason for not going ICB/Low on ex-Titan, in order to take advantage of the pretty skewed percentages.

LemonDogs are moving here after a 14-16 loss against HellRaisers, on a match where with slightly more effort they could have delivered an upset. However, we're one more time referring to a BO1, so even if out of the two the entry matches, surely LD looked better than DenDD, we should keep in mind that we're talking about games mostly decided by maps and luck rather than real patterns. Anyway, according to what we watched so far, we're slightly more oriented in going Low on LemonDogs rather than trying our luck with DenDD, mostly because Zende and co. looked pretty out of form and not really focused.

HellRaisers are moving here after a tight victory over LemonDogs, and honestly at our end we were expecting a bit more from Kucher and friends, however now that we moved to the BO3 format there are good chances to watch HR stepping up a bit compared to their entry game. On the other hand PixelFire delivered an amazing show against DenDD, and we weren't really expecting to watch a 'total domination' as we did, however we suggest to wait a bit before joining the PF hype-train, mostly because evaluating a team from a single BO1 is an huge mistake, and even if the PixelFire roster is definitely looking interesting, and without doubts a bit out of the ordinary in both composition and playstyle, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them struggling a bit with the extended map-pool. Since guessing the veto is almost impossible due the lack of data about PF, we are oriented in playing safe with a Low pick on HR, but there are surely good chances to watch a close match and 3 maps played.

PixelFire are headed into this game right after a pretty great show against HellRaisers, and without a doubt a match they could have won. But at the end, HR kinda woke up and somehow managed to close it out (despite them not playing stellar at all). Overall PixelFire are one of the surprises of this event. They are playing in a pretty enjoyable way by following a mix of styles instead of a static pattern, and quite fascinating. In the future we would be glad to watch more from them. On the other hand, DenDD rolled over LemonDogs and landed in this contest, however as we already stated several times, their current roster is totally unstable and quite unreliable, particularly strats-wise. So we highly doubt we'll watch the Swedes doing great in the BO3 format, especially against a team (PF) that displayed rather decent tactical awareness. Betting odds are still moving a lot, but at our end we're prone in picking a Low+ bet on PixelFire, with the hope to watch them playing as they did early today.

Penta hasn't fully come to form just yet, narrowly escaping the Decider match versus CG, in a contest surely absent of their potential. That was following a very lackluster defeat against E-frag. But it should've been to their advantage in making use of a day off to regroup and ready themselves for a new day. HellRaisers on the other hand, had similar experience in their Winner's match vs PixelFire, where they too barely survived defeat. But they managed keep composure and close out both Inferno and Overpass 16-14. Compared to their European counterparts, oskar and friends seem to be closer to their true form. This will be the first encounter between these two teams, as their rosters are currently constructed, but a majority of both do share a mostly even match history last quarter. About the veto, there are good chances we'll see de_dust2, de_mirage, and de_cache. Assuming this is how the selection goes, HellRaisers will have the advantage on Dust and Cache, while Penta should have the edge on Mirage. Current Betting Odds are still moving, but skewed well in favor of HR, which is obviously in line with our end. So as long as the percentages remain above the ICB threshold, HR are our pick for a Low+ Bet.

E-frag has barely broken a sweat yet this tournament, which was also mostly expected as one of the event favorites. Neither CG or Penta ever threatened the Bulgarians, so we've yet to see how they respond when really tested. From what we've seen so far though, they need be sure and not underestimate their opponents. Those opponenets not to be taken likely, and also the surprise of the tournment to this point, PixelFire has been an intriguing team to watch this weekend. Following a disappointing loss to HR in the Winner's Match, where on two consecutive maps, these newcomers just couldn't close out for the win after taking the lead late into the game, their 'afk' antics for the camera have seemed to translated to a resilient and surprisingly strong response game vs DenDD. In the that game we saw an epic battle go well past 30 rounds, before finally managing to take Mirage 41-38. Needless-to-say, they were quite inspired after that, and rolled over the Swedes with ease on Train. They've certainly been an impressive group to watch, so we're very curious to see how they handle themselves with the stakes raised even higher. But we honestly wouldn't be too surprised to see them force a 3rd map. Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Bulgarians side, which on paper in the pick that makes most sense. But at the same time, it's difficult to know how consistent PF will be. Particularly against another mid-teir opponent, when nerves gave way the first time round vs HR. From what we've seen from E-frag over the past weeks, we're oriented towards betting Low+ on them, according to their match pattern against sub-T3 teams. But if the percentages surpass 80/20, PF have surely demonstrated they worthy of an ICB.

This will be the second appearance from NRG, a lineup partially composed from the remnants of the former-Method squad. In their entry match, they drew OpTic, which had an outcome less than encouraging for new found NA/EU mix. But naturally, expectations are minimal till the new lineup develops some experience and team chemistry. Meanwhile Enemy, as we know, has been one of hotter mid-tier NA teams, carrying with them into this contest a fairly decent undefeated streak. One of their issues last year was in there handling of sub-T3 teams, losing matches despite being superior skill-wise. But over the short-term, this is a problem that seems to no longer apply to them. And honestly, we're not expecting huge surprise since we're talking about a BO2, and in the worst case we'll likely watch just a Tie. Current Betting Odds, as expected, are already trashed in favor NME, and from what they've shown lately, there's not much to dispute this. Since percentages aren't rewarding, the standard 'skip recommendation' is in place, but if you wanna pick, our pick is surely on relyks and co. to keep their streak going.

Anyway, in comparing both sides, HR looks to have had a slightly rougher run. So far they've seemed quite slow during the first part of their games, while the Bulgarians have surely played with more consistency in their game, avoiding any huge comebacks. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_inferno. If the veto will go this way, Dust2 should be fairly even, while Overpass will likely go to HR and Inferno may end in favor of EFrag. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of HR, but honestly this is plain wrong. Based on what we've seen thus far, E-Frag have displayed better things, even if we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game that can easily go both ways. However, our pick is a Low one on Efrag.

However, the former London Conspiracy roster, (now known as PANTERS) isn't too bad, and even though their results have been mixed in the short-term, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking home a map and hitting a Tie. Its worth noting that the Norwegians never really put up anything too complex, and historically they've been a roster that was rather easy to 'read' and counter, so we doubt we'll watch SK failing on both maps. On the other hand, SK are currently one of the hottest Tier-3 teams, who despite their struggles against very high-ranked teams, they've already turned into a pretty serious threat for most of the mid-tier lineups. Additionally, their current form should be decent, so we're oriented towards considering them fairly reliable. Betting odds are already skewed in favor of SK, which is correct, but unfortunately the percentages right now aren't really rewarding and the values are still moving a lot, so we suggest to wait a bit before placing a bet and eventually just skip if the odds move below 80/20. However, if you are not concerned about the bad percentages, our pick is a Low+/Avg- on SK.
http://csgo.guru/match/3558!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7963!$NRG!$WinterFox!$null!$0.45!$0.51!$-0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Two games on the NA schedule tonight, and we'll start out with what should be the most interesting contest of the day, but a tricky one to predict. NRG, partially composed of the former Method roster, is still in their infancy as a new team and hasn't played much yet, but enters today fresh off a bit of a 'statement' game last night versus Enemy. In a contest prone to draws with the BO2 format, NRG appeared both impressive and quite decisive in their 2-0 sweep of NME, who've been in good form for a few weeks now. The EU/NA mix has more of an EU playstyle, which can be especially dangerous versus NA teams on slower maps, making the Veto much more important in these contests. Based on what they showed yesterday, we're very interested in watching their progression. On the other, WinterFox has settled with a couple of draws in their most recent bouts, maintaining their seed at the top of the Counter Pit NA group. However, the momentum they carried to begin the year seems to have tapered somewhat, exposing some of the cracks in their game. With NRG surely bringing some added confidence with them to this game, the slow starts Wfx has been prone to in the past, makes this game a pretty dangerous one for them. Betting Odds are still moving around quite a bit, and currently they sit mostly even. Meanwhile, Real-World Odds give the 55/45 advantage to the more consistent and experienced WinterFox squad. On our end, we're actually inclined to evaluate a skip, since we have so little to go on regarding NRG. (One very uninspired loss, and one impressive victory) With so little to reference, a pick is mostly just a guess. But if you want to pick, we slightly more oriented towards going Low on WinterFox, mostly because their experience, however we'll probably watch just a Tie .
http://csgo.guru/match/3559!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7964!$SKDC!$NME!$null!$0.3!$0.12!$0.18!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$The second game and final contest on the NA schedule this evening. This is the first Counter Pit League S2 match for SKDC, who've yet to really achieve any positive results. Even in most of their non-ranked matchups, they haven't managed to setup anything too promising, and still aways off from serious contention with the current 3rd Tier. Enemy on the other hand, enter this game following a humbling defeat yesterday against NRG, in a loss that basically began with horrible Veto. Prior to that contest, NME had been one hotter North Americans teams, which we discussed on multiple occasions. Although, during that run, Relyks and friends, weren't really tested by the most difficult schedule. But it could argued, such a loss may be of great benefit to them. Regardless, we're not expecting any surprises from this contest. Betting Odds are already trashed in favor of NME, which is obviously correct. Coming off of last night's loss, we might see NME trying out few things to address their shortcomings yesterday, so theres a chance we might see a slightly closer than expected match today. Despite the percentages, if you want pick instead of skip, an Average bet on Enemy is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/3563!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7972!$PF!$CSGL!$CSGL!$0.52!$0.45!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite an interesting game to start the day. This is the first online match for PixelFire since the PGL Minor, where they played fairly well, becoming one of the revelations of the event. Overall we're talking about a pretty dangerous roster. They follow a fairly complex pattern, which is not easy to counter, particularly for 'static' teams that are kinda slow in 'adjusting'. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing fine in this game as well. On the other hand CSGL experienced a quite horrible January, losing all their relevant matches since the E-League Road to Vegas loss, and they've confirmed once again that they have serious issues in dealing with BO3s. After a year, they're still playing a very limited set of maps. And out of them they rarely put up decent things, so despite the higher experience compared to PF, we have serious concerns about their reliability. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_mirage. Should the veto go this way, we're mostly talking about a set of maps that can easily go either ways. Betting odds are still quite balanced, and we'll likely watch a tight match, but honestly we're a bit more prone in attempting a Low pick on PixelFire. Not just because they played the Minor well, but moreso due to the quite high inconsistency of CSGL.
http://csgo.guru/match/3564!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7970!$Penta!$E-Frag!$null!$0.42!$0.2!$0.21999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Busy week out of the Counter Pit League, moving to the EU group we have two teams fresh off the PGL Minor this past weekend. The event didn't offer the best from Penta, who've struggled to find their form this year. Their chance to reach the MLG Lan qualifier in Columbus came to an end in their loss to HellRaisers. But the German side did put up a decent fight, in what was probably one of their better outings. So they did at least manage some positive things to be encouraged by. Meanwhile, E-Frag was more technical and polished in their play over the weekend. Granted, they were a finals favorite out the teams attending, but they did compete much closer to their normal level. The Bulgarians were outmatched by HR in the Grand-Final, but they also faced Penta in the Winner's match, where they offered a dominant performance. Honestly, we're expecting much of the same here today. Since we're talking about a BO2, there is good chances of seeing a tie if the Germans can compete closer to the full potential. But as mentioned, we're not expecting any surprises here. So on our end, we're inline with the current Betting odds favoring E-frag, but with percentages already 80/20, we're oriented towards skipping with so little reward. But if you want to Bet, our pick is for the Bulgarians to put up a repeat performance.
http://csgo.guru/match/3565!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7979!$FSid3!$Panthers!$null!$0.58!$0.78!$-0.20000000000000007!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Honestly we're not expecting too much out of this BO2. FlipSid3 played a rather stunning January. What they were able to achieve was surely promising, but their recent fail against CPH Wolves sounded some alarms, so we might watch Markeloff and friends slowing their run a bit. Especially since most of the other teams are regaining their form, and the amount of events rises on a weekly basis. On the other hand, the former London Conspiracy roster, now known as PANTERS, isn't really solid yet. Even if they started pretty well in their entry games early this month, they've slowed down a bit like FlipSid3 has. The Norwegians failed to deliver a consistent fight against SK, revealing their increased difficulty in closing matches. Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of FSid3, and even if we highly doubt we'll watch them losing both maps, we can't really suggest to pick them while percentages are edging the ICB threshold. So our pick is an ICB on PANTERS, even if we'll likely just watch another Tie.
http://csgo.guru/match/3566!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7966!$WinterFox!$Splyce!$Splyce!$0.6!$0.6!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for WinterFox, so they're heading here well warmed up for this Winter Classic upper bracket semi-final. Their entry game against NRG was way harder than expected. They faced serious issues in dealing with the EU/NA mix, and only in the last side of de_cache they finally managed to wake up and deliver a stunning comeback that closed the game with a Tie. However, we're expecting a slightly more consistent show from them in this contest, and honestly the SPLYCE level (skill-wise) is quite below that of NRG, and in the short-term they failed to put up anything too relevant, but managed a draw in their last meeting with Wfx. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_cache, de_dust2 and de_inferno. If this is how the veto goes, Inferno should go to Wfox, while Splyce may grab Dust2, leaving Cache which can easily go either way. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on WinterFox so we're oriented in following this (slightly more reliable) path, rather than taking risks on the Splyce roulette.

They are moving here after a Tie against Enemy, and honestly this wasn't a bad result, compared to the kinda poor shows that the former SKDC lineup used to deliver in past months. However, Enemy kinda lost their momentum, and they seem to be in a pretty descending phase after a month of peaking (within the NA Tier-2). So this should be kept in mind when evaluating that Tie. On the other hand, yesterday SPLYCE steamrolled WinterFox in pretty easy fashion. Which was quite surprising since Wfox were doing really well as of late, and over the short-term turned into a pretty solid team. Based on this, we're expecting to watch Splyce doing well today as well, especially because the former SKDC lineup is supposed to be a good step below them. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on Splyce, so we're oriented in going this way, since we find them slightly more reliable than AGG.
http://csgo.guru/match/3570!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7977!$NME!$GAcademy!$NME!$0.48!$0.31!$0.16999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Late addition to the NA schedule and a pretty interesting one. We end the day with the other Winter Classic II upper-bracket semi-final, where the winner will advance to face SPLYCE in the UB final. We've given much credit to Enemy for the strides they taken in last several weeks. However, their momentum has slowed greatly by a couple of newer teams looking to make a splash in the NA scene. NRG put an end to the undefeated streak NME carried, in very disappointing 0-2 sweep, in a contest that took advantage of very poor Veto. NME followed that up with draw vs AGG, despite the clear advantage they entered the game with. This sudden inconsistency was a common issue for Enemy in 2015, and a pattern they must break to breach the mid-tier. Games Academy on the other hand, has kinda flown under the radar, stringing together a number of strong performances, and continue to be a serious threat to NA talent-pool. Although the Brazilians have been idle for a little over week, so we make see a shaky start from them early in the contest. This will be the first time these two meet since the GA roster shuffle, but playstyle of GA closely resembles that of the team that overpowered NME last November. This is surely reflected in the current Betting Odds that are skewed in favor of the Brazilians, however Real-World Odds much closer to even, giving a slight edge to GA. On our end, we're have some reservations about what Enemy has shown recently, so we're moreso oriented towards viewing BOLTZ and co. as the more reliable team. So they are our pick for Low Bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/3575!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7987!$AGG!$WinterFox!$WinterFox!$0.42!$0.36!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not too much to say about the one North American match this evening, since we'll likely again just watch a draw. The ex-SKDC squad AGG have managed to put up some things a step above their normal level, hitting ties in their first two contests under the new banner versus SPLYCE and Enemy. Suppose there is the possibility that the organization change was 'just what the doctor ordered'. Too soon to know just yet, but we'll surely be keeping an eye on them. Winterfox on the other hand, is coming off of a very poor 0-2 showing last night against SPLYCE. The margin in which they lost is whats most surprising, especially considering how well they've been playing. But we're expecting a different tone from them today. Currently, the Betting Odds are skewed well in favor of Wfx, but considering the most recent play of both teams, Real-World odds are less lopsided 58/24. On our end, we're expecting Wfx to rebound so they're our pick for a Low+ Bet, unless the percentages edge the ICB threshold for AGG to catch em while they're down. But we'll likely just watch the two split the maps.

But this Group A Opening match isn't quite the most exciting of matchups. One of the two NA representatives here, CLG, hasn't played any relevant matches since December (only 2 sub-T3 matches), so we're not quite sure what expect from them. Even their wins in those low-end games weren't the most impressive. Overall, they finished the year a step below the level achieved in the 3rd Quarter. But still managed an invite here by defeating two unranked teams in Dec. EnvyUs on the other hand, is surely the more to form team in this game, having played a busy 1st half of January with mostly decent results, despite a couple hiccups. But overall, they've been battling consistently in Tier-1 matches. So for their entry game in this event, we're not expecting any surprises. After-all, we are talking about the likely favorite for the finals. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_inferno, de_cache and de_train. If the veto goes that way, Envy should have an edge on both Inferno and Cache, while Train may go both ways. Betting Odds are already trash, as expected. Especially since all the games will feature the extended map-pool. Honestly, these percentages are basically a default skip evaluation, but on our end, confidence is high enough on the Frenchmen, for an Average Bet, if you must pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/3577!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7991!$Dignitas!$FSid3!$Dignitas!$0.55!$0.72!$-0.16999999999999993!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving on the other Opening Match at the GEC Finals in Vilnius, Lithuania. The second Group A entry game for is kind of a more interesting contest, since the level difference between the teams isn't quite as significant, (plus both teams are prone to random fails.) Dignitas had a rather interesting January, where they offered flashes of Top-Tier play. The high point so far being their performances at DH Leipzig, with wins over [Mouseports] and Virtus.Pro with the BO3 format featured. They then earned their place here following another 2-0 sweep of Mouz. Additionally they'll have the added benefit of that recent Lan experience, compared to the Ukranians. FlipSid3 on the other hand, have surely been the less consistent of the two, with mixed results over the short term. They achieved a notable sweep vs Penta, but lost/draw to teams below the 3rd Tier. So its hard to determine what to expect from them here, particularly since this will be their first Lan competition since Shara became their fifth player. As far as the Veto goes, there are good chances we'll watch de_mirage, de_overpass, and de_inferno. Assuming these are the selected maps, the Danes will be advantaged on Mirage and Overpass, while Inferno could go either way. This is surely reflected in the current Betting Odds, which (while still moving) are trending the favor of Danish side. With consideration to the glimmers of highend gameplay they achieved over the short term, we're in agreement. So as long as the percentages remain decent for a Low Bet on Dignitas, they're our pick. But again, this is a matchup watch for a possible ICB on F3, should the odds surpass 80/20 mark.
http://csgo.guru/match/3578!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7984!$Penta!$Ence!$Ence!$0.42!$0.23!$0.18999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The only EU 'ranked' match we'll enjoy today, and also a pretty interesting one since this is the first real test for the ENCE new lineup, now featuring Allu. In their previous couple of low-end matches, the Finns managed to take home two easy victories, but honestly we're not prone in considering those games as really relevant. Penta on the other hand, are surely a way more serious opponent. However, over the short-term, the German mix delivered a kinda disappointing set of mixed results. Right now they are looking pretty inconsistent and quite momentum based, so nailing their current level isn't easy at all. Against HR they showed some decent things but failed to close the game in the long run. While against Efrag and FlipSid3, they failed to provide any fight at all, so we have serious doubts about their condition in BO3 contests. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_mirage, de_inferno and de_dust2. If this is how the veto goes, Mirage can easily go either ways, while Inferno should be in favor of Penta, and Dust2 should go to ENCE. Betting odds are pretty skewed in favor of the Finnish side, and we kind of agree since they are without a doubt the more reliable pick. However the current percentages aren't really amazing and are still moving a lot, so even if our choice is a Low+ bet on ENCE, we suggest to wait a bit and eventually skip (or ICB on Penta) if the values will reach or pass the 20/80 threshold.

Penta are heading here after a pretty disappointing week, with just a couple of low-end victories in their bag, additionally they're playing with Fel1x instead of TabseN again, which won't make things aany better. Particularly when considering the issues that this roster seems to experience in most of their BO2/BO3 matches. On the other hand, SK have been cruising in safe waters for several months now, and the current lineup is pretty solid and balanced. They are rolling into this game carrying a decent winning streak, after a good run at DH Leipzig too. Overall we're getting good vibes from them, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Danes pull off a plain 2-0 sweep. Betting odds are quite skewed in favor of SK, but honestly they are the most reliable pick, so we're oriented in going Low+/Avg- on them, however keep an eyes on the percentages and eventually skip if they hit the 15/85 threshold (values are still moving a lot).

ALTERNATE aTTaX turned out to be a pretty serious contender, and they're actually the 2nd best German team right after Mouz. Overall their level seems a couple of steps ahead Penta, and the current roster is quite young and motivated, so we're expecting them to improve even further by the end of the current Quarter. In the short-term, the Germans put up good contests against Astralis and SK, plus they managed to beat E-Frag, so today they should be able to play on par with the Polish side. Vexed had several relatively rough weeks. They are still carrying their famous (or infamous) inconsistency against low-end teams, so they keep having issues in taking home what on paper should be really easy games. On the other hand, they somehow step-up and turn into a Tier-2 team as soon as they meet a serious opponent. Due to this kind of behavior, guessing how they'll play today is extremely hard, but honestly we don't believe we'll watch them taking more than a single map. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, but overall a bit too much in favor of the Polish side, so at our end we're prone towards attempting a Low pick on ALTERNATE aTTaX in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages. Even though we'll likely watch just a Tie.

SPLYCE continues their push to break into the NA Mid-Tier, and seem to piecing together fairly balanced contests on par with Low-Mid Tier teams. Actually none of their games recently exposed any serious issues, but on a map-to-map basis, their consistency is still a little suspect. But they're very emotional in their gameplay, which can both work to their advantage as well as be a detriment. So some stabilized leadership may be a critical component in their progressing forward. NRG on the other hand, sports a little more firepower but the roster surely needs more time/experience together to evolve as a solid team. They achieved mixed results in their recent matches, but demonstrated their potential against NME a few days back with an strong 2-0 sweep. They then followed that up with a stellar 16-3 Cobblestone over WinterFox, before reaching a draw after an even 2nd Map. So they're a slight step ahead of their American counterparts, but the sporadic outings make this game kinda random. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor of NRG, which is correct due to the more dangerous EU/NA mix. On our end, we're inclined to agree, but randomness factor of this matchup combined with the Tie-prone BO2, we're moreso oriented towards chasing the more rewarding percentages (whichever direction they may go). So while the payoff is greater, our pick is Low Bet on SPLYCE, but this is basically a coin toss, so keep the values Low.

FlipSid3 were defeated by Dignitas in quite a quick 2-0 sweep, and honestly they looked a bit rusty and very 'slow' in adjusting during the early phase of the maps. They still managed to provide a consistent mid-late game, but overall this is not a solid way to play, and this way will not be conducive taking home a BO3. On the other hand, CLG managed to put up a pretty good show versus EnvyUs in the morning. The North American side stepped up a bit compared to how they closed the 2015, and actually their playstyle is resembling one similar to that of Liquid. And this is a good thing since they played for months without a real 'soul', but mostly relying on their personal skill, so having a plan is surely a step forward for them. About maps, we believe we'll watch: de_mirage, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto goes this way, Mirage should be in favor of FSid3, while Overpass may go in favor of CLG and Train is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of CLG, and even if we believe that they are slightly advantaged we shouldn't forget that we're talking about a LAN match and scores are generally closer than expected. So onour end, we're oriented more towards attempting a Low- pick on FlipSid3 in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages. But well, this is a risky pick on an overall a risky match, so avoid high values.

EnVyUs didn't perform their very best in their entry game early this morning, and after a pretty poor showing on the first map, they had to climb back to hit a 2-1 victory. But still not in an easy fashion. So overall they looked way more shaky than expected. On the other hand, Dignitas delivered a convincing 2-0 sweep over FlipSid3. They started both maps pedal to the metal, achieving heavy scores by the end of the first halves. They then mostly controlled the game, but allowed the CIS-based side to come back a bit prior to closing the game. (Basically the Danes played the 2nd halfs almost strats-less). About maps we believe we'll watch: de_mirage, de_train and de_cache. If this is the veto, EnVyUs should be favored on both Mirage and Cache, while Train may go to Dignitas. Betting odds are still moving a lot, but they are obviously trending in favor of the French side, and honestly this is kinda correct since Dignitas always have had serious issues in dealing with T1 teams, with very few exceptions. Our pick is a Low+/Avg- bet on EnVyUs.

There isn't much to say about Cloud9. Over the short-term, the North American side didn't really play on a regular basis, and even less on the International field. Additionally this is their first LAN event with Stewie2K instead of SeanG@res. Overall we've serious concerns about their current form, and about their capability to deal with the rest of the Tier-1 teams without invested time with proper training (they didn't play a lot during most of the Winter season). Basically they're a pretty big question mark, so at the momeny we don't really find them to be a reliable choice. On the other hand, Gamers2 are the former [Titan] squad, who've always been quite an inconsistent team. Despite their roster, which features several really talented players, they never really managed to provide any solid shows over time, and typically they're prone to experiencing somewhat random peaks, directly followed by some terrible lows, so predicting how they'll play today is surely not an easy task at all. However, it is worth noting that they've managed to find a new home, so they might express themselves a bit better than during their most recent troubled month with Titan, so we have hopes slightly higher than usual. As for the maps, our opinion is we'll watch: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass. Should the veto go this way, both Dust2 and Overpass can easily go either way, while Cobblestone should be in favor of G2. Betting odds are still fairly balanced, and this is correct since we're talking about a match filled by question marks. But honestly we don't really find C9 a reliable pick due to the low number of official matches played as currently constructed. So we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Gamers2, hoping to see them freshly inspired and a bit more in form than in their latest exits.

EnVyUs ended here after a shocking loss against Dignitas, and honestly we were quite surprised to see the Frenchmen losing 2-0, particularly when playing in such a horrible way. Surely their entry game against CLG didn't go amazingly well either, but we were expecting them to improve in the following contest, instead they ended up in the dust. So honestly, now we really wouldn't be surprised to watch them have issues again in the Decider match. On the other hand CLG after the loss in their entry game, had to find their way through FlipSid3, but they evetually gained some traction and dismissed them in a quick 2-0 sweep (even if the first map was really close). According to what we watched so far, the North American side seemed capable of setting up something serious in this game, especially since Envy aren't really looking near their usual form. About the maps, we'll likely watch: de_cache, de_train and de_inferno. If this is how the veto goes, both Cache and Inferno may be pretty close, while Train should be in favor of Envy. Betting odds are really skewed, and they're still moving a lot because of the late-schedule. So even if our pick is a Low+ bet on EnVyUs (we highly doubt they'll go packing this early), we highly suggest evaluating a skip, in particular because the percentages right now are moving around kinda nonsense values (85/15).

Astralis are headed here after mowing down Method in extremely easy fashion ,and with kinda embarrassing scores. But well, we can't consider their entry game to be all that relevant since they hadn't previously competed against any relevant opponents. Basically the whole contest went just as expected, so this match will be their first 'real' one at the GEC Finals. In the short-term the Danes they have done fairly well. But overall, they haven't yet managed to re-reach their top form. So right now they're basically hanging in 'Limbo', with the possibility of resulting in them having issues dealing with the former Titan squad. On the other hand, Gamers2 managed to roll past Cloud9 after a pretty tight contest. Essentially, the North American side were mostly paying the consequences of having not attended any events in January. That coupled with the lack of training during most of the Winter Season. However, the Frenchmen looked pretty solid, and their results were surely encouraging. Over the past few weeks, they had also put up good shows against NiP and Fnatic, so if they can manage to stay focused, they could become a serious threat to the Danish side. About the maps, we believe we'll watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto goes this way, both Dust2 and Train may go either way, while Overpass should be in favor of Astralis. Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of the Danes, but currently the values are still moving a lot, so we suggest waiting a bit prior to making your pick. Anyway, on our end, even if we find Astralis advantaged, we're slightly more oriented in trying our luck with a Low pick on Gamers2, in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages. With the hope to watch the Frenchmen setting up one of their AAA game.

LDLC White are rolling into this match after edging out a shocking defeat in their entry game, where they narrowly escaped Epiphany by a close 16-14 score. The French side have always been kinda inconsistent during these past months, never having really been a reliable pick. But sometimes they do manange to put up a strong outing and deliver a good show. Now today, based on their start, it is not going to be one of those days. ENCE on the other hand, are surely one of the big favorites of the event. Their new lineup featuring Allu is looking pretty strong as they sit on a decent winning streak, in addition they are also moving through the Tier-3 in a decent fashion. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+/Avg- pick on ENCE, so we're oriented in taking this path since the Finns are looking way more reliable than LDLC.
http://csgo.guru/match/3639!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8011!$SK!$Ence!$SK!$0.52!$0.61!$-0.08999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Kind of an unusual Online match-up since ENCE are currently attending Assembly Winter, so they'll play physically together, which could be a good plus in favor of the Finns, particularly since we're talking about quite a relevant game where the winner will be awarded a spot at the MLG Columbus LAN Qualifier. However today they played just a couple of low-tier BO1s, and the second one was even closer than expected. So we're not too impressed so far, but overall we're prone to considering them a decent threat in games featuring the BO3 format. On the other hand SK is moving here after a 2-0 sweep over Empire, a match where they had to sweat a bit more than expected. Overall it seems that their momentum slowed down a bit during the last two weeks. In the short-term, they are having more issues than usual in dealing with teams that they used to beat in early January. About the maps, we're expecting: de_mirage, de_dust2 and de_cbble. Should the veto go this way, ENCE should have an edge on Mirage, while SK will likely take Cobblestone, leaving Dust2 that will be a pure 50/50 contest. Betting odds are currently a bit skewed in favor of SK, but honestly we're talking about a game that is quite balanced, where ENCE can take advantage of the bootcamp, so our pick is a Low bet on the Finnish side.

However not really the most exciting matchup, since the Cloud9 we've seen in this event is surely a step down from the team putting up mostly consistent Top-Tier performances towards the mid-2015. The addition Stewie2k was expected to challenge their form moving forward, but their greatest weakness seems to stem from their lack of practice and recent competition. Above all else, their struggles on T-side are becoming more obvious as the weekends moves forward. Ultimately, aside from Method, they dont look prepared to compete with any T1 teams currently. And honestly, in the current form, should be strongly outmatched by the Frenchmen. Meanwhile, EnVyUs appear to be gaining momentum after the humbling rude awakening of the 0-2 defeat at the hands of Dignitas. Granted, the French-side is sometimes prone to the random fails (moreso in the recent Quarter). But KennyS and co. returned from that loss to eventually storm past CLG in the Decider, closing the second two maps 16-4. Plus the French often grow more dangerous as the stakes rise, so we're not expecting them to face any serious issues in sending the Americans packing. As for the Maps, we believe theres good chances we'll watch de_train, de_cache, and de_cbble. However, historically C9 has had the upper hand in the H2Hs, but these two haven't faced each other in several months, so their match data isn't too reliable. So realistically, in their current form, the French should be advantaged on all three, but Train would be the closest to even map. Betting Odds almost immediately went to trash, heavily favoring EnvyUs. As outlined above, we in agreement with this. Short of a random French fail, we feel the strat deficiency of C9 is too great to take two maps from the French. With these percentages our EnvyUs pick would offer little reward, so we're inclined to skip. Especially since C9 hasn't shown anything to suggest they could pull off an ICB-worthy upset.
http://csgo.guru/match/3643!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8038!$CLG!$G2!$CLG!$0.4!$0.26!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The playoffs are underway for the GEC Finals, as we move forward with our second match of the day, and the second Quarter Final. This one however might be a somewhat closer matchup than the first contest. CLG had little action in January, so our expectations from them this weekend were limited. After a shaky entry game against a subpar EnVyUs squad, the Americans managed set up some good thing against FlipSid3 to avoid elimination. But their moment of promise was quickly torn down in the second meeting with Envy in the Decider match. Now, with the stakes raised, they'll face elimination once more. The players formerly of Titan, Gamers2, seemed to be meshing better as the day progressed. They achieved wins in both games versus the other NA representative Cloud9, (the second more convincing than the first), and came within OT of beating Astralis in the Winner's match. Actually their failure to close out the Danes on Cache when they had the lead, is partly why they're in this game. But honestly, it may have made their road to the finals more 'doable'. This will actually be the first time these two have competed, which is surprising considering how active they were last year. Both teams have substantial experience in matches featuring the extended map-pool, as well as competing locally. About maps, we'll likely watch de_cbble, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, Overpass may go either ways, while both Cobblestone and Train should be in favor of G2. Current Betting Odds are rolling in favor of the Frenchmen. On our end, we feel the North Americans have their work cut out for them, particularly since G2 is entering on high note, so although CLG will likely force a third map, we see shox and friends as the more reliable pick for a Low+/Avg- bet.

Yesterday evening, ENCE displayed their limits against SK, in a game we honestly were expecting a much better show from the Finns. Instead they were defeated in a quick 2-0 sweep (minus the ping-issue delays), without setting up anything decent. Its worth noting that they experienced some latency issues, but still they should have delivered more. However, as for Assembly, they haven't provided anything impressive in their entry BO1s either, and both matches against the French sides ended closer than expected. So right now we are a bit concerned about their level. On the other hand, CPH Wolves didn't experience a better run, and after suffering a shocking loss in their opening match versus LDLC Blue, they finally woke up, and dismissed both RCTIC and the former PixelFire squad. The Danes are actually looking a bit more reliable than ENCE, but honestly they never really impressed too much in the BO3 format, so we've doubts about picking them in a contest featuring the extended map-pool. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_mirage. If the veto goes this way, Cobblestone should be in clear favor of CPHW, while ENCE may grab Mirage, and Dust2 can go either ways. Betting odds are trending in favor of ENCE, and even if this is correct, the current percentages are a bit too skewed, and we'll likely enjoy a pretty close game, in particular if we see the maps above. So on our end, we're oriented in attempting a Low pick on CPH Wolves in order to take advantage of the more rewarding values.

Astralis had an extremely easy opening match, where they dismissed Method with a super quick 2-0 sweep, losing just 5 rounds in the process. Unfortunately for them, the winner's game followed a way different pattern, and they had to use all their aces in order to take down Gamers2, honestly the Frenchmen missed several great chances to close the match early. So Astralis are moving into this Semi with some serious scars on their faces. On the other hand, EnVyUs are one of the teams that disappointed us the most during the past two days. They faced no issues in dealing with the North American sides (even if the double 2-1 vs CLG rang some bells), but they were quickly grounded as soon as the competition turned serious, and they had to face Dignitas. The Danes basically demolished Envy. The scores were pretty embarrassing too and overall Envy looked totally lost and unable to set up their strats. However, talking about the current match, in our opinion we'll watch: de_inferno, de_mirage and de_cache. On paper a pretty balanced set of maps, with Envy advantaged on Inferno, Astralis on Cache and Mirage being 'neutral' ground. Betting odds are still in the middle, and this is correct since we're talking about a super-balanced (though quite risky) Tier-1 match. However, based on what we watched so far, we find Astralis as a slightly more reliable pick than Envy, so we're oriented in going Low on them.

Gamers2 were one of the favorites for advancing into this Semi and for possibly taking the trophy as well. But instead CLG sent them packing. However, it's kinda cool that the two 'dark horses' of this event will meet and battle for a spot in the Grand-Final. CLG, out of the two, is surely had to sweat more, due to the early defeats at the hands of EnVyUs, but what they managed to put up today against G2 is surely a promising sign. On pape they'll now have to face a roster slightly below the level of the French, so it'll be quite interesting to see if they manage to keep their momentum. On the other hand, Dignitas hit the Semi-Final after beating FlipSid3 in their entry game, and then by shocking EnVyUs in a pretty impressive game, delivering an amazing 2-0. This is surely a more stunning result compared to what CLG achieved. But still they played less matches, which means that they may enter this game a bit 'colder' than the North Americans. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cbble, de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto goes this way, Overpass should be in favor of CLG, while Dignitas may grab Mirage, leaving Cobblestone which will be a pretty hard contest since both lineups tend to delivered good things on it. Betting odds are still moving a lot, so we suggest to wait a bit prior placing bets, but overall at our end we're a bit more oriented in going for a Low pick on Dignitas, mostly because of they've shown more consistency on lan recently.
http://csgo.guru/match/3650!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8043!$LDLC.White!$Ence!$LDLC.White!$0.45!$0.25!$0.2!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Assembly Winter in Helsinki has arrived at its Grand-Final, in what should be a fairly balanced matchup. Not much time before game start, so we got to be brief. LDLC White didn't have the toughest path to follow in reaching the final. Particularly compared to their Finnish counterparts. In fact their only serious obstacle to face are the rematch they're now in. But in that contest, the BO1 format didn't allow the Frenchmen the opportunity to redeem the close loss they suffered in their first encounter. ENCE on the other hand, had an easy time once they woke up, but they could partially be attributed the fact the Finns were splitting their time locally and online in the MLG pre-qualifier. That game served ENCE up a hot dish of humility, in a serious beatdown served by SK. The hometown favorites for Assembly, responded to that poor performance in furious fashion, as they steamrolled CPH Wolves. Now they surely look poised to close the event on a high note. As far as the Veto goes, theres good chances we'll see de_cache, de_dust2, and de_cbble. Should the Veto go this way, ENCE will have an edge on Cobblestone, but Dust and Cache could go either way. On our end, we're mostly aligned with Current Odds trending in favor of a hometown win. Especially have how easily they handled the CPHW early today. Additionally, the Frenchmen haven't really been tested, particulaly with ENCE closer to form. So our pick is Low+ on Allu and friends to keep the momentum going.

Nobody prior to DAY 1 could have guessed that Dignitas were so pumped up and ready for this event, and watching them in a match like this is surely impressive and means that the Danes took their task to improve pretty seriously. This is even more impressive since teams such as Astralis and Gamers2 (that were the big favorites) failed to reach the Final, so despite how this match will go, we've to congratulate to Dignitas for their effort and hard work. Anyway, talking about the game it self, obviously the Danes aren't the favored team. EnVyUs finally woke up after a couple of days below their average. Yesterday they looked extremely fine against Astralis, and we're pretty sure they didn't use all their tricks yet, so we could watch the Frenchmen even more on-point in this match compared to the Semi-Final. Despite this, its worth noting that Dignitas improved a lot on the extended-map pool, and a good veto may give them an hand in delivering some serious troubles to Envy. So we're talking about a game with several variables and that might still provide real surprises. Additionally, during DAY 1 Dignitas managed to roll over Envy with a plain 2-0 sweep and with kinda embarrassing scores, so this means that the Danes have some clue about how to counter the French strats. About maps, we'll probably watch: de_train, de_cbble, de_mirage, de_cache and de_inferno. If we watch this set of maps, Envy should be a step ahead on both Mirage, Cache &amp; Cobblestone, while Dignitas may take Train and Inferno may go either way. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on EnVyUs, and as we stated above we don't believe that KennyS and friends revealed all their stuff yet, so we're oriented in sticking with them, even if we would be extremely happy to watch Dignitas finally hitting the Tier-1.

However, there are $30K available for the 3rd place and $20K for the 4th, so the $10K difference is quite appealing so we might watch a pretty close game. Astralis were our pick for the Grand-Finals, but Envy decided to comeback from hell and delivered an amazing show in the Semi-Finals, sending the Danes into this contest, despite they had a better run during the first days of the event. Surely Device and the gang are joining this match as favored, and overall they should be fairly advantaged by the BO3 format. On the other hand CLG despite not being the most consistent team out there, played a couple of really great matches, in particular the one that sent Gamers2 to packing. Overall they provided a way better show than what we were expecting prior DAY 1, and we are surely happy to see them slowly regaining their form and improving match after match, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch CLG taking a map and putting up a good fight. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_overpass, de_mirage and de_dust2. If the veto will go so, Astralis should have an edge on Overpass, while both Mirage and Dust2 should be pretty balanced. Betting odds are already kinda off, and percentages are floating around 85/15, so we're not talking about profitable values and then going with Astralis is kinda pointless. You can either skip and enjoy the match or attempt a YOLO ICB on CLG hoping for an upset, at our end we're more oriented in taking the 2nd path.

PENTA are experiencing issues since their last lineup changes, and the current roster is having hard times in playing on par with most of the other Tier-3 teams. Since we're talking about a BO2 we don't really believe that the German mix will be able to take home both maps, and on paper the best they can achieve is a Tie. On the other hand, E-Frag are surely more consistent than Penta, they displayed slightly better things and even skill-wise they always looked a step ahead, however we can't say that their latest results are encouraging. The defeats versus [Ancients] and HellRaisers should ring some bells, since we're talking about teams that were supposed to be manageable by the Bulgarians. Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of E-Frag, they surely have a clear edge, and we highly doubt they'll lose both maps, but honestly we cannot really advice to waste time in placing bets when odds are floating around 85/15 percentages, in particular in a week filled by pretty great match-ups. So our main pick is a skip, but if you want to go for a side just stick with E-Frag.

ALTERNATE aTTaX is one of the teams we're following closely, and honestly they are looking really promising, aside from their latest results we've to note that they provided serious troubles to teams such as Astralis and FaZe (even if they ended losing), so gameplay-wise we're talking about a Tier-2 roster than can provide serious headaches, even if they still need to train properly on the extended map-pool. However, here we're talking about a BO2 contest, so the Germans should be able to take home at least a map and hit a Tie. On the other hand, CPH Wolves aren't too bad. They surely played in a kinda disappointing way against ENCE on Saturday, during Assembly, and the scores were kinda crazy, but after-all we're talking about a team mostly composed by hard-workers rather than crazy skilled players, and generally this kind of players are capable of a 'save the day' with a Tie in matches featuring this format. Overall we're talking about a pretty balanced match, and betting odds are still quite aligned too, but at our end we're a bit more oriented in giving an edge to the German side, so our pick is a Low on ALTERNATE aTTaX.

This is going to be a pretty interesting game not just because both roster know each other pretty well, but also because these teams share a very similar veto pattern. Dignitas are rolling into this BO3 after an amazing run at GameShow Finals in Lithuania, where against all odds, they managed to reach the Grand-Final before being dismissed by EnVyUs with a quick 3-0 score. We can't deny that what Dignitas achieved in Vilnius has been a really nice surprise, and we're happy to see them finally heading in right direction, pushing their way up to Tier-1, after almost a year of sitting in the top spots of Tier-2. On the other hand SK are doing pretty well too. Over the past several weeks they've assembled a long streak of good performances, even if they mostly faced low-tier teams. Anyway, as we already stated, this is a 'local' match, so in these kind of games scores are always quite close. And we're pretty sure that SK will be able to grab a map and force map3. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cbble, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto goes this way, SK should have an edge on Mirage, while Cobblestone will likely go in favor of Dignitas, and Overpass is going to be 50/50. Current betting odds are way too skewed in favor of Dignitas. Honestly this isn't really correct, since International matches don't follow the same pattern of Local ones. So even if Dignitas are surely advantaged, the current 80/20 percentages are kinda nonsense, so on our end, we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on SK, with the hope of watching an upset.

Astralis enter this week after their trip to Vilnius for the GameShow Finals, where there finished in 3rd place. They had a decent weekend, but their loss to EnVyUs prevented them from reaching the Grand-Final. So they were tasked with CLG for 3/4 seed, and the Danes stormed through the North Americans with easy fashion in an incredibly fast 2-0 sweep. Overall, the Danish roster has played close to form in the early stages of the year, about the time they started their own org. Natus Vincere on the other hand, have been idle since grabbing their first trophy of the year at DH Leipzig. Though all of the T1 didn't participate, NaVi still went undefeated, including sweeps over Dignitas and LG. They just won't be quite as fresh as the Danish-side. As for this contest and the first game of the season, Mirage will host the battle, a map that the has historically gone in favor of the Guardian and friends. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of NAVI as well, primarily due to the map history. But real-world are around 50/50, particularly considering the teams' recent schedule activity. On our end, we're leaning towards going for Natus Vincere too, they aren't the fresher team, but honestly they always managed to deliver good shows in Mirage, so they're our pick for Low Bet.

We've already discussed the DH Leipzig prize Natus Vincere grabbed in late January. That followed up at respectable showing for StarSeries XIV Finals, where they made their first Grand-Final appearance of the year, but the moment was all Fnatic's, and a very disappointing end for GuardiaN and the gang. However, NaVi did achieve a 2-1 victory over the Danes (playing as TQM/ex-TSM) in the Quarter-Finals. Astralis on the other hand, finished 2015 on rough patch, mainly due to org-related issues. But pretty much since SSXIV, the Danes have gradually but consistently showing signs of improvement. They're still not quite to their full form, but they're surely competing again at T1 level, as we saw in the battle with NV. The second map draw for this contest is Overpass, which gives advantage to the Astralis, which is in line with Current Betting Odds trending in their favor. Since this is not one the maps NaVi placed too much focus on, and one of the best maps for the Danes, Astralis is our pick for Low Bet. Anyway, worth reminding that this kind of top-tier BO1s are pretty hard to predict, since they don't follow a real pattern, but they are kinda momentum based.
http://csgo.guru/match/3658!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8070!$DenDD!$ATN!$ATN!$0.45!$0.39!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Honestly not the most predictable matchup on today's schedule. DenDD are mostly a mix, who even though, on paper, they can surely deliver some damage and several of their players are experiencing a pretty good form (IE: Dumas and Bendji), we still have concerns about their consistency as team. Generally, they tend to struggle against well organized rosters, particularly in games featuring the extended map-pool. So we might watch them take a map, but we don't believe they'll manage to take home the whole match. On the other hand, ALTERNATE aTTaX aren't doing too bad. Lately they've turned into some kind of Tie-Masters, and they keep hitting 1-1 scores in most of the BO2s around. This is a surely promising sign, because suggests they are solid, but it also means that they have serious issues in closing matches. And this may turn into a real problem if a veto goes wrong. About this match, we're expecting to watch: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass. If the veto goes this way, Cobblestone should be in favor of ATN, while both Dust2 and Overpass may go either way. Betting odds are still decent for a Low pick on ALTERNATE aTTaX, the path we're oriented towards following, since we find them slightly more reliable than DenDD.

Envy are just back from Vilnius where they grabbed the GameShow League trophy, after dominating Dignitas in the Grand-Final. Overall the Frenchmen looked a bit 'slow' in the first couple of days in Lithuania, but then woke up and provided some really outstanding performances. However generally EnVyUs trend to overlook a bit low-tier matches like this one, in particular BO1s, but honestly in their entry game they're playing on de_mirage, a map where they won all their matches since the new year, so we've quite good hopes. Worth nothing that Mirage is a decent map for SK as well, here the Danes managed to beat Luminosity at DH Leipzig, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them starting to the pedal to the metal, even if during the mid-late game we'll likely watch Envy coming back. Betting odds are still quite decent for a Low+ pick on EnVyUs, so we're oriented in sticking with them, with the hope to watch them keeping their streak.

Here the Frenchmen always provided good shows and always been one of their best maps, so unless huge surprises they should be able to take it home without sweating too much. On the other hand SK used to be decent, but still aligned to the Tier-2/3 level, so even if on Cobblestone lately they managed to deliver a couple of close games, and almost hit the OT versus Dignitas, their level should be way below the Envy one. Betting odds are still moving a lot, but at our end we're oriented in going Avg on EnVyUs, mostly because we don't see many chances for the Danes.
http://csgo.guru/match/3661!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8086!$Renegades!$NME!$Renegades!$0.45!$0.6!$-0.14999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving into the NA portion of today's schedule, to begin with a fairly interesting AU/NA battle. This will pretty much be the first relevant match we'll watch Renegades compete in this year. In their several sub-T3 contests, the Aussies have mostly faired well. However, just earlier we learned the team released Havoc, and replaced him with USTILO, who had been a standin for Immunity since the 2nd Quarter of 2015. Granted the similarity of the local AU playstyles will help make the transition seamless. But they're both close to the same level skill-wise, so over time it shouldn't have too much impact on the teams overall performance, beyond the early stages of the lineup shuffle. Enemy on the other hand, continues to be the inconsistent mystery we saw from them in the second half of '15. They handled Games Academy who'd been amongst the best T3 teams this year. But then they followed that up with a loss to SPLYCE last night, after failing on the second 2 maps of the Winter Classic UB Final. This was another game NME let get away from them after taking control of the momentum earlier in the contest. Now, yet again, we're starting to see the same up-and-down pattern they seemed to have broken away from in January. As for this contest on Train, on paper, the Australians should have slight edge. However, with consideration to the roster change, we feel that map benefit is negated. Particularly since Train is not a map the AU teams have focused much in the short-term. Additionally, this will be the first test for the Renegades against a team on par with them. So on our end, we're oriented towards taking advantage of the more rewarding percentages, and expect NME to continue their pattern to followup yesterday's loss with a win. So Enemy is our pick for Low Bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/3662!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8091!$NME!$Renegades!$NME!$0.48!$0.41!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Now we move to the 2nd map of this EPL contest. As we discussed on the first map, the consistency concerns for Enemy are rising to the surface once again. they entering today's contests following an uninspired loss to SPLYCE yesterday, in a game they were on path to sweep midway through Cobblestone. For this second game, they'll surely have their work cut out for them, since Mirage hasn't been one their stronger maps. Today is the first relevant contest we'll see from Renegades, so we're still a little unsure about what to expect from them, and where their current form is. For this game however, they will surely benefit from the map. The Aussies have historically set up some really good things on Mirage. And even though USTILO is replacing Havoc, Mirage was a map IMTY focused on as well, so the shuffle variable should have a lesser impact. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Australians. Which is correct, particularly based on the abovementioned map experience. So with percentages still rewarding, our pick is Low Bet on Renegades.

AGG, previously known as SKDC, moved to AGG a couple of weeks ago after completing a couple of light lineup changes. However, despite the new name, we need to remember that they never really excelled on de_cache, and this has always been a map where they've experienced serious issues. On the other hand OpTiC are one of the NA teams that are doing better in the grand scheme of things. And even if they've slowed down down a lot in the short-term, compared to early-mid January, we're still talking about a roster fielding a pretty good amount of firepower. Additionally, they used to be quite decent on Cache, and also a good step ahead AGG. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on OpTiC, so we're oriented in sticking with them.

Games Academy were bumped from the Winner's Bracket in a close 2-1 loss to Enemy, and then survived Tectonic to remain in the tournament. Aside from the NME loss, the Brazilians have been playing exceptionally fielding a consistency and form on par with Tier 2. Meanwhile, WinterFox was also demoted from the winner's bracket, but their UB Semi was not as tight a contest as GA. Wfx was swept by SPLYCE in a very disappointing show by Desi and co. The form we were growing accustom to seeing from Wfx has waivered some in in the short term, and we're seeing some of the inconsistency they were plagued by last year while the lineup was still split across two continents. making this quite a test. The current Betting Odds are favoring the Brazilian-side, which is correct, particularly when considering a head-to-head history of these two. The LG-alike playstyle of the GA, is one Wfx has yet to really counter. On our end, we're mostly in agreement, and moreso oriented in following this trend for Low Bet on Games Academy. But this is a risky pick with random BO1 element, so we suggest waiting to watch the percentages, and be sure to keep values Low.
http://csgo.guru/match/3667!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8060!$Splyce!$NME!$Splyce!$0.48!$0.25!$0.22999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Pretty decent matchup to finish up the NA schedule tonight, for the Winter Classic II Upper-Bracket final. A week ago SPLYCE put up a strong outing by way of a 2-0 sweep of WinterFox in the UB Semi, advancing to this game. But in the two T3 CounterPit contests since, the results have digressed. Now they come into this game fresh off a very poor showing where NRG held them to 11 rounds across 2 maps. So we've some serious concerns about their consistency. Enemy on the other hand, have not played since their Semi-Final last week, where they setup some really decent strats to defeat Games Academy. Its worth noting that the Brazilians had been tearing through the 3rd Tier prior to that, including their previous meetings. So that was sure to be confidence boost for an NME squad who've been wavering some after an above-par beginning to the year. As for the Maps, we believe we'll watch de_cache, de_mirage,and de_overpass. Assuming the Veto goes this way, Mirage and Cache will favor NME, and SPLYCE will have an advantage on Overpass. This is reflected in the Current Betting Odds rolling in favor of Enemy. Especially after what they managed vs GA. At our end we're oriented in following that path. So Enemy are our pick for Low Bet while percentages are still decent.

The Russian roster is just back from GameShow Finals, where they suffered two 2-0 losses, ending their journey in Lithuania after just a couple of days. As we already stated in the previous game, E-frag in the short-term slowed down their run a bit, the Bulgarians experienced a couple of kinda heavy losses, however they should be still fairly advantaged in this game, and we doubt we'll watch them dropping more than a map in this BO3. About Method, worth noting that they may perform a bit better than expected, back in Vilnius they had a quite horrible entry game, but the following one versus Cloud9 turned into a pretty tight contest, and even if it ended 2-0 the map scores were respectable and tighter than everybody was expecting. Talking about the current match, we'll likely watch: de_cache, de_dust2 and de_overpass. If the veto will go so, E-frag should have an edge on Dust2 and Overpass, while Cache could be more even. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+/Avg- pick on E-frag, so we're oriented in taking this path, mostly because the BO3 format should give them an hand.

During the past couple of weeks Astralis didn't really play a lot on de_inferno, but don't let this fool you, because they used to play it a lot during their TSM/TQM times (so prior renaming into Astralis in late Jan.), and you can easily check this by our own match-history (which doesn't reset at every team name change). Basically we're talking about a roster that always provided top3 shows on this maps, and even today we're quite confident about what they can put up in this game. On the other hand Gamers2, the former Titan squad, displayed promising things at GameShow Finals in Lithuania, and at some point they were also about to beat Astralis, but instead they ended choking in OT and shortly after they ended the whole event with a kinda terrible loss to CLG. So overall they are still pretty inconsistent and prone to fails. However, here we're talking about BO1s, so they should be able to keep the focus more than a BO3 and eventually surprise. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, so we don't see any reason for risking a pick on Gamers2 when the Danes looked way more consistent and reliable, so we're going with a Low bet on Astralis.

Compared to Inferno which has been played in the opening match, on Cache the differences between the two roster shouldn't be too relevant, and overall we're talking about a pretty balanced and extremely risky game. Last weekend in Vilnius, Lithuania during GameShow Finals, this map provided several issues to Astralis, here they lost against EnVyUs and ended in OT versus Gamers2, but worth noting that G2 wasted several match points, and this isn't something that happens everyday, in particular now that we're talking about BO1s. Generally the Frenchmen always looked pretty good on Cache, obviously they are still prone to random horrible matches, but overall this is one of the few maps where we consider them a reliable pick, and historically they never disappointed us too much on it. Betting odds are again skewed in favor of Astralis, but as we already stated, here we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game, so we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low pick on Gamers2, with the hope to watch them playing as they know.

Both FaZe and Virtus.Pro aren't playing since DH Leipzig, so we're talking about a pretty long while, and then evaluating their current form, in particular in BO1s is going to be really hard. Virtus.Pro basically didn't play any match in 2016 apart the two horrible ones during DH Leipzig, where they lost against both Mouz and Dignitas, something that shocked many, but that honestly was kinda expected due the golden rule "if you don't practice, you cannot win". However, here the map is de_train, and this is a map where the Poles always displayed decent things, so we've higher hopes compared to what they put up in mid-January. On the other hand FaZe didn't really play more than the Polish side, and basically they are in standby since DH Leipzig too. Here the EU mix had a slightly more promising start compared to VP, but the final result was basically the same, since they went home after just 3 matches. Talking about de_train, FaZe used to be quite fine months ago, but lately they stopped providing any relevant performance on this map, so we're prone in believing that their current level is slightly below the VP one. Betting odds are still sitting in the middle, and this is correct. As we already stated this is going to be a kinda hard match to predict, but at our end we're more oriented in giving a little edge to Virtus.Pro, so they are our pick for a Low bet.

In the previous game we already discussed the kinda low-form that both teams are experiencing, and this issue together with the BO1 format used in EPL is surely making these contests really risky. However, here we're talking about de_mirage, one of the usual picks for Virtus.Pro and a map where the Poles always provided pretty good shows. Even if worth noting that back at DH Leipzig they lost it to Dignitas, so according to their current bad form we wouldn't be surprised to watch them struggling again. About FaZe there isn't much to say, they always played this map in a totally random way, and they spaced from winning over Astralis (TSM back in the days) to losing against sub-T3 teams, basically without following any pattern or logic. But honestly this is what you get if you play with a full focus on personal plays instead of serious strats. Overall we're prone in giving (again) a little edge to Virtus.Pro because their wider experience, but we highly suggest to stay Low in values due the really high risk.

We're not entirely sure what to expect from these rosters, who both underwent some changes during the NA shuffle, combined with their inactivity since mid December. The coL team we followed last year has been marked dead since the 3/5 players departed from the team. So to begin the new year, the currently constructed compLexity offers us little to reference till they get a some matches in the bag. And honestly we're not expecting much from them in the early stages, especially when compared to the former lineup. Liquid on the other hand, was less impacted by the shuffle, and we see s1mple in place in of FugLy who has gone to CLG. Though this is a step up skill-wise, we've some concerns over the language barrier of adding the Ukrainian to the all-US roster. As for this contest, we're not expecting Liquid to have much trouble here, particularly on Cache, which has always been one of their stronger maps. We're seeing this in the Current Betting Odds as well, skewed in favor of Liquid. On our end we're in agreement, so they're our pick for an Avg- Bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/3688!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8117!$Liquid!$coL!$Liquid!$0.6!$0.7!$-0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second game in a row for both lineups, but aside from seeing what these teams can offer in 2016, not the most interesting matchup out there. As we covered, S1mple is the new addition to the Liquid lineup, but we're unsure about how this will affect the team chemistry. Overall, they didn't end the year in the best of form, and surely hope the refreshed roster will prove to the change needed to push them forward to challenge Top-Tier. CompLexity are also making their first appearances of the year, but for them its mostly as a new team using the old banner. Additionally, the new lineup, on the surface, looks to be a step down from the '15 lineup that deteriorated in the final Quarter of the year. So until they get a few bouts under the belt, our expectations are limited. For the second game, the pre vetoed map is Dust2, which is also one of the maps Liquid focused on in the past. So again, we're not expecting them to face too many issues in taking the game. However, for the map, the percentages are even more skewed in favor of Hiko and friends. So we're more oriented in evaluating a skip for this contest. But if you must pick a side, our pick is Liquid once more.

In the short-term Enemy have started experiencing pretty serious consistency issues, when up till mid-January they were pretty solid and reliable. During the past weeks Relyks and friends surely managed some decent things; their victory over Games Academy is a clear example of the potential of this roster. But then they also collected a good number of relatvely nonsense defeats, such as the game they lost against SPLYCE. So we're actually growing more concerned about them, particularly today, since they are facing a pretty tricky roster. On the other hand NRG are becoming one of the most interesting teams of this first Quarter of the year. The mixed NA/EU lineup is fascinating, who so far has shown promising things, so we'll very likely watch them put up a decent fight. However, talking about the match it self, de_inferno has always been a pretty strong NME map, where we're prone to giving them a slight edge. But honestly, there isn't a consistent set of data for evaluating NRG on this map, so things are surely not written in stone, and the chances for an upset are decent. Betting odds are still balanced, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on Enemy, mostly because we find them a bit more reliable on Inferno.

A map historically kinda inconsistent within the NA scene, where we've frequently seen some relatively surprising upsets. Both teams already faced each other on this map just a week ago, and NRG managed to take home the match by good measure. We're inclined to believing that the EU expertise behind the team may have put them a good step ahead (on this map) of most of the full-American rosters around. However, we should also note that Enemy always been pretty decent on Mirage as well, and aside that match against NRG they've generally achieved good results, even against respectable opponenets, such as Winterfox and Renegades. So we'll likely watch a slightly closer match compared to the one we enjoyed in early February. Betting odds are still decent and quite balanced, but this time our prediction is trending in favor of NRG since we find their EU component more valuable in a game featured on Mirage.

For the second map, we're now moving to de_train. Honestly, there isn't much to say about these teams in relation to this map. AGG basically never played it before, and so there is no data about how they play it. Additionally we don't even know if they've ever trained seriously on Train, (but we have our doubts). On the other hand OpTiC have onlt played it just once, during the Road2Vegas Final in Las Vegas, so on a kinda relevant occasion. On that occassion, they took home both Train and the whole match. But to be fair CSGL weren't really a scary opponent, nor a good team for statistics due to their randomness, especially right after Xmas. So basically we're talking about a kinda unpredictable match, and one where you should seriously evaluate a Skip. Anyways, if you really want to go for a side, OpTiC are obviously a step ahead (skill-wise) compared to AGG, so they should be slightly more reliable.

Following a strong weekend at the GameShow Cup, Dignitas moved back home for the UB Final vs SK. Perhaps fatigue played role, but the Danes weren't quite able to return to their weekend form, and ended with a 2-1 loss to the fellow countrymen. But due to the double elimination format, they'll get one more chance to reach the grand-final. Because of the busy weekend with travel etc. , we're not too concerned by the loss, and overall, Dignitas has been playing a step above their last Quarter level. ALTERNATE aTTaX on the other hand, has been busy in mostly low-end contests with mixed results. Their path here came by way of the LB Final, where they faced DenDD. The Germans barely broke a sweat in dismissing the Swedes in a clean 2-0 sweep yesterday. Overall, the German-side has shown promise, with performances mostly on par with the mid-high T3. Current Betting Odds are already way skewed in favor of Dignitas, which makes sense considering their recent strides, particularly in high-tiered matches, however the Danes will be playing with Maziaz as stand-in for tenzki. This is kinda significant since this is surely a step down for their firepower. So this will cetainly makes this a much more balanced matchup. With that in mind, instead of skipping, we're more oriented towards trying our luck with an ICB on ALTERNATE aTTaX.

Yesterday SK, by taking home the 99DMG Masters trophy over Dignitas, basically added the icing to the cake of 3 weeks they've played extremely well. The roster kept improving match after match, and turned into a serious threat for the whole top Tier-2. At our end we're following SK with a close eye, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them play well today too. However, worth mentioning that the Danes never provided super-exciting shows on Cobblestone, so we've more concerns regarding the map rather than their form. On the other hand Natus Vincere have also been doing really fine since they took home the first big trophy of the year by winning DH Leipzig, and then continued doing well in the following online matches too, failing just once against Astralis. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of NAVI, and this is correct since they've always played Cobblestone in a pretty good fashion, so they should have a clear edge over SK. However, percentages are kinda bad right now, so even if Natus Vincere are our pick for a Low+ bet, we highly suggest to keep an eye on the values and eventually go for an ICB on SK if the odds pass the 82/18 mark.

We already talked about the achievements and form of both teams in the previous match, so we'll just add that we're expecting a closer battle on this map, and we wouldn't be surprised to see close scores. However, Natus Vincere are again advantaged, historically they've always been really great on Train. They clearly demonstrated this at DH Leipzig, where they basically dominated all their opponents on this map. But well, this is an online match, so we might see their performance drop a bit in performances, but they are still quite favored. On the other hand SK displayed good things as well on this map. They destroyed ENCE just few days ago, during the MLG Last Chance Qualifier, so we're expecting them to put up a decent fight, even if their level should still be a step below NAVI. Betting odds are again in favor of GuardiaN and friends, and this is correct based on what they've displayed so far. Percentages are a bit better than the previous game, so we'll stick with a Low+/Avg- bet on Natus Vincere, since we find them more reliable.

Yesterday Virtus.Pro provided an extremely disappointing performance against FaZe, where they ended up losing both maps by measure. Honestly, we were expecting something better from the Polish side, particularly since FaZe were following a kinda similar pattern, having played a low number of matches as well. So they should've been a manageable opponent. But well, things didn't go this way and VP failed to provide a consistent fight, even on Mirage where usually they are more than decent. Today things are getting even more messy, since they're not facing a mid-tier team but Fnatic instead. The Swedes are still on top of the World Ranking and dominated the last 3 Quarters. Additionally they played on a consistent basis to begin the new year as well, so they are stepping here quite advantaged. The map picked for this contest is Dust2, which is an overall balanced map, and also a map where both teams displayed some limits in the past, but honestly the difference in form is actually more relevant than the map it self, so at our end we're prone in going for a Low+ pick on Fnatic (or an ICB on VP if the odds will move to 82/18).

This time the two powerhouses are battling on de_overpass. Honestly, kind of an interesting map pick, particularly since Fnatic started vetoing it on a consistent basis in November. So we don't actually know their current level on it, even if previously (Q2-3 2015) they used to provide good shows here. Compared to Dust2, this is surely a map more prone to an upset, not just because Fnatic stopped playing it a few months back, but also due to the map design and because Virtus.Pro also used to be excel here as well. So we're talking about a game that in our opinion may be way closer than expected, and has a higher potential to deliver surprises. Betting odds are again in favor of Fnatic, which is expected, but honestly these values are way too skewed. As we explained above, on Overpass things should be more balanced, so at our end we're more oriented in trying our luck with a Low- pick on Virtus.Pro, in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

We begin with the first set featuring Cloud9 and CLG, both of which we just saw Vilnius for GEC Finals, now making their first online appearances since. Cloud9 came out of the NA shuffle one significant roster change, Stewie2k replaced seang@res. They surely haven't begun the year in the form they ended year, only managing wins over WinterFox and Method, while falling in their T2+ battles. This includes being swept in their last two contests. But they had been mostly inactive since the break, so we're expecting a little bit more from them moving forward. CLG on other hand, also went through a stretch on off-time prior to GEC, and also didn't achieve the results they hoped for. However, we must say, despite final results of their contests, they mostly put up close fights in all their upper-tiered matches and by the event's conclusion demonstrated they still have the potential to compete at the T2-T1 level. Their biggest challenge though is going to be in closing these matches. Like C9, CLG has put up some good things on de_cbble, so this should make for a pretty balanced matchup. Current Betting Odds are actually slightly skewed in favor of C9, but Real-World Odds are balanced. So while we're slightly more confident in C9 at this point in time, we talking about a map that could go either way. So we're oriented towards trying our luck with a Low pick on CLG.

We've already covered the sub-par results both teams have had in the early stage of the year, during their light schedules. Of the two though, CLG looks to be more in form entering the day's contests. De_overpass has never been a map they've focused on too much, but over the short term they've managed to set up some decent strats earning them wins in couple high level games. Likewise Overpass hasn't been one of preferred maps for Cloud9, but unlike their American counterparts, they haven't quite managed the positive results on it in recent weeks. Generally, they've reached double digits on this map, but constant issues with closing out have kept this map out of their favor. And their T-side issues that plagued them in GEC Finals seem to stand out more on slower maps like this. Its worth noting this is kind of a risky match, particulalrly since C9's potential is slightly higher, and we've really no online matches to gain insight from these teams, just their LAN performances. Regardless, on our end, we're mostly in-line with the current Betting Odds trending favor of CLG. Percentages are still reward for Low Bet on them, so we're inclined to follow that path as well.

Liquid are moving here after an extremely disappointing show against the CompLexity's new roster. Hiko and friends failed to deliver a proper show, and most of what they managed to put up was kinda pug-like, and pretty far from what we were expecting. Just like VP in Europe, Liquid are mostly paying the price for the lack of training during the winter season. But to their credit, they did manage to comeback on Dust to even up the series. On de_overpass they've always been pretty decent, but as stated above, we've serious concerns about their current form. Additionally we can't say that Luminosity are a 'forgiving' team. The Brazilians actually are one of the teams that performed better in this first part of the year. Aside from being pretty consistent on the extended map-pool, they are also sporting rather high form. Additionally, on this map they have taken down teams such as Astralis, so theres no question they know what they're doing right now. Betting odds are trending in favor of Luminosity, and this is correct since they should have a clear edge, so we're oriented towards going for Low+ bet on them as well, since right now we find them way more reliable than Liquid.

We've already addressed the form of both teams in the previous contest, so we'll only add that we don't have much faith Liquid at moment. above all else, they're probably still gonna need some time in order to regain their momentum. But on Cobblestone, we're expecting them to do a bit better than in the entry game, even if Luminosity are generally on-point on this map as well. So we don't really believe we'll watch Liquid taking home more than 12 rounds or so. Betting odds are a bit more balanced in this match, but just like the previous game, we still think that Luminosity are a good step ahead, so we remain oriented in picking a Low bet on them.

We've to be slightly shorter than usual because the Final is scheduled to start in a very short time, without any real pause between matches. Dignitas as we already mentioned early today, are playing with Maziaz instead of Tenzki, not an huge change, but surely not the best for playing a Grand-Final, in particular against a team (SK) that yesterday already managed to beat them. Against Alternate, Dignitas struggled quite a lot during the first map, but still managed to win the OT, and then took advantage of their better performances on the extended map-pool for closing the game with a plain 2-0. On the other hand SK are rolling into this game after gaining access to the Final through their victory over Dignitas. As we already stated yesterday this is going a 'local' match between two teams that know each other pretty well, so the skill-gap doesn't really exist and we're expecting to watch a balanced and kinda 50/50 game. The current Betting odds are slightly skewed in favor of SK because of their yesterday victory, but at our end we wouldn't be surprised to watch RUBINO and the gang taking their revenge, so we're oriented in taking advantage of the more rewarding values by going Low on Dignitas.

This opening contest surely isn't the most exciting match out there, since neither team has played all that well over the short-term. Of the two, CSGL is at least entering this game after a decent effort against SK, the Poles managed to Tie after a close battle on Mirage. This is noteworthy considering the recent form of the Danes. While the other sub-T3 games that CSGL played ended with mixed results. And even moreso, there are still concerns regarding their performances on the extended map-pool. FlipSid3 on the other hand, have had a more difficult schedule lately, including their trip to Lithuania for the GEC Finals, however they were unable to take even a single map in their 2 games with Dignitas and CLG. But to their credit, in many of their games this year, they set up some decent things and were competitive on many of the maps, but just could not close. Which is surely an issue they've to fix in order to turn their results around. As for this contest, there are good chances we'll watch de_train, de_overpass, and de_mirage. Even across the map-pool, FSid3 should be slightly advantaged, but we wouldn't be surprised to see the Polish side manage to grab a map and force this to a third. Also, this is a double elimination playoffs so remember these entry games are more prone to random results. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor of Markeloff and friends, which is correct, Although they their results haven't been preferred recently, they've been matches above their level. Yet they still put up some decent shows, so while the percentages still rewarding for a Low Bet, FlipSid3 is our pick.

Panters (ex-London Conspiracy) managed to qualify for the Finals, but last-minute they withdrew from the tournament and have been replaced by LDLC White. The Frenchmen experienced less than satisfactory results during the APM season, but enter this event, following their recent offline appearance in Finland for Assembly Winter where they grabbed the top prize, which is surely promising. The Assembly Grand-Final with ENCE went better than most expected for the French, who beat the Finns on their home turf with a clean 2-0 sweep. Beyond that, they've been a notable challenger team, but have mostly competed below T3. But for the most part, they've shown potential to surprise some in this mid-tier playoffs. Mousesports on the other hand, began the year with several disappointing losses in highend contests. But the mixed results of the last two weeks have included several really promising wins, aligned to the top-Tier2 rank. The Germans have also improved their past pattern of struggling with lower tiered and below teams, where they commonly had issues closing out maps. As for this game, these two played each other twice in December, each taking a map. For this BO3, we believe we'll likely see de_cbble, de_dust2, and de_mirage following the Veto. Ultimately, the German-side should be favored through the map-pool, but LDLCw had success on Dust2 before so they might be able to repeat. Current Betting Odds are skewed in Favor of Mouz, which is certainly correct and expected. Although we were impressed with what the French achieved last weekend, we still feel the Germans are the more reliable pick. So Mousesports are our pick for a Low+/Avg- bet. But keep an eye on the percentages and wait closer to start time, if the percentages breach the 82/18 mark then we'd risk an ICB for LDLCw to upset.

Vexed, aside from their kinda weird short-term results, are considered an extremely deadly T2-T1 killer. Actually they are the roster that managed to achieve a high amount of upsets during the past 2 Quarters. They always step up a lot in LAN matches or against mid/high tier opponents, so we suggest not to underestimate them. On the other hand, the latest iteration of the HellRaisers roster isn't really easy to evaluate. In the past weeks they did pretty fine, but overall we're prone to considering them a good step below the previous lineup, and even if they probably sport higher firepower compared to Vexed, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them struggling a bit more than expected. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_cbble. If the veto will take this route, Dust2 should be in favor of HR, while Vexed may grab Overpass, and Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of HR, and this is correct, but honestly the current percentages are a bit too skewed, when we'll likely watch a pretty balanced game hitting all the 3 maps. So at our end we're slightly more oriented in trying our luck with a Low pick on Vexed, in order to take advantage of the better values, with hopes of watching an upset.

ALTERNATE aTTaX are one of the teams we're following closely, and so far are actually one of the revelations of this Q1 2016. The Germans managed to turn into the 2nd best team in Germany (right after Mouz), collecting a good series of promising results, even if in the short-term they slowed their run a bit and also failed to close several manageable matches. But its worth noting that they are competing on their home soil this weekend, which generally provides a good moral boost. On the other hand, E-Frag had a good start of the year but turned pretty inconsistent, and lately failing to keep the level of their gameplay on par with most of the other Tier-2 teams. Specificly the double loss against [Ancient] set off a few alarms. Even if the Swedes are surely talented and feature a really cool roster, they are still a mix, and a team such as EFrag, who've had a solid lineup for quite some time, should have managed them better. Talking about the current game, we're expecting to watch: de_dust2, de_cache and de_train. If we nailed the veto, Train may be in favor of Alternate, while Dust2 will be a pure 50/50 pick and Cache should be in favor of Efrag. Actually Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of Efrag. Honestly these values aren't really backed by the recent results achieved by the teams, while we're prone to considering this match mostly balanced. So we're oriented in picking a Low bet on ALTERNATE aTTaX in order to take advantage of the more rewarding odds.

We move back to the RGN Winter Classic, as it nears its end we have the consolidation final to determine who will face SPLYCE in the Grand-Final. Games Academy now playing under the 'Tempo Storm' banner, have proven in the early stages of the year they're a threat to be taken seriously. The Brazilians were bumped from the Upper Bracket in their last meeting with NME in semis, in a closely contested 2-1 loss. After 2 wins in the LB (inlcuding a 16-10 win over Wfx), they get a chance at a rematch in hopes of avoiding elimination. Overall, that loss to Enemy was the only relevant game they lost in the short-term, as they've defeated most of the 3rd-2nd NA Tier. As we've mentioned recently, Enemy high level form they began the year with has slowed greatly, diverting them back to the inconsistent pattern they folowed last year. Relyks and co. have surely shown vast improvements and shown alot of promise, but allowed their frustartions to take over the UB final versus SPLYCE, resulting in an awful 3rd map after failing to close the sweep 14-16 on Cobblestone. This pattern continued through their EPL matches since, going 1-1 in both their 2 game meetings with NRG and Renegades. As for this contest, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_dust2, and de_mirage. If the Veto goes this way, Dust should favor GA, while NME will be advantaged on Cache, leaving Mirage which can go either. Currently we seeing the Betting Odds rolling infavor of the Brazilian-side, but we must remember their success has been mostly short-term in addition to the fact they were defeated by Enemy in their last meeting. On our end, we find this a very tricky match to predict, particularly since the Americans have been experiencing such peaks and valleys. With that in mind, the recent inconsistency has us weary of an NME repeat performance, so we're slightly more oriented in viewing the Brazilians as the more reliable. So our pick is Low Bet on Games Academy/(Tempo Storm).

ALTERNATE aTTaX provided an extremely disappointing show versus E-Frag, surely they were the underdog, but honestly we were expecting something better than what they put up. Particularly because with scores like 8-16 and 7-16 they basically never became a real threat. As we stated many times, Alternate look interesting on paper, and have provided decent performances online as well, but maybe their limited LAN experience is causing them some troubles. Talking about LDLC White, they put up a pretty decent show versus Mousesports, and they were on the edge to force them to map-3, but unfortunately for the Frenchemen they didn't manage to take home the Overtime on Dust2. Then on Cbble they faced greater difficulties in dealing with the Germans, specificly during their CT side. However, we've to say that overall they looked a bit better than what we were hoping for, so we're prone in giving them a slight edge in this game. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_cache, de_cbble and de_dust2. In this case, Cache should be in favor of Alternate, while the French side may take Dust2, and Cobblestone may go either way. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of LDLC, and again we've some concerns about these percentages. Surely they played better than ATN yesterday, but basing the whole prediction on a single match is often gonna be a mistake, particularly since we're talking about a game that can easily hit map3. So just like the previous contest, we're again oriented in playing the odds, so our pick is a Low- one on ALTERNATE aTTaX, in order to take advantage of the more rewarding values.

YesterdayMousesports began the morning witha slow pace, and had to sweat their way towards dismissing LDLC White and avoid the 3rd map. But honestly, they're one of the big favorites of this event, so they probably didn't show all their tricks the first day, saving some cards for relevant matches, such as this one. In the short-term, the Germans have shown good things, and overall are in pretty good form, so we find them slightly more reliable than the Bulgarians. On the other hand, yesterday E-frag didn't limit their show in any way. They rolled over Alternate in easy fashion, displaying a pretty good form. Something we weren't fully expecting since the Bulgarians joined this event after a mixed bag of results, most of them kinda disappointing. Talking about this game, we'll likely watch de_dust, de_inferno and de_overpass as maps. If we nailed the veto, Mouz should have a clear edge on Dust2, while both Overpass and Inferno may go either way. Betting odds are trending in favor of Mousesports, and we're prone to agree with this as well, so our pick is a Low bet on Mouz too, with the hope to watch the Germans setting up something slightly better than against LDLC.

Surely a quite tricky match to predict, since both rosters know each other pretty well, so we're expecting a quite close game, and eventually a kinda weird set of maps due teams denying the opponent best ones instead of aiming for their favorites, as generally happens in International matches. However, Vexed are rolling into this game after a 2-0 defeat against HR, even if the plain 2-0 score may sound like an easy match, this is not the case, since both maps ended 16-14 and HellRaisers had to sweat a lot in order to dismiss the Poles. Generally Vexed is a team that step up a lot in LAN games and against T1-2 opponents, while generally they trend to overlook minor online matches, this is also the reason because their match history looks so weird. On the other hand CSGL, ended losing 2-1 against FlipSid3, a quite expected result. Even if the Polish side took home the first map they were unable to close the game, confirming one more time their issues with the BO3 format. But in this case worth noting that they totally screwed the veto, and for some unknown reason they ended banning their own best map (Mirage). Anyway, in this contest we're expecting to watch: de_overpass, de_cbble and de_train. If the veto will take this way, Vexed should have an edge on Train, while Overpass should be 50/50 and Cobblestone in favor of CSGL. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of CSGL, but honestly we can't really agree on this, since we find them extremely unreliable on the extended map-pool. Additionally we're mostly talking about a pure 50-50 game, so we're oriented in taking advantage of the more rewarding percentages by going Low on Vexed.

HellRaisers are currently quite a surprising streak. On our end, we've always considered the latest iteration of their roster to be quite inconsistent. But in the past few weeks, they've really stepped up, and rolled over a pretty good number of Tier2-3 teams, showing pretty good things (even if most of these games were pretty close). Yesterday they took home a 2-0 victory over Vexed, and we find this result valuable. (Vexed aren't an easy opponent to face) even if the map scores were quite tight. About FlipSid3, lately they've slowed their run a bit. At the GEC Finals they kinda failed to impress, even if they played decently. However this is basically a local derby, so we're expecting them to take advantage of their knowledge rather than playing with their brain switched off. Something they've done multiple times since the departure of DavCost. However, yesterday they looked fine against CSGL, so we'll likely watch a close match. Additionally skill-wise FSid3 should be a bit advantaged over HR. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_inferno, de_mirage and de_overpass. If we nailed it, we wouldn't be surprised to see HR taking Inferno, while Overpass should be in favor of FSid3, leaving Mirage which may go both ways. Current Betting odds are way too skewed in favor of HR, and this is kinda nonsense since we're mostly talking about a derby match with two teams looking well balanced. So as we already did several times today, we find the most rewarding odds the smarter option, so our pick is a Low bet on FlipSid3.

CSGL and Vexed delivered us a Polish derby treat with a pretty exciting battle to kick off the day 2 schedule, highlighted by the deciding map on Cobblestone going to OT. CSGL came out gate flying, and pretty bullied their way to the entry map advantage. But that was pretty much the pattern followed throughout this battle, CSGL edged it out to remain in the upper bracket. Although they lost their entry game vs F3, even if they made the Urkains sweat a little more than expected, and surely managed some good things. E-frag on the other hand, have kinda had a weird set matces so far. They looked really good and in strong form for their entry game with aTTaX. But then followed that with surely a sub-par performance against Mouz. Honestly,although we expected Mouz to take the match, we didn't expect the Bulgarians to make it so easy for them. So we're not really sure what happened, aside from the extended delays, but this is kinda been consistent with hot-cold pattern on LAN over the short term. As for this match, we anticipate seeing de_cache, de_dust2, and de_mirage. Provided the veto goes this route, Dust2 should favor Efrag, while Mirage should give a slight edge to CSGL, and Cache could go either way. CSGL has had a rough go at it in recent months, but have surely shown promise during this event, however E-frag is still a slight step above them. The resulting Betting Odds are trending favor of Bulgarians, which we mostly agree, but yesterday they did rise some concerns despite going down fighting at the end. Overall we still find E-Frag to be the more reliable of the two, and percentages remain rewarding for Low Bet, so we're oriented in following that path. But we wouldn't be surprised to see 3 maps, and maybe even some OT.

Again today we should some more balanced action, beginning with this contest. ALTERNATE aTTaX has been solid in the early stages of the year, but their lacking LAN experience may have contributed to shaky entry to be rudely awaken by E-frag by a quick 2-0 sweep. Honestly, both maps pretty much ended before the Germans were able to set anything up. But they certainly looked more comfortable on Day 2 in a tightly contested 2-1 victory to eliminate LDLC White. They German-side provided an outing much more aligned to recent performances. HellRaisers on the other hand have been playing exceptionally in recent weeks, and continued that trend in the entry sweep of Vexed. Although the Poles surely made them work for it, but HR stuck to their strats and took both maps. The following derby with FSid3 was a slightly different story, as they just couldn't keep up, ultimately falling in 2 maps. However, they've been quite consistent against the lower T2-T3 games and should find more success against the Germans. As far as the Veto goes, theres good chances we'll see de_cache, de_cbble, and de_overpass. Assuming we see these maps, cbble should slightly favor ATN, while Hellraisers should be advantaged on Overpass, and Cache could go either way. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of HR, which is correct. However the Germans shouldn't be underestimated, and the percentages are kinda skewing too far. On our end, we oriented in sticking with HellRaisers while its still rewarding enough for a Low Bet. But keep an eye on the percentages, and if they pass the ICB threshold (20/80), Alternate may be worth the risk.

Mousesports are rolling into this contest strong riding two solid 2-0 victories over both LDLC White and E-Frag. These matches surley confirmed their status of 'favored team' for taking the APM trophy. While the entry game was slightly more contested than what we guessed (despite the final score), the 2nd went quite smooth as the Bulgarians weren't able to offer much resistance. Overall, Mouz are looking pretty good, and we're oriented in giving them a decent edge over FSid3. Talking about the Ukrainians, FlipSid3 are on a pretty good run as well. They had to sweat a bit in order to dismiss CSGL during the opening match, but yesterday, they stepped up a lot delivering a plain 2-0 victory over HellRaisers, the winners of the last APM season (note: that was back in the days when HR had a slightly different roster). About maps, we'll likely watch: de_cbble, de_inferno and de_overpass. If the veto will take this path, Mouz should be advantaged on Overpass, while both Inferno and Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are still moving a lot, but actually they're stiill pretty skewed in favor of Mouz, which is correct since the Germans should be a slight step ahead. Anyways, we suggest to wait a bit prior making your pick, while keeping a close eye on percentages. If the values keep floating around 70/30 going Low on Mousesports is the way to go, since they are surely more reliable. But if the odds move to 80/20 you should seriously evaluate an ICB on FlipSid3, since we're talking about a game that will likely hit map-3.

And we're not referring to E-Frag, since their potential was fully known since day-1, together with Mouz they were probable candidates to reach the Grand-Final. But we're talking about ALTERNATE aTTaX who surprisingly and impressively managed to send HR packing, after a pretty tight game that featured all 3 maps extended with some thrilling Overtime. The German side had quite a rough opening match, but then got back on track and grabbed two decisive victories. This undoubtedly confirms their decent form currently, previously displayed in their online matches over the past several weeks. So at this point, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them offer a good show against the Bulgarians as well. About maps, we're expecting to watch: de_cache, de_cbble and de_train. If the veto does go this way, E-Frag should have an edge on Cache, while Cobblestone is mostly 50/50, leaving Train which may end in favor of Alternate. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on E-Frag, so we're oriented in sticking with them as they should be slightly more reliable. But overall we are anticipating a pretty close contest.

E-Frag ended up in the LB hell after losing to Mouz two days ago. But the then managed to roll through CSGL and ALTERNATE aTTaX in pretty easy fashion scoring 2-0 victories in both cases, confirming themselves as a legitimate Grand-Final contender. However, the Bulgarians are a kind of a 'hit or miss' team, if they manage to start a game well, they're prone to keeping their moral high and typically close it quickly. But if their momentum isn't rolling strong, they tend to crash pretty badly, as they did against Mousesports, in addition to plenty of other occasions as well. On the other hand, FlipSid3 have an extremely long history of beating E-Frag, and look like that is something of an art they've mastered, seeing as the Bulgarians never managed to win a single map against them. Not even in BO5s, where generally the chances of seeing a long-lasting contest are higher. Nevertheless, talking about the current event, Markeloff and friends had quite a good start. They managed to keep their run in the Upper-Bracket till yesterday, when they were swept byl to Mouz 2-0. Honestly, we were expecting to see a 3rd map, but well, as we've stated numerous times before Mousesports are the team to beat in the APM Finals, so the result was in line with the trend. Today we'll likely watch: de_overpass, de_train and de_mirage. If the veto will take this path, Train should be in clear favor of FSid3, while Overpass and Mirage could be slightly more contested and balanced. Betting odds are still pretty fair, but at our end we're oriented in picking a Low bet on FlipSid3, mostly because the Ukrainians always managed to counter EFrag pretty well, particularly if we end up watching a set of maps aligned to the one we guessed above.

Enemy are joining this game after a not so exciting short-term, where they collected a mixed bag of results and unexpectedly failed several matches that on-paper were quite manageable. Relyks and friends after a pretty exciting start of the year ended again into the NA mid-tier hell, basically a cauldron of teams that keep battling and winning/losing against each other without actually having the power to jump out of it in a clear way. On the other hand [Conquest] lately experienced a pretty huge performance drop too, and despite they were one of the 'revelations' of the NA scene, recently they flattened a lot their curve. Overall they dropped both in consistence and motivation, leaving several holes open for upsets. Talking about the current game, we're expecting to watch: de_inferno, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will go this way, both Inferno and Mirage should sport an edge in favor of Conquest, while Overpass should be slightly more balanced. Betting odds are still quite fine for going with [Conquest], so we're oriented in going Low on them, with the hope to watch them slightly more focused compared to their latest shows.
http://csgo.guru/match/3729!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8166!$Liquid!$TStorm!$TStorm!$0.6!$0.73!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another pretty interesting NA contest, however here we're not expecting to watch huge surprises. Surely the Tempo Storm (former Games Academy) roster is a team that used us at pretty interesting shows, they generally play in a way kinda aligned to the Luminosity one, and even if overall their skill-level is below their Brazilian brothers, they are usually capable to offer pretty tight battles to most of the other American teams. Liquid on the other hand, didn't play a lot in the Winter season, basically just 4 matches so far, overall achieving pretty disappointing results and dropping against both coL and LG. Without showing any real improvement, despite the addition of S1mple. However, this is a quite relevant match, so we'll likely watch them slightly more focused than before. Talking about maps, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cache, de_dust2 and de_mirage. If we nailed the veto, Cache should be in favor of Liquid, while both Dust2 and Mirage can easily go either ways. Betting odds are currently still decent for a Low pick on Liquid, so we'll stick with them. But note that the percentages are moving quite a lot, so we suggest to wait a bit prior placing your bet, and eventually go for an ICB on Tempo Storm if the values will pass the 80/20 threshold.

FlipSid3 managed to land here after beating (one more time) E-Frag, the Bulgarian side despite the start with the pedal to the metal failed to mess with Markeloff and friends on the extended map-pool, and the last two maps haven't been really contested. The Ukrainians displayed a quite decent for so far, but overall we're oriented in considering them slightly below the Mouz level, mostly because after a while their strats are get a bit predictable. On the other hand Mousesports provided a quite great show during the whole event, and moved here after scoring three 2-0s in a row, additionally they'll get also an automatic 1-0 advantage due coming from the Upper-Bracket, so they are obviously favored for taking home the trophy. Not much to say about maps, since we're talking about a BO5, however our pick is a Low+/Avg- on Mousesports because we find the Germans slightly more reliable on the extended map pool, additionally the 1-0 advantage is going to help them even further.

Last week, Fnatic managed to roll over Virtus.Pro in both of their contests, and with relative ease, while displaying quite good form. Today they'll face Gamers2, the former Titan roster, on de_cbble, a map where the Swedes have always played pretty well, so we're not really expecting to watch any huge surprises. On the other hand Gamers2 aren't doing too bad either. Surely they've improved a bit over the short-term, however Cobblestone has never been one of their favorite maps, and one they've frequently struggled even against mid-tier opponents. Fnatic should have a clear edge over this match, but the current Betting odds are already pretty skewed but still moving a lot, so even if Flusha and co. are our pick we wouldn't be surprised to see values passing our ICB threshold (set @ 82/18). If this will be the case, we suggest evaluating an ICB on Gamers2.
http://csgo.guru/match/3732!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8177!$G2!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.45!$0.19!$0.26!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for both teams, and now we're moving to de_inferno. A map where we should watch a way more balanced battle, relative to Cobblestone at least. As we already stated for the previous game, Fnatic are sporting good form right now (as they've been for months now), and they are still comfortably sitting atop their throneSo naturally, they join this game favored, and its adding that Inferno has also always been one of their best maps. Gamers2 are still the 'underdog', but overall they should be able to setup something better than during their entry game. In this case, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a tight scores and/or an OT. However, as we already implied above, we don't really feel comfortable in going against Fnatic, mostly because they are still the team to beat. So we're oriented in sticking with a Low+ pick on them, at least while Betting odds are still decent for taking this path.

Virtus.Pro are moving here following a set of really disappointing performances they accumulated during the past month. The Polish side didn't really display anything good so far, and their lack of training during most of the Winter season was surely evident in their struggles against mid-tier teams as well. Honestly, we're not expecting to see [Pasha] and co. fully bounce back today. Out of the two games they have to play today versus Dignitas, we're pretty sure we'll watch them lose at least one. However, Mirage has always been a strong map for VP, but their level has dropped over the short term. In fact we already watched them lose on it against Dignitas during DH Leipzig in late-January. About Dignitas, we have to say they played a brilliant January. But they didn't start February in the best possible way, particularly the last two defeats against SK that made them return to planet Earth pretty quickly. This is a pretty tricky game to predict, mostly because VP aren't sporting their best form currently. On the other hand, Dignitas have slowed down a bit. Meanhwile, current Betting odds are rolling in favor of Dignitas, although we think that VP should (still) have a slight edge. So our pick is a Low bet on Virtus.Pro, with the hope to watch them getting back on track.
http://csgo.guru/match/3734!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8179!$Dignitas!$VP!$Dignitas!$0.48!$0.64!$-0.16000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$One more match between Dignitas and Virtus.Pro to finish out today's ESL schedule. This time the two powerhouses will face each other on de_overpass. While Mirage generally provided more talking points because both teams have a long history on it, Overpass is going to be even way more tricky to guess. On this map Virtus.Pro have always displayed some limits, providing a pretty long set of mixed results. Basically they're not following any real pattern, but they generally play it mostly momentum-based. So considering how low is their momentum right now, we obviously have serious concerns about what they may put up here. On the other hand, Dignitas never really displayed better things either here. Even if they've stepped up a bit lately, they always had to sweat way more than expected to take home victories on Cobble. Even against low-tier opponents. Anyways, their form should be slightly above that of VP. At least today we're expecting them to join this game with a plan. Betting odds are still pretty even, and this is correct since we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 match. At our end, we're generally oriented in considering the 'new maps' (cbble/ovp) quite prone to upsets, and fields where we may watch mid-tier rosters taking home victories over Tier-1 ones, so our pick is a Low one on Dignitas.
http://csgo.guru/match/3735!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8186!$Ence!$DenDD!$Ence!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Well, not the most consistent match-up out there. Lately ENCE are kinda playing horribly. Despite the fact they're sporting a lineup that on paper, should be capable of dealing with Tier-2 rosters, currently they keep having issues in dealing with Tier-3 teams (and below). Honestly, we don't really know what ENCE's issue is, but if they don't start turning things around, we highly doubt we'll watch them stick together for more than a month or so. However, as we stated many times already,DenDD are mostly a mix, but quite a dangerous one since several of their players currently sport strong momentum. Yesterday they managed to beat Penta significantly. Additionally, the BO1 format is generally quite suitable for this kind of aim-based teams, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch DenDD do well. At our end, we still gave a little edge to ENCE (in real-world odds) because they should be better structured, but based on what they've displayed so far, we're more oriented in suggesting a Low pick on DenDD (percentages are also more rewarding).

Astralis hasn't quite managed to reach their top form. They've surely been decent in the short-term, but still quite far from what showed last fall. They come into this match with a mixed bag of results over the past few weeks, including their 3rd place finish at GEC Finals. During the 1st week of ESL S3, they split 2 maps with Gamers2, through a pretty even contest. The form of FlipSid3 on the other hand, is mostly aligned to mid-T2. Like the Danes, F3 enters this week with a mixed bag as well. However, they reached the APM S2 Grand-Final, taking down E-frag, HellRaisers, and CSGL along the way. Unfortunately, Mouz is their achilles heel, and the Ukrainians were swept to finish runner-up (but honestly, playing a Final with a stand-in and without Markeloff was an huge blow for them). But overall, a respectable upper T2 performance. But they still have troubles in dealing with Top Tier teams. Like the challenge before them today. Talking about Mirage, any map advantage is mostly negated. Both teams play on Mirage on a consistent basis and pick it with the same frequency. Currently we're seeing the odds trashed well in favor of the Danes, which is correct since they'll very likely take home this game. But at our end, with percentages floating around 85/15 we're more oriented in calling a skip due the very low reward. However, if you want to pick a side anyway you should stick with Astralis.

Astralis are obviously joining this game as the favored team. They've always played pretty well on this map, even when they lost to high ranked T1 teams, they still played decently, so despite their current not-so-amazing form they should have a clear edge over FSid3. On the other hand, the Ukrainians managed to display some promising things during APM Finals last week. They also delivered several good shows on Overpass, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a fight more consistent than expected. Just like the previous game, Betting odds here are pretty skewed in favor of Astralis, and actually barely profitable. However Overpass is generally a map slightly more prone to upsets than Mirage, so while we weren't really suggesting an ICB in the previous contest, here could be a more applicable solution, even if surely a risky pick. At our end, we're prone to taking the risk since percentages will likely move to (at least) 18/82 prior the start of the match, so we're inclined to try our luck with an ICB on FlipSid3.

Fnatic proved to be quite on point yesterday they rolled over Gamers2 pretty easily. And the week before they delivered the same service to Virtus.Pro. Despite having a rather light schedule since mid-January, the Swedes are still rocking the charts, and delivering the best performances of the scene. On the other hand EnVyUs are sitting on a pretty great winning streak as well. While Fnatic ended up winning StarSeries, the French side replied by taking home GEC Finals. Although they've mostly mesed with lower tiered opponnent over the short-term. The Frenchmen seem to be the only team capable of delivering an upset against Flusha and friends. So we're really looking forward to what they'll be able to setup today. This game is taking place on de_inferno. A big classic since both teams played it multiple times during the past few months. Overall, we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game. So even if Fnatic may sport a little edge, for sure the real-world odds are way more closer than what the Betting ones are reflecting. So on our end, we're prone toward attempting a Low pick on EnVyUs , to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages.

While the first map (de_inferno) is surely more balanced, and can easily go either way, here the edge should be more in favor of the Frenchmen. EnVyUs has always managed to deliver pretty good shows on this map. Particularly against Fnatic. (They've been consistently beating them since mid-December), so we wouldn't be surprised to watch KennyS and co. taking home a victory. However, its worth saying that Fnatic currently should be slightly better on Cache compared to what they put up during the Winter season. In the past weeks they've displayed promising things against several well-tier teams as well, so even if the French side has an edge, it shouldn't be as heavy as used to be back in the day. Betting odds are pretty balanced, so we're not going to gamble on them, instead we're attempting a Low pick on EnVyUs, since we find them a slightly above Fnatic on this map.

Possibly a more interesting contest than may look at first glance. The newest iteration of the compLexity lineup, put up an unexpected show in their premiere last week against Liquid, where they convincingly took the entry map by a significant margin. And followed that up with very close 16-14 loss. Considering their roster shuffle, we anticipated a step back from coL, but instead we saw some rather promising things throughout their first 3 map appearances, entering this match after a close loss to Tempo Storm. On the other hand, Luminosity ended 2015 at the peak of their game, surely playing the new year with higher expectations. For the most part, they've continued their top-tier level of play in the early stages of 2016, having only lost to fnatic and NaVi (in very close battles). Overall, the Brazilians remain as the top NA team, and amongst the best in all of CSGO. For the 2nd week, this series will open on Inferno, which shouldn't hold any real surprise, since LG should be advantaged throughout the map-pool. The Brazilians have plenty of experience on it, with typically decent results. Meanwhile, coL are entering this game after facing Tempo Storm (former GA squad, who play a similar playstyle to LG) on Inferno as well. We haven't seen enough Inferno coL's strength here, but they made it a close contest. Betting Odds are trending in favor of LG, and still rewarding for a Low+ Bet, so we're oriented in taking that path.

Both teams pretty much followed the same pattern over the short term, achieving a long streak of mixed results. But while SPLYCE mostly improved their performances, considering they were sitting pretty low in the rankings, OpTiC mostly slowed their run, and lately they've become quite an inconsistent roster. Despite having looked really on-point in January. However, de_cache is generally a map where OpTiC are capable of delivering good things, so they should have a decent edge here. But its surely worth saying that we wouldn't be surprised to watch SPLYCE doing a bit better, compared to their previous terrible H2Hs, seeing as they should've improved a bit in these past few weeks. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on OpTiC since we find them a bit more reliable on this map, we're oriented in taking this way,.

Now we're heading to de_cbble, a map that should be much closer compared to de_cache. On Cobblestone SPLYCE previously managed to take down OpTiC a while ago. This is also one of the maps ShahZaM and the gang never focused too much on, aside from the first weeks of the year, so we're prone toward considering their level here kinda average. On the other hand SPLYCE have played Cobble on a more consistent basis. A couple of days ago, they also managed to roll over Enemy on cbble, and they're a team who've performed quite fine over the short term as well. So overall, we wouldn't be surprised to watch Arya and co. doing fine in this game as well. Betting odds are again pretty skewed, but while the previous game was more one-sided. Here we'll likely watch a pretty tight fight, so we're oriented in trying our luck with an Low- pick on SPLYCE.

And we begin with some Group C action for Operation: Kinguin #2, featuring two teams fresh back from Krefield, Germany for the APM S2 Finals. ALTERNATE aTTaX had a decent showing at APM Finals, which included wins over LDLC White and a more impressively one over HellRaisers, in the LB semi-final. That win seemed to reflect the improvements we've seen from the Germans, since DH Leipzig where they they were defeated convincingly by HR. Overall, Alternate has shown some promising signs, by are still some ways off from consisitent hanging with the 2nd Tier. Vexed on the other hand, had a less impressive showing in Germany, where they failed to win a single matchup. They forced HR to sweat their way through consecutive 16-14 victories, where the Poles failed close. To their credit, they 'were' in that contest till the end. Much like the Polish Derby with CSGLwhich required OT on the 3rd map to determine the victor. So Vexed are putting up a fight in most of the games, but failing to close, leads to repeated losses. They've things to be encouraged by, but still have lots of work to do. As for this match, we're looking at a mostly 50/50 contest, with the slight edge favoring the german-side, mainly cause they managed the finish some of their opponents in the short-term. For this contest, we believe we'll likely see de_cbble, de_overpass, and de_train. If the Veto follows this, Vexed will be advantaged on Cobblestone, Alternate favored on Train, and Overpass could go either way. Currently, Betting Odds are still moving, but trending in favors of Germans. Based on their recent bouts, this is correct. But as we said, this is a pretty even contest, especially with the 3 map format. On our end, we've some concerns over the Polish failing to close their recent matches, but are confident enough in what they've shown to risk it and go for the Higher Reward with a Low Bet on Vexed.

As we've discussed before, ENCE is a roster packed with some potential firepower. Although the Finnish lineup has struggled to find their rhythm and chemistry to string together wins in contests they surely have talent to win. As a result, we've instead watched a series of mixed results that likely threatens the future of the team. But they are entering this match following an improved performance against DenDD that earns the Finns a spot in CEVO S9. Now they just need to start doing this with more regularity. Meanwhile the former PixelFire lineup, playing currently as Orgless while searching for a new Org, demonstrated their potential during the PGL Minor last month. February by contrast hasn't been as promising, as they've mostly lost all their matches. However they are entering this match following their best game of the month, by way of a 2-0 sweep of CPH Wolves. Though we're encouraged by this, they need to show some consistency before we gain confidence in them. Betting Odds are rolling in favor of the Finns, which correct considering their firepower and (slightly) better recent results. On our end we're inclined to agree, but this is a format prone to draws which we've good chances of seeing. Though this may be closer than expected, percentages are still rewarding enough for Low Bet on ENCE so we'll follow that path.
http://csgo.guru/match/3821!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8197!$CW!$Vexed!$null!$0.48!$0.24!$0.24!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not the most exciting match-up out there, particularly since CPH Wolves are currently playing with two stand-ins, since Gla1ve suffered by a collapsed lung while playing at Assembly Winter (GL &amp; get well soon!) and Hunden won't be able to play as well. So they're getting replaced by Tabu and Niko. This change as we already observed in the past few days, is a clear step back for the Danish team, so we don't have really high hopes for the current lineup. On the other hand Vexed aren't the most solid team when facing low-tier opponents, but honestly they should have a distinct advantage over the current iteration of CPH Wolves. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Poles taking home a 2-0 victory. Betting odds are quite skewed in favor of Vexed, and this is correct based mainly on the two stand-ins playing in CPH Wolves, so we're oriented in going Low+ on Vexed as well. In the 'worst case scenario' we should watch just a Tie.

Again we're dealing with LG and coL, whose lineup only has a handful of matches in under their belts. So once more, not the most balanced of matchups, however, the Brazilians map advantage might be slightly less significant since it's a map they never focused too much on. Although, they've still managed positive results here. We already discussed the form of Luminosity in recent weeks, beginning EPL S3 last week taking both maps over Liquid. On paper, this week's opponent should be step a below, but as a new lineup, there's not much data to reference for LG to prepare with. This may add an element of randomness that can even the field a bit. In their first couple of matches,compLexity managed to setup some encouraging things, requiring their mid-tier opponents to sweat for the win. But we've yet to see them on de_train, so we don't have anything to reference in assessing their map threat. But again, we're talking about them going up against one of the best in the game right now. And since the Betting Odds are already trashed in favor of LG, we'd certainly recommend a skip here. But you want to pick a side, our pick is Luminosity.

Penta finally figured out that the latest iteration of their roster was experiencing structural issues, and after about two months of struggling passed, they finally decided to take action. Yesterday, the Germans cut ties with Davidp, and today they'll play with zehN instead. But they'll likely try out more options during the coming weeks. However, we don't have huge hopes today. Even if they manage to take home a map, we highly doubt they'll score a plain 2-0 victory. On the other hand, FlipSid3 are doing decently. Of course yesterday they fell under the Astralis shots, but honestly, it was pretty much expected since the Danes are sitting in Tier-1. However, the FSid3's run at APM Finals was quite good, and the 3-0 loss in the Grand-Final should be ignored since they were forced to play without Markeloff, due to Passport issues. Betting odds are already quite trashed in favor of Fsid3, but despite this, we're prone to agree since in the worst case we'll likely watch just a Tie. So our pick is an Avg- bet on FlipSid3.

The Poles haven't yet bounced back from the winter break, and have lost every map they've played in Season 3. So we certainly have some concerns bout these current struggles. Meanwhile Natus Vincere hasn't quite excelled in their first couple ESL games, but they have already grabbed their first trophy of the year at DreamHack Leipzig. So the first couple maps we've seen from them aren't too alarming yet. Anyways, we're not expecting to see any real surprises here. Both teams favor Dust2, but NaVi owned VP the last time they played on it. Which is surely aligned with the current Betting Odds skewed heavily in favor of GuardiaN and friends. Considering what VP have failed to show in the short term, we're oriented in going Low on Natus Vincere. But watch the percentages, if they'll pass 80/20, VP surely has the talent to deserve an ICB.

Theres not too much to say about Natus Vincere that hasn't already been said. They've been a top-3 team for a while now, and they never failed to perform at level suitable to such ranking. Overall this is another map they've the advantage as well, so again here we wouldn't be surprised to see them continue their winning streak over the Poles. As we discussed already in the first game, Virtus.Pro are riding a discouraging losing streak since before the holidays, which we actually expected to see turn around last week, but were instead swept by Dignitas 2-0. For the amount of potential they have, we doubt it'll last much longer. Although Cobblestone is a map they never really managed to master, so these aren't the ingredients for such turn-around. Like the first game, Betting Odds are rolling in favor of the GuardiaN and friends. On our end, we feel they are advantaged for number of reasons, and be able grab the win. Percentages are still rewarding enough for a Low+ Bet on Natus Vincere, so thats our pick. Same ICB rule applies as in previous map.

The Swedes have been on hold for a pretty long time. Over the short-term they've played just a couple of matches. In both cases, performing kinda questionably. Honestly, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them follow a pattern similar to VP, since both teams didn't play at all during the Winter Season, and started the new year with pretty limited training, compared to the rest of the Tier-1 rosters. This is even more relevant when considering that Dignitas are currently experiencing a bright moment. They already rolled over VP on two maps, so we're expecting to see a pretty good show from the Danes again, even if the first map (de_train) has always been one of the favorites for NiP. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of NiP, and this is correct, but honestly the percentages are a bit too far from our real-world odds, so we're more oriented in going Low on Dignitas, since we believe that the better training may help them in delivering an upset.

However, despite the roster issues, CPHW still managed to hit a Tie yesterday against Vexed, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking home a map today as well. On the other hand, lately ENCE have been experiencing an endless amount of issues, overall providing a generally inconsistent gameplay too. For some reason the Finnish side has been relying way too much on their aim, rather than focusing on teamplay, whihch is generally one of the strongest points of most of the Finnish rosters we've observed in the past years. As we already hinted yesterday, this is a lineup who on paper, should be able to mess with Tier-2 teams. But instead they keep failing against low-tier mixes, which is pretty much nonsense, and in our opinion a coaching change could prove to be useful. Anyways, talking about the current match, as we already stated, there are good chances to see just a plain Tie. But at our end, (despite the latest disappointing shows) we're oriented in going Low on ENCE, since we don't feel confident picking CPHW due to the stand-ins.

While NiP were slightly favored on Train, here things are going to be quite different. The Swedes always faced more issues on Mirage compared to most of the other top-tier teams. Aside from a short good stint right after summer, they never really managed to deal with this map in solid way or with a consistent pattern. So overall we're expecting a pretty close game, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Swedes having serious issues, particularly during the T side. On the other hand, Dignitas managed to put together a good set of strats for this map lately, and their 16-5 victory over VP clearly highlighted this. Additionally, as we stated in the previous match as well, the Danes have played way more in the short-term compared to NiP, so while F0rest and friends may need some rounds to figure out things and adjust to the new Dig playstyle, Dignitas can just push the pedal to the floor and focus on taking home a victory. Here betting odds are trending in favor of RUBINO and co., and honestly we're prone to agree, so our pick is a Low bet on Dignitas.

During that match FlipSid3 managed to take home a 2-1 victory after a pretty contested match-up, so today we're expecting to enjoy a similar battle, and much likely a Tie since we're talking about a BO2. FlipSid3 are heading into this game already well warmed-up thanks to their entry game against Penta, and as we already stated plenty of times Markeloff and co. are experiencing a quite good moment. For sure hitting the APM Grand-Final delivered them some extra motivation, so we'll likely watch them doing slightly better in the next weeks. About E-Frag, they started the year pretty well, but lately they slowed down a bit and even at APM Finals we were expecting something slightly better from them. However they are a roster fully capable to win at least a map out of the two they're playing today, so as we wrote above, we don't believe we'll watch anything different from a draw. Betting odds are still pretty decent for going Low+ on FlipSid3 so we're oriented in taking this path, since we find them slightly more reliable.
http://csgo.guru/match/3840!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8220!$Renegades!$CLG!$Renegades!$0.42!$0.43!$-0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Now we move into the NA portion of todays EPL matches, and our first batch features a NA/AU showdown. Renegades haven't too busy during the early stages of the year, having only participated in IEM Taipei. There, they likely should've been the favorite but finished runner up to TheMongolz, who convincingly swept the Aussies in the Grand-Final. In last weeks EPL entry games, they managed a decent effort, beating Enemy on Train, but failed to repeat at mirage. Considering the above average form of NME this year, (although more inconsistent lately) a 1-1 is an acceptable result. CLG on the other hand, is kind of riddle. They played surprisingly well at GEC Finals. But moving online, they lost their first 4 EPL games (split between Cloud9 and Tempo Storm), two of which were lopsided losses. Near end of last Summer, they were a solid Top-T2 team, but their recent performances are more aligned to Tier3. So we have concerns over whether they can regain the prior form. For this first game, de_dust2 will be featured, which surely favors the Americans. Especially since its not one of the Australians top map picks. The last occasion these two played on it, the Aussies managed to beat CLG, but that was last quarter. Its also worth noting, Renegades has only played a couple matches since replacing Havoc with USTILO. Betting Odds are fairly even still, favoring CLG slightly. We pretty much in full agreement, so we're oriented in following the same path since we feel they have a higher ceiling. So our pick is a Low Bet on CLG.

A map where both teams have accumulated a mixed bag of results. So neither one has quite managed to play it with any consistency. On that note, as we already implied, inconsistency is the challenege CLG is currently faced with. Since returning to online competition, the North Americans managed to get to form. And these are matchups they have good chances to take home. Meanwhile, Renegades haven't played enough just yet to gain any traction with the latest roster iteration. And this is a map they should have better chances to grab. For the most part, the few times they played it, they've setup some good things. However, the matchup might be a little momentum based, where we might see some carry-over from Dust2. Betting Odds in this case, are most even, while our Real-World award the slight edge to the NA-side. On our end, we still see CLG as the more reliable pick, particualrly since the previous visit to Inferno by the Aussies was 16-2 flop in a below-T3 contest.

As you may guess, this isn't an easy match to predict, since both teams over the short-term have delivered a good number of mixed performances. Even if NME has generally performed slightly better, the new coL roster managed to take home some rather interesting results, such as the victory over Liquid and a close game against Tempo Storm. Its also worth noting that CompLexity never really focused on de_train in the short term, so even if they're sporting decent form, we don't believe they have an edge here. Particularly since Enemy has delivered acceptable results on this map in the last few weeks. Betting odds are still quite even, and this is going to be a quite risky game either way. But on our end, we're prone towards attempting a Low pick on Enemy, since we find them slightly more reliable.

For this game we're moving to de_cache, which is surely going to be a way more interesting show compared to Train, since both teams have looked extremely on-point on this map. Cache has always been one of the signature maps ofEnemy,which they've played plenty of time. Here they've always delivered consistent results, so they should move here with a solid plan. On the other hand CompLexity made their debut with the new roster on this map, and they immediately managed to roll over Liquid in a pretty impressive fashion. Obviously a single good match isn't really relevant from a statistic stand-point, so we don't suggest giving too much value to this result alone, even if it's surely promising. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of coL, mostly because the victory over Liquid we mentioned above, while Real-World odds are surely way more balanced. So on our end, we're oriented in playing with the percentages and going with a Low pick on Enemy because of the higher reward.

For this BO% Grand-Final, SPLYCE will carry a 1 map advantage, do to coming from the Upper-Bracket. Honestly, according to the way the Brazilians are playing right now, that 1 map could make all the difference. The Americans are entering this match following a very poor performance against OpTic last night. Through the 2 maps, SPLYCE only took 10 rounds, and at no point ever looked to be a any threat. A week prior to that, in the UB Final, they put worth a strong effort in their 2-1 victory over Enemy that gave them today's advantage. But the encouraging things they offered there are surely overshadowed by the lackluster effort they put up last night. Tempo Storm on the other hand, were Games Academy when this event started. And in the past few weeks, the Brazilians have continued to impress one game after the next. They were bumped from the UB by NME during the Semis, in what pretty much their only loss in the past few months. The Brazilians went on to eliminate WinterFox and then got their rematch with NME in LB Finals, taking their revenge in a 2-1 win, on their path here. Overall, Tempo is currently one of the teams to beat in the NA. And based on the form they've achieved in the short term, they have a great chance of taking this. As for the maps, theres good chances we'll see de_cache, de_dust2, de_train, and de_mirage. Train could pretty much go either way, while the Brazilians should have the advantage on the rest. Based on this, we're mostly seeing the Betting Odds trashed in favor of Tempo Storm. As we've repeatedly said, they've been on terror, beating many of the mid-low teams. Despite the map advantage to Splyce, we honestly doubt they win more than another map in this contest, so we're oriented towards evaluating a skip. But if really want to go with a side, Tempo Storm is our Pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/3847!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8225!$E-Frag!$FSid3!$FSid3!$0.48!$0.48!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We begin another busy day with the second Upper Bracket Semi-Final of the UCC Europe, featuring a matchup we've watched quite a couple of times in the past week. During the APM Finals, we observed E-Frag fall in the Consolidation Final in a lackluster effort ending 2-1. The two met again yesterday in CounterPit, but this time, the Bulgarians came within an OT on Cbble of sweeping F3, but instead had to settle the 1-1 Tie. Of course we're comparing LAN to Online in this case, but overall it was certainly a significantly closer contest than last meeting. After FlipSid3 beat E-frag at APM, they went on to lose to Mouz in the Grand-Final, in a game they never really threatened. Since then, the momentum they had on LAN seems it may have passed, having lost the following 5 maps prior to the OT mentioned above. But in the previous weeks FSid3 have surely showed overall improvements, so we'll likely watch another balanced Bo3. As far as the Veto goes, theres high probability we'll see them pick de_overpass, de_inferno, and de_cbble. Assuming these are the maps, E-Frag will have an edge on Inferno, while Markeloff and friends should be advantaged on Overpass and Cobblestone. Based mostly on strong showing the Bulgarians put up yesterday, the Betting Odds are trending in their favor. But they're moving still, so we suggest waiting to closer to start time. On our end, we feel Ukrainians won't be repeating the limited effort put up yesterday. So we'll go for the higher reward with a Low pick on FlipSid3.

As we stated recently as well, Penta has cut ties with Davidp and temporary replaced him with zehN. This change has surely shaken up the roster, that in the short-term replied with a surprising 2-0 victory over FlipSid3 and PANTERS, surely an encouraging wake-up sign from the Germans. On the other hand CSGL are still sitting in the Limbo they've hung for the last few months. The Poles never really managed to step-up, and they've mostly collected a pretty good amount of mixed and non-sense results. Honestly they're one of the most inconsistent teams out there, and they aren't really displaying any real sign of improvement. So while in this game they can surely take a map and Tie the whole thing. We don't however really believe they'll manage to win them both. Even if we don't really enjoy the way CSGL is playing, our pick is a Low bet on them since we find that the veto may give them a little advantage (we'll likely watch Mirage &amp; Cache), with the hope of watching them play as they did yesterday.

On de_inferno FaZe always played on a pretty decent way, and always been one of the few maps where the EU-mix managed to achieve decent results, despite their kinda low consistency. Generally the former G2 roster always had serious issues in dealing with the extended map-pool, but now with the Bo1 format they should capable to take home both their games, in particular according to the 2-0 they scored against Virtus.Pro last week. On the other hand, FlipSid3 after a good stint at APM Finals had a kinda rough week, and aside from the expected loss against Astralis, they somehow ended losing against Penta as well, and managed to hit a last-minute Tie against E-Frag shortly after. So we're oriented in considering them a step below FaZe. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of FaZe and we kinda agree on this. However, the percentages aren't really profitable, so you should seriously consider a plain skip. But if you want to pick a side, the way to go is FaZe.

We already discussed about the form of FlipSid3 in their previous 2 games, so we'll just add that on Cobblestone Markeloff and friends frequently managed to deliver quite good shows, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a proper fight. On the other hand FaZe basically never really played this map before, and they always favored Overpass over it, so guessing how they'll play is basically impossible, even if on paper they should sport an higher firepower compared to FSid3. Betting odds are still skewed in favor of FaZe, despite the lack of reliable data, and this is surely a bit weird. As we stated above we wouldn't be surprised to watch a game way closer than expected, so we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB/Low- pick on FlipSid3, mostly because their higher experience on Cobble.

The Polish giants still have to win a single EPL match, and out of the 8 they played in the past weeks they collected just embarrassing defeats, so obviously we've serious concerns about their current form and we fear that their EPL run is already quite compromised. According to what we watched so far, we doubt that things will turn better today, since Mousesports are a quite solid opponent, and the Germans are also landing here after winning the APM Grand-Final,additionally we're talking about a roster that played a pretty good Q1 2016, something we cannot say about VP. This first game is taking place on de_mirage, a map the Poles historically always played well, but where lately they failed to put up decent shows, so even if we might watch a close game we wouldn't be surprised to watch a fail such as the one the Poles experienced against Dignitas, in particular since Mouz are currently sharing a pretty similar pattern with the Danes, and both teams can be considered almost equal. Betting odds are trending in favor of Mouz, and this isn't surprising according to the VP losing streak, but honestly if there is a map where the Polish side can make a comeback, this map is Mirage. So even if we'll probably regret this pick, we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Virtus.Pro, in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

While things could be tricky on de_mirage due VP being still an huge question mark, stuff should be slightly more streamlined on Inferno. Surely Mousesports aren't famous for enjoying this map too much and in the short-term they ended vetoing it most of the times, but Virtus.Pro are on the same boat, and even during their peak moment they never really managed to play it on-par with the rest of T1 rosters. So here we're mostly talking about a game that is favoring the team sporting the strongest momentum, then Mousesports should have a slightly edge over VP. Betting odds are currently quite skewed in favor of the German side, and even if this is correct, the real-world odds are surely slightly more balanced. However, at our end we're trending in favor of Mousesports since we're mostly talking about a neutral map, but we don't really suggest to go with values above Low.

Here we're featuring two teams we often looked forward to watching face off. Although, neither team has quite got back to their form from last Quarter. Cloud9 is surely the closer of two to regaining the that level of consistency. But a series of decent games, they'll enter todays contest fresh off a disappointing defeat to Tempo Storm. But as we've said numerously, the Brazilians dominating much if the NA. But for this first game, we're on de_dust2, which is a stronger map for C9 where they've mostly played well. Meanwhile, Liquid is off to a very rough 1st Quarter. Again, the lack practice and matches, has badly impacted their performance, having lost the majority of their games this year. A few days ago, they also fell to Tempo Storm in the Katowice Qualifier. But honestly, they made it a much closer match than we were expecting based on their recent struggles. Additionally this will be also their first game with Koosta instead of AdreN, so will be interesting to watch how the former Enemy star will perform in an high-end environment. Unlike Cloud9, Dust2 is not a map Liquid has done well on. They're already entering this match a disadvantage, and combined with the map pick, we're really not expecting Skadoodle and friends to have too much iseue taking this map. So they're our pick for Low Bet.

Compared to Dust2, this map should make for a more evenly balanced contest. Out of the many occasions these two have battled, this is the first we'll see Train host it. We already covered the horrid start to the year from Liquid. We expected some possible hiccup of progress following a lineup change. But now as speculation floats about their alleged intent to sign koosta (despite whatever the outcome may be), our concern for whether they can get back on track soon, is even greater. Since this may suggest continued internal issues and pressure from org to improve, which can surely a negative impact on their performances. This match may not provide the confidence they so badly need right now. Cloud9 on the other, had a shaky start as well, but over the short term has surely improved their game, and again we're starting to see some of the effective strats that found them so much success last much. They never focused too much on Train either, but still they've actually had decent results on it. (Although not-so-good in short term). So we basically find both teams mostly aligned on Train, and can see this map going either way. But still, C9 is surely the more reliable team right now. So even though we find it difficult to see Liquid continue losing consecutive games, and with respect the form of C9 recently, we're more confident in Cloud9 be able to close this one as well. So they're our pick again. But this is certainly a risky map, so be sure to keep to values, especially because Liquid is due for a win,

Not the most exciting match out there, but actually a fairly even Lower Tier matchup, so at least we'll hopefully enjoy a good show. SPLYCE looked promising in their first couple of games following the NA shuffle, particularly at the MLG Columbus Qualifier. There they eliminated the hyped OpTic squad en route to a Grand-Final loss vs Enemy. But since that event, they've achieved mixed results, with many of the mid-tier games ending in defeat. Last night they entered the Winter Classic II Grand-Final with a 1 map advantage in their bo5 against Tempo Storm, but only managed to win 1 of the 4 maps and ended losing 3-2. Also following the Shuffle, the ex-SKDC roster moved to AGG. But the org change hasn't really affect the results too. The Canadian/US mix have also had mixed bag of results. Its worth noting in the majority of the games, including the losses, they have at least been competitive. Obviously there's still work to be done, but in the short term they've been a relatively solid group with the potential to ascend the 3rd Tier. In their last meeting two weeks ago, these two settled for a Tie. But this game will require winner, (since CEVO has upgraded to BO3s). As for today's match, we believe there's good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_mirage, and de_inferno. If the Veto follows this path, Cache will favor SPLYCE, Mirage will favor AGG, and Inferno could either way. So we're pretty much talking about a pure 50/50 matchup. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of SPLYCE, which considering the more experienced roster and the slightly higher firepower, is correct. Additionally, despite the losing to Tempo, they did put up somewhat of a decent fight. Which is only noteworthy since the Brazilians are simply playing at another level right now. On our end, we're inclined to agree. However, we wouldn't be surprised to see AGG make this a much tighter contest. So we're oriented more towards trying our luck for the high reward, and going for a Low- pick on AGG.

The entry game has been community voted to be EnVyUs vs Fnatic, so we're kicking-off with a pretty exciting matchup, featuring two of the most solid teams of this first Quarter of the year. Due to the very peculiar format used in this event, (basically a 'King of the Hill'), predicting the games taking place during the first couple of days is going to be pretty hard. Additionally, the BO1 matches aren't going to help much either, especially in top-tier games, like the one we're reviewing now. As usual, guessing the map in BO1s is basically impossible. So we've to evaluate the teams based on the bigger picture. In this case, Fnatic look to be the slightly more reliable pick. Considering EnVyUs frequently starts their event entry matches kinda 'slowly', and generally their LAN performances have always been a tiny bit below the established level of the Swedes. Obviously the map will play an huge role, but on our end we're prone toward picking a Low bet on Fnatic, since we find them as slightly more solid on the extended map-pool.
http://csgo.guru/match/3862!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8258!$Astralis!$G2!$Astralis!$0.55!$0.68!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$As mentioned early today, predictions related to ESL Barcelona must be slightly shorter than usual due the very short time available between matches and because the peculiar format used for this event. However, the 2nd match is going to be Astralis vs Gamers2 and we're going to watch just another pretty contested game since both teams already faced each other just a week ago in EPL, and they finished 1-1. Additionally we'll watch a game heavily influenced by the map that will be picked, and since we're talking about a BO1, the chances to guess it are pretty low. However we wouldn't be surprised to watch de_dust2 or de_train. In the first case Astralis should have an edge, while in the second we'll likely enjoy a pretty balanced fight. Betting odds are still quite decent for going Low on Astralis, so we're oriented in taking this path since we find them slightly more reliable than G2.

Talking about the current match, FlipSid3 are moving here after a week where they collected a mixed bag of results, playing slightly below the level they displayed at APM Finals last weekend, however they still managed to take down E-Frag with a clean 2-0 sweep, so we're expecting them to perform decently in this game as well. On the other hand, PixelFire, now known as Orgless, in the short-term followed a similar pattern, and only during the past week they woke up a bit, managing to take home a couple of relevant victories over Ancient and CPH Wolves, together with a Tie against ENCE. Surely promising, but honestly FlipSid3 on the extended map-pool should be still a step ahead. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_mirage, de_cbble and de_train. If the veto will go this way, Cobblestone should be in favor of FSid3, while both Mirage and Train can go either ways. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, so we're prone in avoiding the Orgless roulette, and we'll pick a Low bet on FlipSid3 instead, since we find Markeloff and friends slightly more reliable.

We're moving into a pretty interesting contest. Dignitas barely survived against gBots, and even if they somehow managed to deliver a nice comeback in the end, we cannot really say that the Danish side was playing well. However, the opening games are always tricky, so they'll likely improve as they progress ahead. On the other hand, this is entry game for Vexed, and as we stated plenty of times already they are a team that generally step-up a lot in games featuring the BO1 format and good opponents, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Poles setting up a show above their latest kinda disappointing online performances. Betting odds are trending in favor of Dignitas, and this is correct, but in our opinion there is room for a Low-/ICB pick on Vexed as well, mostly because the Polish side used us to nice surprises, so at our end we're oriented in gambling on them

As we already stated this morning both teams are basically equal and during the first Quarter of the year they followed a pretty similar pattern. In the entry game, EnVyUs managed to take home a victory, and after a pretty balanced first half, the Frenchmen somehow delivered an incredible T side, something not really usual on de_train. However, here we'll likely watch de_cbble as map, and things will surely be more balanced, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch OTs as well. Betting odds are still even too, and overall we're messy with a pretty risky contest, but at our end we believe that the Swedes will manage to take their revenge, so our pick is a Low bet on Fnatic.

X6tence are heading here after two stunning defeats at the hands of Vexed and Astralis, so this is going to be their last 'life'. Honestly, there are very little chance of watching them take down Gamers2. The Frenchmen have only played a single game so far, but an extremely tight contest with [Astralis] that required an OT. Despite the loss, they looked to be in decent form, and overall they've always played better in BO1s than in BO3s, so we're not too surprised. However, we don't really think we'll watch any miracles occur here, plus betting odds are quite horrible too (== not rewarding). So you can just go for a plain skip and look forward to the following matchup. If you want to pick a side anyway, just stick with Gamers2, but this is kinda obvious.

Also a rematch of the UB Final. However, for this match and a BO3, PixelFire will enter this contest with 1 map advantage. Which is kinda silly when we're only talking about a BO3. Again, we're moving from on e match directly to the next, so we must stay brief. Honestly, we were a bit surprised the Eu bunch was able to defeat F3 in their earlier match. There they proved a bit more their potential. So the map advantage will force the Ukraines to require a sweep on order to achieve. Considering the recent mixed results they've shown since APM, we're not all too comfortable in betting on them to hold PF winless in this finale. Betting Odds are trending in favor of Orgless (PixelFire), which for this match is appropriate. they've already shown they can beat F3, but the extra map is kinda the icing on the cake. So with percentages still rewarding enough for Low Bet, we feel they're the safer pick at the moment, so we're oriented in following that path.

Now we'll move forward with another excellent match, and possibly the best matchup of the day so far. For this battle, the Swedes picked Astralis to face off with EnvyUs, in hopes of destructing the French and Danish alliances. Astralis had to sweat their way through their entry game victory over Gamers2 that required OT. Followed that up with a dominating win over X6tence. So overall, the Danish-side surely looks to be in stong form, and should be poised to fully test NV. Meanwhile EnvyUs was setup with Fnatic to begin this weekend, and the French were able to gain the first win. But a rematch shortly followed, where the Swedes managed to even up the head2head here in Barcelona. But now the Frenchmen will enter this contest warmed up from their earlier win over gBots, which should be to their advantage, since Astralis has yet to play today. Currently, the Betting Odds are overly skewed in favor of the French-side, but we need to remember this is nearly a 50/50 contest, with a edge only slightly in favor of NV. So, although we feel NV should be take home the map, we believe the Danes certainly have the potential overcome the challenge, especially since the two have have gone back n forth in previous matches. So on our end, we're moreso oriented towards trying our Luck for the higher reward, and going for Low Bet on Astralis with hopes they can pull it off.
http://csgo.guru/match/3900!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8283!$Dignitas!$Vexed!$Dignitas!$0.55!$0.86!$-0.30999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Day 2 continues forward, as we move into the 14th match of Esl Barcelona. We just saw Astralis defeat NV, and keeping with the Danish alliance, they elected fellow countrymen Dignitas to square off with Vexed, in hopes of keeping the Danish teams in the best position for success in this tournament. As saw just two matches ago, the LAN success we've seen from Dignitas over the last several weeks is still going strong, but they were unable to close out the game against Fnatic, who forced the Danes into OT. But the relevancy here, is the competitive form RUBINO and friends are currently displaying. And now, thanks to the Astralis victory, they've been given the best chance for a win, having to face the Poles for their next battle. Vexed on the other hand, as we've discussed have been quite a mixed bag in recent weeks. In their entry game of this event, already faced the Danes for a disappointing show, in a contest the Polish-side never really threatened. Following a quick win over x6, they fell for the second time vs Gamers2. So they're now facing elimination for the first time this weekend. Current Betting Odds are already trashed in favor of the Danish. And based off what they've achieved on LAN in recent events, we're in agreement with strong chances here. Although, 85/15 to overly favored. Regardless, we are also confident with what they've done, so with these percentages we're oriented towards skipping this match, since we doubt Vexed can manage to stop the momentum of the Danes. But if you must pick a side, Dignitas is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/3901!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8284!$G2!$Astralis!$G2!$0.45!$0.34!$0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another pretty high-end game here in Barcelona, and here we're surely reviewing a pretty interesting matchup. Both teams had a pretty good run in this event, and Gamers2 failed only a single game so far, in Overtime, so we've good feelings about them, and without doubts they stepped forward compared to their latest online results. But as we already wrote, G2 are a team that always did fine in BO1s, so they are playing as we were expecting. On the other hand Astralis are running hot too, and they still have to lose a single 'life'. Overall the Danes are looking a bit better than the rest of the T1 teams taking part at the event, and their latest victory over Envy clearly displayed that. Betting odds are still pretty decent, so we're oriented in taking a 'safe' path by going Low on Astralis, even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Frenchmen setting up an hell of a fight.

This is the third time that these rosters are facing each other during this event, so this is kinda of a derby. The first two games went one per side, so will be interesting to watch where this one will lead. As we already stated multiple times, both EnVyUs and Fnatic played incredibly well during the first part of the year, and basically they joined ESL Barcelona quite aligned in performances. As we wrote for the previous games as well, this is going to be a pretty hard match to predict, since both teams are generally really good on the extended map-pool, so will be more matter of focus and aim. Betting odds are quite aligned too, but at our end we're prone in going with a Low pick in favor of Fnatic, since we find them a slightly bit more reliable than the Frenchmen.

The two managed to avoid each other the first days, both surviving long enough to finally have too meet. Astralis to this point have been one of the most consistent teams this weekend, highlighted in their victories over Gamers2 and EnvyUs, particularly the marginal win over NV. But they lost their first 'life' yesterday in the rematch with G2, which was surprising on Dust2. But they simply got too deep in the whole in the 1st half, making their 10 round rally not enough. But overall, they've been playing solid and in form for what might be a quite tricky local game. Dignitas has also been representing the country well, and continue to impress on LAN. They're coming into the day following their second victory and elimination of Vexed. More notably, Dignitas looked to be firing on all cylinders in their lone loss to fnatic, that needed OT to determine the winning side. However, one point of note is the Danes had the lead late against the Swedes, but failed to close em out, a problem we saw often last quarter during high level matches. So we're interested to see how they respond if they push their local countrymen deep into the late rounds. But overall, its fair to say Dignitas has surely stepped up a level this year, and seem to improve a little more with test. So there is surely the possibility to watch this go in their favor. Betting Odds are obviously rolling in favor Astralis, but this is definitely a tricky and risky contest to call. RUBINO and company always had issues in handling Astralis, but we haven't seen this matchup since Dig has raised their game. On our end, we have difficulty going against the reliability of Astralis, so they're our pick as long as the percentages remaining rewarding. But of course if we see them push 85/15, then ICB gamble on the guys who have continued to surprise.

Of course now we're talking about a LAN contest, and theres no question over the weekend Gamers2 has provided a better show than expected. Managing to win all their games aside the opening match against Astralis that ended in Overtime in the Danes's favor. However, the French side properly managed to take their revenge yesterday, dismissing the Danish side 16-13 on de_dust2. Without a doubt Fnatic are hitting this game as favored, backed by their two EPL victories, together with a solid streak here in Barcelona. But overall, we wouldn't be surprised to watch Gamers2 playing exceptionally better than we they provided online. Particularly if we watch Dust2 as map again. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of Fnatic, and even if the Swedes are advantaged, the real-world percentages are much closer. So on our end, we're prone toward attempting an ICB on gamers2, surely a risky pick but potentially a profitable one.

And honestly not much to add to what we already wrote, the Danish derby is always quite interesting to watch, but according to what we watched so far Astralis are still a step ahead and should be so in the current match as well, where we'll see de_overpass as map. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Device and friends, and this is quite obvious, even if real-world percentages are surely closer than these odds. However, at our end we're oriented in going Low+ on Astralis, but feel free to attempt an ICB on Dignitas if the values will move to 15/85 or so.

So here we'll just add that out of the two games they'll play against each other, we wouldn't be surprised to watch Gamers2 taking one, according to the way they're playing during ESL Barcelona. Surely Fnatic are hitting this game as favored, and they have a better knowledge of the extended map pool, but still on several maps such as Dust2 and Cache scores might be way closer than expected. Betting odds are again extremely skewed in favor of the Swedes, and while this is correct, the current percentages edging the 20/80 are kinda off and not really amazing for going with the favorite team. So we're oriented in giving a spin at the Gamers2 roulette with an ICB on them.

Fnatic are one more time looking like the team to beat, and aside a loss versus EnVyUs, they did pretty fine and aligned to their usual very high standards. On the other hand, Astralis delivered an almost seamless performance too, but they surprisingly failed to deal with Gamers2, losing their 1st 'life'. However not really relevant, since the Danes immediately moved back on the right track and steamrolled Dignitas twice. This is basically a pure 50/50 game, and the current betting odds are kinda non sense, since both teams performed in a kinda similar way. So at our end we're oriented in taking advantage of the more rewarding percentages by going Low on Astralis.

Now we messing with strictly top tier matchups, and move in to the second game in a row for Astralis and Fnatic. The Danish side have looked quite decent this weekend, having only lost to Gamers2 yesterday in a tightly fought affair. Today we watched them face their local countrymen in back to back matchups, where Astralis basically had the upper hand for the entirety of both contests, ultimately eliminating Dignitas from the tournament. Considering the recent form of RUBINO and friends, these consecutives wins were quite a feat. Now the Danes will face the Fnatic for the second match in row as we approach the end of the event. Theres no doubt of the Danes potential and form this weekend, and though they're going to be the underdog, they c ertainly have the possibility of upsetting the number one team in the scene. Fnatic on the other, as with most of their tournaments, has steadily improved as the weekend progressed. Prior to the double header with the Danes, the Swedish side have only lost their entry game to EnVyUs. This morning they had to deal with G2, who've also had an exceptional weekend, where Olofmeister and the gang impressively defeated them in back to back maps. The fact they won wasn't too surprising, but they margins of their victories were quite stunning 16-8 and 16-7, respectively. The momentum they've gained through the day surely have them on the precipice of another trophy. Betting odds are expectedly rolling in favor of Swedes, which is correct based on the above mentioned performances. However, Astralis cannot and should not be overlooked, particularly in back to back contests. So on our end, we're more oriented in taking the risk on the greater reward, and pursuing an ICB on Device and co.

In this Quarter-Final we've another very interesting matchup. CLG hasn't got back their form from prior to holidays, and coming into the weekend, are fresh off losses to Renegades and Tempo Storm. However they looked quite confident in their entry game vs JMIF. Overall, they're backed with more experience, particularly in higher stakes competitions, so they'll carry that edge into this contets. AGG on the other hand, have been quietly creeping their way up the NA 3rd Tier ranks in the short term. And they've surely proved themselves solid enough to give anyone a full test. They put together a several really strong performances, earning them victories over Enemy(/Selfless) and SPLYCE. But now they're facing, arguably one of the stronger threats in the NA scene. On our end we feel AGG has shown tremendous promise in recent weeks, and certainly feel they may be catching CLG at a more fragile time, and should be win a map, and maybe steal a second. So we're oriented in risking the percentages, and going for a more rewarding Low Bet on AGG.

Liquid this evening are fielding the latest iteration of their roster, featuring Koosta instead of AdreN, and according to what they displayed so far the change is going quite well, and in their game against Renegades they clearly showed promising things. On the other hand CLG are moving here after a pretty disappointing month, but at least this evening they had a pretty good run, even if so far they didn't face any really challenging opponent yet. So this game will be their first real test. About maps, we're expecting to watch: de_train, de_overpass and de_cbble. If the veto will go this way, Train may end in favor of CLG, while Cobblestone will likely go to Liquid and Overpass is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Hiko &amp; co., and at our end we're prone to agree on this, so we'll go Low+ on Liquid too, even if we'll likely watch a close game.

Both teams are landing here after a couple of pretty convincingly matches, and in particular the last ones were pretty tough for both sides. Cloud9 had to sweat a lot in order to dismiss NRG, and they managed to roll over them just in the last few rounds of map3. Honestly C9, despite the pretty decent streak, are currently looking a bit shaky, and we've some doubts about what they'll put up against a well structured team such as Tempo Storm. On the other hand, the Brazilians had to deal with OpTiC, in what turned into another really tight match, even if the last map has been closed in a pretty easy fashion by Tempo. However, talking about the current match, we're expecting to watch: de_dust2, de_cache and de_mirage. If we nailed the Veto, Mirage should be in favor of Tempo, while both Cache and Dust2 can easily go either ways. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on Tempo Storm, so we're oriented in taking this path, since we find them more reliable thanks to the stronger momentum.

Penta a week ago enforced a light roster-change by switching Davidp with Zehn, even if we're not talking about an extremely relevant transfer, it surely helped in waking up the rest of the lineup. At least seems so, since the German side finally managed to achieve a victory (over FlipSid3) after a pretty long streak of disappointing shows. However, today the Germans are facing SK, and honestly we don't have huge hopes. The Danes, are currently running pretty hot, and in the current Quarter made an huge step ahead, in particular worth noting that they are landing here after victories over Natus Vincere and Dignitas, so we're expecting to watch them continuing their positive series today as well. Betting odds are trending in favor of Friis &amp; friends, and this is quite correct since we're talking about a BO2 and we highly doubt we'll watch SK losing two maps in a row, so our pick is a Low+/Avg- bet on them

Surely E-frag are doing decently, but lately they dropped a bit in performance compared to how they were playing during the entry part of the year. They still sport a quite high fire-power, but their executions turned a bit messy, and in the past weeks we watched the Bulgarians throwing away games that just few weeks before they were able to close. So, since we're talking about a BO3 we wouldn't be surprised to watch them being dragged into map3. On the other hand, the former PixelFire lineup, now known as Orgless turned into a serious T3 contender, and they are moving here strong of several noticeable performances, such as the 2-0 sweep they delivered to Ancient and the close victory over FlipSid3, so we're talking about an underdog that this evening should be able to setup a quite hard fight too. Betting odds are skewed in favor of E-Frag mostly because their wider experience, but at our end we're oriented in keeping the real-world odds aligned to the middle, and we're prone in taking advantage of the more rewarding percentages by going Low on ex-PixelFire.

Overall we're talking about a pretty balanced game, ENCE despite the promising roster and the quite good fire-power, is still floating pretty low in the chart, struggling against low-tier opponents and without a clear focus on strats yet. Overall we don't have huge hopes, and we doubt we'll watch them taking more than a map out of the two we'll watch today. On the other hand, Vexed are looking a tiny bit better on the extended map-pool, and in the short-term they also displayed better things compared to the Finns, so we're oriented in considering them a 'lil more reliable. So, even if there are good chances to watch just a Tie, our pick is a Low one on Vexed.

While the first game against ex-PixelFire could be tricky for the Bulgarians, this one should go in a slightly smoother way, since ex-LC in the short-term delivered a quite long streak of kinda disappointing results. Additionally we're now talking about a BO2, so E-Frag in the worst case should be capable to take home at least a map and Tie the game. However, worth noting that the Norwegians aren't newcomers, and even if currently they are flawed by some heavy inconsistency, they are surely sporting enough skill to grab a map, in particular if E-frag will jump in this game without the right mindset. Anyway, since we're talking about a BO2 we're oriented in taking a conservative way, so our pick is a Low+ bet on E-Frag, since we find them slightly more reliable than the PANTERS roulette.
http://csgo.guru/match/3925!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8321!$WinterFox!$NRG!$NRG!$0.52!$0.32!$0.2!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$The only 'ranked' North American match we'll enjoy this evening, and on paper, a pretty even one. NRG as we've written several times already, are one of the few 'lineups to watch' in the NA scene. What they've displayed in the short-term has been extremely promising. We've always been fans of hybrid NA/EU rosters, because we find this kind of 'contamination' pretty enjoyable at the gameplay level (also quite cool to watch). However, NRG are moving here strong of a couple of victories over Splyce, and a close loss against Cloud9. Even if they keep improving game after game, they still have a long journey ahead in order to consolidate their momentum. On the other hand WinterFox played a pretty great January, but they turned a bit inconsistent during mid-February. And lately they've struggled a bit more than expected, even against manageable opponents, such as Splyce and Enemy. However, Desi and co. still sport a rather decent firepower, and they should be able to offer a pretty balanced fight to NRG on most of the maps. In our opinion we believe we'll watch: de_cbble, de_cache and de_dust2. If the veto goes thus way, NRG may grab Cache, while both Dust2 and Cobblestone can go either way. Betting odds are currently too skewed in favor of NRG, while real-world are way more aligned to middle; so even if we believe that NRG have an edge, we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on WinterFox in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

At this point the first two of the three available spots have been claimed by [Liquid] and Tempo Storm, now only one remains. The last qualifier features arguably two of the top teams of NA, CLG and Cloud9. Lately, CLG has been less effective in online matches compared to what they've shown on LAN. They played well in their first few matches, and made it to the Qtr-Final seemingly in decent form, after struggling the ESL matches before the weekend. The encounter with Liquid was quite brief, as CLG's confidence was snatched by way of 16-1 and 16-4. This was extremely surprising when considering their performances of the past couple of weeks. Additionally, they've had some time to wait instead of being able to just forget about what just happened, and play the next game (as most of this tournament has gone). So that time left just waiting move forward could be a key variable in this matchup. Meanwhile C9 has been getting mixed results in the short term, some of their play has seemed a bit hesitant at times, but they still managed a strong effort. But they faced a Brazilian squad that have been tearing through much of the NA, and were in better form than C9 currently, and enter this decider match following a rather rough 3 map bout with Tempo Storm. The Brazilian side simply blew up on Dust2, and {Skadoodle] and friends had no answers. But they've one last chance qualify. As for the maps, theres good chances we'll se de_cache, de_train, and de_cbble. Provided the Veto goes this way, Cloud9 should be favored on Cache and Cobblestone, while train could go either way. Betting Odds are trending favor of C9, which agree on. After watch CLG choke as did against Liquid, we inclined to follow the trend. C9 didn't have the greatest showing before, but have the benefit of still being fresh and warmed up coming directly into this match. So they're our pick for a Low Bet.

Gamers2 are rolling into this match following quite a decent run at ESL Barcelona, where prior losing to Fnatic, they managed to take down Astralis. Overall the Frenchmen have always been quite decent with the BO1 format, so we're not surprised to watch them peaking. However, they surely have more issues in taking home games featuring the extended map pool. On the other hand, Mousesports took a couple of weeks off right after their victory at APM Finals, where they managed to beat FlipSid3 in the Grand-Final (but its worth noting that F3 had to play without Markeloff). Anyway, Mouz are one of the trending Tier2 teams, and if they're having a good day we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Germans offering a top-tier show. Anyways, this game is taking place on Dust2, a map where both teams have always displayed pretty high-end performances, so we're talking about a very balanced match where we might even watch some OT. Betting odds are trending in favor of the French side, and even if Scream and co. surely have an edge, we don't believe they should be around 60/40 but way more aligned to the middle. So at our end we're oriented in going Low on Mousesports in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/3928!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8332!$ATN!$Orgless!$null!$0.52!$0.63!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Aside from EPL games, we've also several CounterPit BO2s. Here we're reviewing the Tier-3 contest between ALTERNATE aTTaX and the former PixelFire roster, now known as Orgless. The Germans are moving here after just a single game played in the past week, and honestly not a really exciting one since they ended losing by measure against Vexed. But at least during APM Finals, they managed to setup encouraging things. Overall we've good vibes about this roster, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them hit Tier-2 by the end of the current Quarter. On the other hand, ex-PixelFire are one of the lineups to watch too. They are still kinda inconsistent, but over the short-term they already managed to deliver a couple of noticeable upsets against FSid3 and Ancient, prior to failing versus E-frag yesterday evening (but well, the Bulgarians aren't an easy team to face). Overall this is a pretty balanced matchup, and we might watch it end in a plain Tie. However, current betting odds are a bit too skewed in favor of Alternate, which we find kinda inaccurate, so we're prone toward attempting a Low pick on ex-PixelFire in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/3929!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8334!$mouz!$G2!$mouz!$0.45!$0.52!$-0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for both teams, and now we're moving to de_overpass. As we already discussed in the previous match, both these teams are rolling with pretty good momentum. Over the short-term, they've provided fairly aligned series of performances, in addition they're also quite good in BO1s, so we're expecting just another close game. While we have a lot of references on Dust2, since we've plenty of previous games, but things on Overpass are surely a bit more tricky to predict since both teams in the short-term favored Cobblestone over it. So guessing how they'll perform today is not going to be easy. Honestly we find the momentum of Gamers2 slightly stronger, and on a map such as Overpass, this may result in an edge for them. So we're oriented in attempting a Low pick on G2.
http://csgo.guru/match/3930!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8342!$EnVyUs!$VP!$VP!$0.6!$0.73!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$2nd batch of EPL matches, and another high level matchup, this time featuring EnVyUs and Virtus.Pro. Theres not too much say about the Frenchmen, who remain to be one of the best teams in the world. They'll enter this week after a decent showing at ESL Barcelona, where they were mainly paired up the elite of the event. There losses to Astralis and 2/3 against Fnatic saw Envy eliminated in the tournament. Overall, in the short-term, the French side have looked in good form and continued to beat most every team out there, with the Swedes being the only exclusion to defeat NV consecutively. Plus we're talking about Cobblestone, a map they've frequently achieved good results. Virtus.Pro on the hand, are currently experiencing serious problems, and come into this match on quite a rough losing streak. Except for a single map, we've yet to see the Poles take home the victory. And these struggles are occurring with mid-high tier teams. Whatever internal issues they're dealing with, are surely gonna need addressed soon, before we see the Org intervene. As for this contest, Cbble may not be the worst map for the Polish, but its one they've faced issues in handling even lower ranked teams. So we highly doubt this map and matchup will be what they need to turn things around. As expected, Betting Odds are mostly trashed in favor in the French, which is correct when considering everything mentioned above. Normally, we'd entertain an ICB in this situation, however, the margins of some of their losses are more concerning than the losses themselves. And we've really not seen anything to be encouraged by from them this year. So although they may sport the firepower to provide an upset, we doubt that come today with the Frenchmen in such strong form. So on our end, we're oriented towards skipping this match. But if you really want to bet, our pick EnvyUs.
http://csgo.guru/match/3931!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8341!$VP!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.4!$0.39!$0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The second half of this matchup and second game in a row for EnvyUs and VirtusPro, except this time we're moving over to Mirage. As discussed in the first game, Virtus.Pro are experiencing very troubling times, as they've accumulated a rather extensive losing streak going back prior to the holiday break. Even the last quarter of '15 revealed kinks in their armor. And honestly, they havent really been the threat we knew since late-summer, early fall. However, this trip Mirage offers slightly more promise than the entry map, since its a map theyve historically achieved good things on, including favorable outcomes when facing the Frenchmen. Meanwhile, EnVyUs never focused too much on Mirage in the past. However their visits on it seemed to be occurring with higher frequency, along with the accumulation of decent results on it. This includes wins over Fnatic, Dignitas, Astralis, and SK. So the map advantage in favor of Polish-side is surely less tilted than the number would reflect. Particularly when considering the consistency NV has performed over the short term. Once more the Betting Odds are trending in favor of the French-side. On our end, we inclined to agree, mainly due to the current state of the VP. Although they've had a little time to practice, while NV was traveling to Spain. So we certainly feel the Poles chances for a win are improved on this map. But we still find more confidence in NV for a Low Bet, unless the percentages reach the 80/20 ICB threshold, in which case we'd risk it on the higher reward for an ICB on VP.
http://csgo.guru/match/3932!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8343!$Penta!$Panters!$Penta!$0.52!$0.58!$-0.05999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another CounterPit contest, and this time we're featuring Penta against the old London Conspiracy roster, now known as PANTERS. The Norwegians yesterday managed to hit a Tie versus E-frag, surely a decent result since the Bulgarians are always tricky to face. But honestly PANTERS are missing a victory since a quite long while, and aside several Ties they seem unable to close their BO2/3 games. And this is quite an issue. On the other hand, Penta woke up a bit after changing Davidp with ZehN, but after a promising victory over FSid3, yesterday they fell again to ground against SK, in a pretty terrible game where the Germans failed to grab more than 10 rounds in two maps. As we stated above, we're talking about two pretty inconsistent rosters, so once again there are high chances to watch just a Tie. However, if we've to pick a side we find ex-London Conspiracy a bit more solid compared to Penta, so we're oriented in going Low on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/3933!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8339!$mouz!$NiP!$NiP!$0.45!$0.36!$0.09000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Third series of EPL matches, and now we're featuring a pretty great contest between Mousesports and NiP. The Swedes are currently on a pretty light schedule, and during this first part of the year they played just a very limited amount of matches, so guessing how they'll play this evening is surely quite hard. However, last week against Dignitas they managed to put up a surprisingly good show, so this is surely encouraging. on the other hand, Mousesports are hitting this match already well warmed up by their previous EPL matchup against Gamers2, and overall they are sporting a quite strong momentum, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a proper fight. Talking about the current game, on de_cache Mouz managed to deliver a couple of great performances during APM Finals, but worth noting that they didn't face T1 opponents on it, so things will be different today. About NiP, they never looked extremely convincingly on this map, and this year they played it just two times, with quite poor results, so they're a bit of a question mark. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of NiP, so at our end we're prone in attempting a Low- pick on Mousesports, since we believe we'll watch a quite tight match.
http://csgo.guru/match/3934!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8340!$NiP!$mouz!$NiP!$0.55!$0.54!$0.010000000000000009!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second EPL match in a row for NiP, 4th in a row for Mousesports and basically the last EU match of this evening. We already discussed the form of these rosters in the previous game, so now we'll just add that here on de_overpass things will be a real mess to guess. Both teams aren't playing this map since November 2015 and aside a single match that Mouz played during APM Finals, these lineups basically never really focused on this map, favoring Cobblestone over it. Honestly this is a kind of game where aim and experience can make a real difference, and unless Mouz are hiding an ace in their sleeve we find NiP advantaged over the Germans. However we're still talking about a really risky match, so we suggest to avoid high values, additionally betting odds aren't really amazing too, so you should evaluate a plain skip. But well, we know that skipping a great game like this one is basically cutting away the fun... so at our end we're prone in going Low on NiP, with the hope to watch them focused enough.
http://csgo.guru/match/3935!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8344!$E-Frag!$SK!$null!$0.45!$0.27!$0.18!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving back over to CounterPit for another high-mid tiered matchup, and a pretty interesting one. E-frag has been one been one of the busier teams in the early stages of the year, competing in quite a range mixed tiered contests. During this time they've continued to cement themselves as a solid T2 team, but they're still a little ways off from making a push towards the top tier. The Bulgarians enter today after a pretty strong start to the week yesterday, where they swept ex-PixelFire 2-0, and a tie with London Conspiracy after a very tight OT loss to prevent the second consecutive sweep. Granted, we're not talking about extremely highend contests, but these are the games that lend to their reliability and consistency. SK on the other hand, have stepped up their game another notch, and have been quite a revelation in recent weeks. This most notably includes their 2 map sweep of Natus Vincere in week 2 of EPL. Overall, the Danish teams have been quite impressive this year, along with Dignitas, SK is surely making a strong case for their push to join the top Tier. As for this mid-tiered contest, we should good show to watch, although the Danes are mostly playing a level of E-Frag, so we're currently seeing the Betting Odds rolling favor on SK. On our we're inclined to agree, particularly after the convincing scores the Danish-side put up yesterday. So we're oriented towards a skip on this case, since we highly doubt the Bulgarians can manage to take two maps in a row from the Danes. With the worst case scenario of a seeing a Tie, our side to pick remains SK.
http://csgo.guru/match/3937!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8347!$Empire!$CW!$CW!$0.45!$0.38!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Honestly not much to say about this match. CPH Wolves are heading into this game after about two weeks where they fielded stand-ins for Gla1ve and Hunden, so this is going to be their first game featuring the 'official' roster since a while, and will be interesting see how they'll perform. On the other hand, Empire sill have a long journey ahead in order to grab a T3 spot, the roster it self is surely interesting, but the lack of proper strats make them heavily vulnerable to low-end opponents, so we have serious concerns about their performances on the extended map-pool, in particular against a team featuring very experienced players such as CPHW. Betting odds are still quite decent, so at our end we're oriented in taking the safest path by going Low on CPH Wolves, with the hope to watch them sporting their full firepower now they don't have to mess with stand-ins anymore.
http://csgo.guru/match/3942!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8368!$Ence!$ATN!$Ence!$0.52!$0.59!$-0.06999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We're kicking-off the day with quite an interesting low-tier CounterPit match. After a couple of terrible weeks, ENCE finally managed to step up their game a bit, and in the past few days they hit a couple of Ties and a victory over Vexed. Surely promising, even if the Finns are still floating way below their full potential. Honestly, according to the level of their roster they should be able to deal with T2 teams instead of struggling against T3 ones. A fter a start with the pedal to the metal culminated with a decent show at APM Finals, ALTERNATE aTTaX on the other hand, slowed their run down a bit. During the 2nd half of February, thry collected a couple of heavy losses versus Vexed and E-Frag, so they're entering this match with the hopes to jump back on track. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of ENCE, mostly because their latest victory over Vexed, but this isn't really correct. Real-world odds are more aligned to the middle, additionally we have a pretty high risk of seeing just a Tie. On our end, we're oriented in going Low on ALTERNATE aTTaX in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/3943!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8354!$Gambit!$CSGL!$CSGL!$0.52!$0.46!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite an interesting low-tier contest. If you missed it, Gambit is the former HS.GG roster, basically a team mostly composed by former HR players, and featuring Dosia, Mou, Adren together with Hooch and the super-promising newcomer WayLander. So we're talking about a lineup that on paper has a quite high potential, and we highly suggest to keep your eyes on them. However, they mostly played within the CIS scene so far, so evaluating them from an International point-of-view isn't really easy, and basically this is going to be one of they very first tests. On the other hand CSGL is always a pretty unpredictable team, in the short-term they took home a mixed bag of results and their gameplay is still extremely momentum based and prone to random peaks, so even if skill-wise they are quite fine, we still have serious concerns about their performances on the extended map-pool and in BO3s in general. Additionally they also just switched Oskarish for Minise, even if we're prone to consider this change as a pretty light one. Talking about this match, we're expecting to watch: de_mirage, de_cache and de_cbble. If the veto goes this way Mirage should be in favor of CSGL, while Gambit may have an edge on both Cache and Cobblestone. Currently Betting Odds are trending in favor of Dosia and co. and at our end we're prone to agree, so we are oriented in going Low on Gambit.
http://csgo.guru/match/3944!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8358!$Na'Vi!$NiP!$Na'Vi!$0.52!$0.63!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Opening batch of ESL Pro League matches, and we're starting with one of the most interesting contests of the evening. Yesterday NiP managed to continue their positive EPL winning streak after taking down Dignitas a week ago, rolling over Mousesports as well. Worth saying that against the Germans they had to sweat way more, compared to their game against the Danes. To be honest, Mouz probably deserved to win at least a map for the effort they put in the match, however Overtimes are always tricky, and for winning them experience matters more than the heart. On the other hand Natus Vincere somehow managed to lose against SK, but then bounced back with a 2-0 victory over Virtus.Pro. This pattern may look weird, but it's a big classic for GuardiaN and friends. NAVI always had the issues of underestimating low-tier opponents, ignoring that some of these lineups are actually a real threat (such as SK). However, their real face is the one we watched versus VP, so we've good vibes for their game against NiP. Talking about the current match, de_train is a map where both teams always played well, so basically we're talking about a pure 50/50 game, with just a little edge in favor of NAVI due their recent strong form. However betting odds are currently a bit too skewed in favor of the Ukrainians, so we're moreso oriented in attempting a Low pick on NiP, since we find they have better chances here than in the following map.
http://csgo.guru/match/3945!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8359!$NiP!$Na'Vi!$NiP!$0.45!$0.38!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for both rosters, and now we're moving to a map where Natus Vincere should have a more solid edge over NiP. We already discussed the form of these teams in the previous half of this EPL contest, so we'll just add that Mirage always been one of the NAVI signature maps, where they generally provided good shows. So unless there are some surprises, they should be able to deal with NiP decently. On the other hand NiP have been vetoing Mirage for a quite long time. Even if lately they've started focusing on it again (with mixed results), their experience on it is averagely lower compared to NAVI, so we'll likely watch them having issues in counter-stratting the very aggressive NAVI T side. Betting odds here are even more skewed in favor of GuardiaN &amp; co. than the previous game, but honesty this is kinda correct. So we're oriented in sticking with a Low pick on NAVI as well.
http://csgo.guru/match/3946!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8360!$Astralis!$VP!$Astralis!$0.58!$0.7!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second set of EPL matches, and another top-tier contest. After a pretty terrible first part of the year, where Virtus.Pro basically collected only defeats and disappointing performances, finally displayed some wake-up signs against EnVyUs yesterday. Even if they won just one map out of the two, this time scores were in-line with previously typical VP level, so we're prone toward believing that they started their comeback, and in a couple of weeks we may finally watched them display full-power. On the other hand, Astralis are doing decently. They aren't sporting their full potential yet, but they are slowly getting closer, event after event. However, they've been quite solid so far, and in the short-term they mostly played on par with the rest of Tier-1 teams. Talking about this game, the map is de_overpass, and here the Danes have generally provided quite convincing results during this first Quarter of the year. So we're prone toward giving them an edge over VP. Betting odds are still decent for a Low pick on Astralis, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/3948!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8361!$VP!$Astralis!$Astralis!$0.45!$0.3!$0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Both teams are now heading into the 2nd contest, but taking place on de_cache this time round. We already talked about the current form of these rosters in the previous game, so now we'll just add that on this map, we're expecting a tighter game compared to the first one. Cache has always been a good map for Virtus.Pro, so the upset chances are surely higher, compared to Overpass. Particularly since this is also one of the few maps where Astralis didn't focus on too much in this first part of the year, so even if they are currently sporting a better form, they'll have to sweat if VP manages to setup what they delivered yesterday against Envy. Betting odds here a bit more balanced compared to the previous matchup, but still quite skewed in favor of the Danes, so since we believe we'll watch a close match, we're oriented in attempting a Low pick on Virtus.Pro in order to take advantage of the higher profit.

Fnatic are without a doubt the trending team in this first part of the year (not news tbh). They are rolling into this game right after their triumph at ESL Barcelona, where they managed to take down Astralis in the Grand-Final. There isn't much else to say about the Swedes, aside that they're currently the team to beat. On the other hand, SK has made an impressive step forward over quite a short time. They really stepped up as team and performance-wise they're actually looking pretty aligned with consolidated T2 teams, such as Dignitas and Mousesports. So we're talking about a roster that can still provide some troubles, even if still below the level of Fnatic. About the current match, de_overpass has always been a good map for Fnatic. As on LAN, we've generally watched them playing very well. So even if SK used to be decent on it as well, we doubt we'll watch Flusha and co. losing it, so our pick is a Low+/Avg- on Fnatic.

Over the short-term, they probably stepped up a tiny bit, but overall they are still a huge question mark and also a team with serious issues with the extended map-pool. On the other hand, E-Frag are surely on a better run. They had a performance drop during early February, but since in the past week they started delivering rather decent shows again. The Tie they managed to hit yesterday against SK is surely promising. Overall E-frag should be a quite reliable pick, and in the worst case, we'll likely just watch a Tie. However, betting odds aren't really amazing, and honestly with so many good matches around you should just evaluate a skip for this one. But if you really want to pick a side, our suggestion is to go with a Low+ bet on E-Frag.

While we're not expecting any huge surprises from the previous contest, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a closer fight here on de_cache. Generally Fnatic have always provided good shows on this map as well, but lately they've had some stutters on it (against Envy) that could have exposed some kinks in their armor, so if SK can manage to take advantage of what EnVyUs exposed, we might watch a game getting near scores that may lead to Overtime. Surely there aren't any great chances to see SK perfectly counter the Swedes as the Frenchmen did, but honestly the Danes already delivered something similar against NAVI, so we're aware this is something they can accomplish if they try hard. Betting odds are currently trashed in favor of Fnatic, and as usual when we talk about 90/10 percentages there is no point in picking the favored team, so instead we'll just try our luck with an ICB on SK.

The remnants of the former Method team, became the promising EU/NA mix of NRG. Since the teams inception, they've pretty quickly joined the mess of mid-tiered NA teams closely competing at the same level. They'll be coming into these matches following a 2-1 solid win over Wfx last night. Meanwhile Liquid has continued trying to find the perfect combination of players, recently adding Koosta from NME to their roster. And in the short-term, they've finally seemed to shake their early year fog, and began playing as the T1 NA team we watched much of last year. The other night they handed CLG stunning loss, with margins holding CLG to a mere 5 rounds through two maps. Surely the most encouraging show of the year. As for this 1st game, we're going to Dust2. We haven't seen NRG as constructed too much yet, but the fews show we saw from them were mostly solid. But likewise, Liquid has achieved much better results on it recently than they used, so we feel they're moreso the more reliable pick. But since Betting Odds are already so skewed in their favor, we're oriented towards trying our luck with ICB on NRG for the greater profit (and the greater risk).
http://csgo.guru/match/3955!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8377!$Liquid!$NRG!$Liquid!$0.55!$0.75!$-0.19999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Second match in a row for both teams, but now we're moving to Cobblestone where things are getting even more tricky, since we're talking about a map both teams never really focused on during the current Quarter. Despite having a long history on this map, in the past months Liquid played it just one time in early February, providing kinda questionable results. On the other hand NRG never really played it before, so guessing their current level is nearly impossible. However since we're mostly talking about two rosters who both focused little on this map, the upset chances are surely quite high, and again we wouldn't be surprised to watch a match much closer than expected. Betting odds are also currently trashed in favor of Liquid for this map, but still moving a lot, so we suggest waiting a bit before placing your bet. Anyways, if the percentages stay around these values (80/20), we're once more oriented towards attempting an ICB on NRG, with the hope of watching the EU/NA mix set up some good things.

As we've discussed plenty of times already, OpTic is one of the NA teams we're watching closely with high expectations for a breakthrough year. However they got off to a rocky start since Road2Vegas, and just recently starting getting closer back the form they achieved during the last Quarter. Overall, they're still a little ways off from their previous level. We recently watched Tempo Storm humble the Canadians on Cbble 16-1, following a mostly competitive 2 maps. So they surely have some things to work on to make that resurgence. AGG on the hand, is still getting similar results as they did under SKDC, where other than a kinda random pair of strong games last weekend, they've fallen in a majority of their contests. Additionally, the history of this Canadian Derby has been tilted in favor of OpTic. With consideration to the random fails of ShahZam and the gang, we wouldn't be surprised if AGG managing to grab a map or generally setup a closer game than the current odds are reflecting. As far as the Veto goes, theres good chances we'll watch de_train, de_mirage, and de_cache. Should we see these picks, Train and Cache should favor OpTic, while Mirage could go either way. As implied above, Betting Odds are mostly trashed in favor of OpTic. So this is likely a good match to skip with such little reward. But if you still wanna pick, an Avg Bet on the promising OpTic squad is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/3958!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8374!$Torpedo!$Orgless!$Torpedo!$0.4!$0.4!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite an interesting Challenger match between two teams who in the short-term are frequently delivering above-average performances. The former PixelFire squad, now known as 'Orgless' have lately dropped a bit in consistency, but overall they've proven to be capable of dealing with T2 teams in pretty good fashion. Even if they fell yesterday under the shots of E-frag, they still managed to grab a Tie against ALTERNATE aTTaX avoiding to turn the day into a totally bad one. On the other hand Torpedo has mostly faced low-end teams during the past week, but early in the month they also took down ENCE and tied a game with CPH Wolves. Which are surely a promising set of results. Here we're talking about a BO2, and at our end we're oriented in giving an edge to ex-PixelFire, since they should be slightly more reliable than Torpedo and don't believe we'll watch Barbarr and co. losing two maps in a row, so in the worst case we should watch just a Tie. Either way, our pick is Low on Orgless.
http://csgo.guru/match/3959!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8376!$Ence!$CW!$Ence!$0.55!$0.7!$-0.1499999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite an enjoyable Nordic derby between two teams who've lately stepped up a bit. After a pretty terrible January, ENCE finally managed to reboot their minds and started delivering performances on par with their pretty good lineup. In the past few days the Finns put together a decent streak of good results, and both their games against Vexed and ALTERNATE aTTaX, they handled the opposition in a pretty convincing manner. Prior to these couple of games, they also hit a Tie against CPH Wolves, but back in the day the Danes were still playing with 2 stand-ins, so this result should be scrapped as a reference. However, CPH Wolves are now rolling into this match with their full roster, so we're expecting them to display a slight bump in performance, and baseed on what they displayed yesterday against Empire, it looks like the Danish side is fully capable of delivering a close fight. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch this game hit the third map. About the veto, in our opinion we'll watch: de_cache, de_cbble and de_dust2 as maps. If we nailed it, Cache should be in favor of CPHW, while Cobblestone will likely go to ENCE, leaving Dust2 which may end either way. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on ENCE, so we're oriented in taking this path since in the short-term they've looked slightly more promising than CPHW.
http://csgo.guru/match/3960!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8381!$Astralis!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.45!$0.26!$0.19!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$We're kicking-off the day with a pretty amazing BO5 Showmatch, featuring a 5,000 EUR prize-pool. Fnatic are moving here on a the customary winning streak. Aside from taking home the ESL Barcelona trophy, the Swedes also maintained their top-notch momentum by rolling over SK in their latest EPL contest. Overall Flusha and friends, are simply continuing their series of ongoing good results since Fall 2015, further demonstarting themselves as the reference team within the Tier-1. On the other hand, after a slow start to the year, Astralis finally moved back to a performance level aligned with their potential. Even if there is still some margin for improvement. During ESL Barcelona they managed to hit the final stage of the event, but they dropped the ball against Fnatic. However, just like their Swedish rivals they continued performing well in their following online games too, beating Virtus.Pro by measure. Talking about the current match, at our end we're oriented in giving an edge to Fnatic because they are generally more reliable on the extended map-pool, and despite possibly losing one or two maps in the process, they should be still be capable of keeping a slight step ahead Astralis. However, we must note that the current betting odds are just trash, and honestly looking at these percentages when two Top-Tier rosters are playing is always kinda cringeworthy. So even if we truly believe that Fnatic can take home the match, we don't see any good reason for not attempting an ICB on Astralis as far as the values will keep floating around 20/80.

Liquid had an extremely slow January, mostly filled by pretty disappointing results, but in the short-term they stepped up a lot and now they are moving here on decent winning streak. However, worth noting that for this event they're fielding adreN instead of Koosta (who will stand-in for his former team, Enemy), and this may cause them a slightly sluggish start since Liquid performances improved mostly because his addition. On the other hand, HellRaisers aren't really the most consistent team out there, and even if they managed to qualify for this event, during the past week they mostly delivered kinda disappointing shows, losing against both ALTERNATE aTTaX and FlipSid3. However, here we're talking about a BO1, so things aren't written in stone, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch a close game, in particular if we'll see de_dust2 or de_overpass as map. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on Liquid, so we're oriented in taking this path, mostly because we find their momentum slightly stronger than the HR one.
http://csgo.guru/match/3969!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8387!$G2!$TStorm!$G2!$0.55!$0.7!$-0.1499999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$The first big match of this MLG Columbus Qualifier, and a game we're really looking forward to watching. Tempo Storm in the short-term have been an impressive step ahead, and basically evolved quickly into the 2nd best team in North America, right after their big brothers from Luminosity. The Brazilians are actually sitting on a really stunning winning streak, and aside from the victories, they are sporting a style of play that can be potentially dangerous to a wide part of the European teams taking part at this event. However, Gamers2 aren't newcomers, and they've come oversea after delivering a pretty convincing show at ESL Barcelona. An event that should have prepared them well for the BO1s they are going to play today. On paper, they should have an edge over Tempo Storm, but the opening matches are always a bit tricky, and playing without clear references could also turn into an issue, so we're expecting a pretty tight game where we wouldn't be surprised to see an OT as well. Betting odds are in favor of the EU side, but honestly things should be quite balanced. So at our end, we're oriented in attempting a Low- pick on Tempo Storm in order to take advantage of the pretty sweet percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/3970!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8391!$Selfless!$FSid3!$FSid3!$0.45!$0.3!$0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not such an easy match to predict. For this event, Enemy are again fielding Koosta, which is surely a positive thing since he'll bring back some much needed fire-power, and will also re-balance a roster that over recent weeks have turned from being quite reliable to quite inconsistent. However, despite the short-term lineup issues, Enemy are still one of the NA teams that have provided their best performances in this first part of the year. St their peak, they were playing on par with most of the North American powerhouses, so they shouldn't be underestimated, even if they surely lack the International experience. On the other hand, FlipSid3 are heading here with a mixed set of online results in the bag. But they at least played pretty well at the APM Finals, and overall we've a bit more faith in their LAN performances when compared those Online. However, we might watch Markeloff and friends having issues during the first half, since the BO1 format isn't the best for a team whose typically been a bit slow in reading the opponent. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Ukrainians, and we're prone to agree since we find them more experienced on the International field, so we're oriented in picking a Low bet on FlipSid3.

Lately, SK are experiencing a golden moment. They've stepped up a lot, and what they managed to deliver during these past weeks has surely been impressive (particularly the 2-0 over Natus Vincere), so they are stepping into this match with pretty high hopes. Generally the Danes always provided good shows in BO1s, so they should be able to navigate through the GroupStage without major issues. On the other hand, Vexed is a team that ALWAYS manages to qualify for Majors. This is even more impressive since they've never really provided consistent online performances, but in games that matter, they always managed to step-up and switch On the God-Like mode. Basically they're the 'dark-horse', and guessing what they'll setup is quite hard, particularly since Oskarish is standing-in for Hyper, which may bring some instability to the roster. Betting odds are overly skewed in favor of SK, and currently not really amazing for going with the Danes. Despite believing we'll watch Friis and co. take home the victory, we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on Vexed.
http://csgo.guru/match/3973!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8390!$CLG!$Splyce!$Splyce!$0.58!$0.79!$-0.21000000000000008!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Our first North American derby, and a game that should end without huge surprises. CLG are actually the greatest hope for NA. Over the short-term, they haven't done exceptionally, but overall they're pretty balanced as team. And as a plus, they are one of the few rosters that avoided the winter-shuffle. During the DH Malmo Qualifier, held few days ago, they did pretty well. Together with Liquid, they are the teams that provided the most convincing performances. On the other hand, SPLYCE aren't the scariest opponent out there. In the short-term, they achieved a pretty long streak of disappointing results, and overall during February they looked kinda inconsistent. So even if the BO1 format may lend them a little hand, we highly doubt we'll watch Abe and co. taking down CLG. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of CLG, but honestly we're prone to agree, so CLG is our pick for an Avg- bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/3974!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8392!$Dignitas!$Renegades!$Renegades!$0.58!$0.77!$-0.19000000000000006!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy game to predict since Renegades are always pretty hard to classify in a tier. Generally their performances vary from event to event, without following a precise pattern. Overall they are a quite momentum-based team, which we observed just a week ago. Right after trashing CLG in their EPL games, they ended up losing early in the DH Malmo Qualifier that took place just few days later. So guessing how they'll play today is kinda hard. On the other hand, Dignitas, together with Mousesports and SK, are some of the EU teams who've improved the most in the early part of the year. Over the short-term, they managed to take down several big names, and they've always fielded a pretty good firepower backed by a solid set of strats. So they're surely one of the favored teams for moving through this event. Betting odds are already skewed in favor of Dignitas, but still decent for going Low+ on them, so we're oriented in sticking with them (Dignitas), since we don't find the Australian roulette a very reliable pick.

Both teams are sporting huge potential with pretty good rosters, but they're still struggling in taking home decisive results. Cloud9 didn't really improve after the addition of Stewie2k. They've kept experiencing issues against most of the other NA powerhouses, and aside from a couple of victories over low-end teams they haven't achieve anything relevant in the short-term. On the other hand, Gambit followed a somewhat similar pattern. Despite delivering good shows within the CIS scene, they never really managed to replicate these against mid-tier EU opponents, so they are not stepping here with the highest hopes either. Overall we're prone toward giving an edge to Cloud9, mostly because they're playing on their home soil and because they've extended experience in these kind of International matches. But there are surely chances to watch a game closer than expected. Betting odds are still quite balanced, so our pick is a Low one on Cloud9.

Enemy, currently playing as 'Selfless' were rejoined by Koosta for the duration of the MLG competition, but didn't offer the added firepower we expected. Meanwhile Bondik shined for FlipSid3, forcing NME into this fight to stay alive. But prior to the qualifier, Relyks and the rest of the gang had finally looked to regain some of the form they achieved earlier in the year. On the other side, Tempo Storm fought one of yesterday's best matches in a back n forth scrap with G2. For a better part of the match, Tempo controlled the action. Unfortunately, after a perfectly timed timeout, the Frenchmen stole the momentum late, along with the map. Despite the loss, this highend match showed the level the Brazil-side is playing currently. Much like they've shown in the past few weeks. And honestly, we have to view them as the favored to advance from this bout. Betting Odds are mostly trashed already in favor of Tempo Storm, but this is far from a runaway for them. It was only earlier this month NME took a BO3 in the Winter Classic. So although we feel the Brazilians should be able take it, we're talking about a BO1, where things are little more random, (so unless you want to skip), we're oriented in trying our luck for a quite rewarding Low-ICB on Enemy.
http://csgo.guru/match/3983!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8401!$FSid3!$G2!$G2!$0.42!$0.19!$0.22999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second MLG match of the day, except this time, the stakes are for a spot in the upcoming Columbus Major in Apri, and quite an interesting matchup between two teams coming off of pretty strong entry games. Much like what they showed at APM, FlipSid3 continued to perform well on LAN. However, both off and online, the Ukrainians have always experienced repeated issues with high level teams. So we've concerns about them managing the Frenchmen in a BO1, particularly after seeing NME almost comeback late, where F3 usually excels. On the other hand, Gamers2 were the first to test Tempo Storm, one of the hottest NA teams in their opening match. which, as we mentioned earlier, was one of yesterday's most exciting contest. despite being behind for much of the game, G2 kept their composure, and eventually they managed to surprise the Brazilians with an incredible retake that ultimately turned the momentum and stole the map. Overall a pretty impressive show by the Frenchmen to start their weekend. Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of the French-side, which we agree on. Based on the form they showed Day 1, coupled with F3's troubles with high ranked teams, we surely see them as the more reliable pick. So our pick is Low Bet on Gamers2 to claim the next Major spot.
http://csgo.guru/match/3984!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8408!$Liquid!$HR!$Liquid!$0.52!$0.62!$-0.09999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Both teams already faced each other yesterday in their opening game, and we enjoyed an extremely beautiful contest that reached multiple OTs. So today we're expecting another extremely balanced matchup. HellRaisers after winning the Overtime over Liquid, faced Mouz in their following game. Here we enjoyed another great match with another OT as well. Unfortunately for HR, the Germans were a bit more fresh and managed to close the game sending Kucher and co. off to face the North American side one more time. On the other hand, after losing their entry game, the NA side had to deal with YP. But they dismissed them in a rather easy fashion without even breaking a sweat. Talking about the current game, we're now messing with a BO3. Here we're expecting to watch de_dust2, de_overpass and de_cache as map. If we nailed the veto, Dust2 should be mostly 50/50, while Cache may end in favor of Liquid, while HR should have an edge on Overpass. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Liquid, but honestly we find it kinda weird, especially considering how close their previous matchup was. Even if we're now talking about a BO3, and the NA side is generally a bit more consistent on the extended map-pool, we still have a relatively even matchup. Overall we're mostly talking about a contest that can easily go either way, so at our end we're oriented in picking a Low bet on HellRaisers due the more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/3985!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8410!$Vexed!$Splyce!$Splyce!$0.55!$0.7!$-0.1499999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite the unexpected winner's match since both rosters entered their opening matches as underdogs. But its worth noting that Vexed are kinda used to these kinds of shows, and have already qualified for two Majors in similar style. However, this time their performance was even more impressive since they're also fielding a stand-in (Oskarish instead of Hyper). So what they put up against SK was surely surprising, particularly based on the level of the shows the Danes delivered in the short-term. On the other hand, SPLYCE setup a miracle as well. A day prior, CLG were considered to be one the biggest hopes from the NA scene to reach the next Major. But things didn't really go that way. Instead Arya and co. shut down the CLG ambitions quite early, took all the momentum, and rolled over them in stunning fashion thanks to an extremely well organized and aggressive gameplay. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of the Polish side, and honestly based on what we watched in the past, we're prone to agree, so our pick is a Low+ bet on Vexed.
http://csgo.guru/match/3986!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8409!$SK!$CLG!$CLG!$0.55!$0.62!$-0.06999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This was surely the expected matchup, but not the matchup we expected to see for the Group C Elimination game. For their entry game with Vexed, SK was stunned by the Polish onslaught, and surrendered a 9 round defecit in the first half, digging a hole the Danes just couldn't come back from. Surely surprising, considering their overall form we've seen from Friis and friends in the short-term. However, Train has never been one of their best maps. Regardless, we highly doubt to see a similar performance with raised stakes. CLG on the other hand, have been and continue to be a bit of a question mark, with such a contrast in their performance levels. they had a couple decent online games prior to the qualifier, so confidence was on the rise. So they were favored in the opening match vs Splyce, who were in quite a rough patch. But Splyce went all in for the best of one, and CLG didn't respond well to the pressure. Although we anticipate a better showing here, we doubt they'll be able to match the Danes. Betting Odds are trending in favor of the EU side, the path we're oriented towards following. So as long as the percentages remain rewarding for a Low Bet on SK, we'll stay with the EU side.

Torpedo are moving here after a good streak of strong performances, and few days ago they also managed to take down the former PixelFire squad (now known as 'Orgless') in their CounterPit game. Surely the Swedes are playing better than expected, and overall they look pretty balanced and focused, but at our end we've some concerns about their LAN experience, and we wouldn't be surprised to see them failing to replicate what they delivered in their latest online matches. On the other hand ex-PixelFire, aside their latest couple of matches they generally always offered decent shows, so even if we're still talking about a kinda momentum based team, we consider them pretty promising, and they should be capable to setup decent things on most of the maps. Betting odds are still balanced, so at our end we're prone in picking a Low bet on Orgless, since we consider them slightly more reliable.
http://csgo.guru/match/3988!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8404!$Ence!$Ancient!$Ancient!$0.52!$0.7!$-0.17999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not the most consistent match out there, since we're talking about a BO1 between two teams that in the mid-term showed some limits. ENCE lately stepped up a bit, but they still played a pretty terrible January and even during their latest LAN event (Assembly Winter) they looked kinda off, despite they were also playing on their home soil and versus manageable opponents. On the other hand, Ancient are mostly a mix and in the past weeks several stand-ins rotated in their roster, today they're playing with Lekr0 as fifth. Honestly on LAN Pronax and co. might perform a bit better compared to online, but according to what they displayed so far, we can't mark term as a reliable pick yet. Betting odds are still decent for a Low pick on ENCE, so we're oriented in taking this path, mostly because we find the Finns more structured than the Swedes.
http://csgo.guru/match/3990!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8415!$ATN!$Torpedo!$ATN!$0.52!$0.64!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This is the last Pantamera match we'll cover for now, and here we're messing with yet another pretty balanced contest featuring two teams that never met before. However, we already discussed both rosters in the previous matchups, so there isn't much to add, other than the Swedes are looking promising but haven't been properly proven on LAN yet. Meanwhile the Germans should be capable of fielding more solid strat-based gameplay, even if aim-wise they are likely a slight step below the Swedish side. Overall betting odds are again pretty balanced, and again we're talking about a game that can easily go either way depending on the map picked. However, at our end we're trending in favor of a Low bet on Torpedo, since we believe that there are good chances we'll watch de_cbble as map.

However, these rosters managed to deliver an half-miracle in their opening games, and now they'll fight for a spot in the upcoming Major, so we're sure we'll watch a quite tight game. As we discussed before, Renegades and Gambit took different paths in their entry contests. While the Aussies looked more prone in countering/turtling, the CIS team focused more on quick and aggressive plays. Now comparing the two sides, we find pretty hard for Renegades countering a team such as Gambit, since the data available for setting up an effective countering is kinda scarce in most of the maps, so in an hypothetical condition where both lineups have to be aggressive, we find Dosia and co. slightly advantaged. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Renegades, but honestly we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game, so we're oriented in going Low on Gambit in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

Like SK, Dignitas also played the first part of the year extremely well, so they entered this Qualifier as one of the favored sides. Unfortunately for them, they've were paired with Renegades in their opening match. And the Aussies somehow managed to deliver one of their best games to date. Its also worth mentioning that there weren't many references about Renegades prior to this Qualifier, which they took advantage of and just focused on perfectly countering the Danish strats instead of attempting risky plays. Cloud9 had a similar fate, and basically their game against Gambit followed the same pattern of SK-Renegades. The only difference is that the CIS-side mostly focused on quick executions, and instead of turtling they just played really aggressively, without giving time for C9 to re-organize and adjust their plays. Simple but effective. Based on what we've watched so far, we honestly have more faith in Dignitas since we find the Danes more dynamic than the North American side, so we're prone in going for a Low pick on them.

Fortunately, today we move away from the kinda nonsense BO1s and feature the extended map-pool. As we often see with the single map format, yesterday was packed with many surprises and upsets, so hopefully today we'll enjoy more consistent results. We begin with the Group A Decider match, and quite an interesting and balanced EU/NA matchup. FlipSid3 have played fairly solid so far this weekend. After a slightly shaky entry game with NME, the Ukrainians had to deal with G2, who were surely sporting more firepower. The Frenchmen have been a bit more effective in their late-game executions than F3, but on the whole, they set up some good things in a pretty solid performance. So despite the loss, Markeloff and the gang look be reaching a decent form. Much like the CIS-side, Tempo Storm also fell short against G2 in their entry game, but also made the Frenchmen sweat quite a bit to take the map. That same level of play arrived yesterday with elimination on the line, as the Brazilians steam-rolled Selfless/NME with lethal precision 16-4. We've already spoke to promise the Brazilians have shown this year, and are now looking poised to reach their first Major. As mentioned, we'll get to enjoy a BO3, with good chances of watching de_cache, de_inferno, and de_mirage. If the Veto reflects this pattern, Cache should advantage F3, Inferno should favor Tempo, and Mirage could go either way. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of the Brazilians, which is correct based on the momentum they've built this year. On our end, we're prone to agree, so we're going Low on Tempo Storm to be the next representative to play in the Million Dollar Major.

These rosters had rather similar journeys so far, and surprisingly they both fell short against SPLYCE, despite on paper they should've been able to deal with them in relativey easy fashion. But well, the BO1 hell is always quite prone to these kinds of shows, so we aren't really that surprised. However, aside from the shock suffered in their opening match, CLG managed to redeem themselves by upsetting SK, which is surely not an easy task to take home based on how well the Danes played over the short-term. On the other hand Vexed, started with the pedal to the metal, and after rolling over SK as well, a Major spot looked almost within their grasp, but SPLYCE didn't agree, and delivered one of their best shows to date, sending the Poles to this Decider. Talking about the current game, we're expecting to watch de_mirage, de_overpass and de_train. If we nailed the Veto, CLG should be advantaged on Overpass, while Vexed will likely grab Train, and Mirage is going to be the huge question mark. Betting odds are currently overly skewed in favor of CLG, and while the NA side may have an edge, we don't find these percentages representative of a match that should surely be pretty tight, with good chances to feature some OTs and the 3rd map. So at our end, we're more prone toward attempting an ICB on Vexed rather than going Avg on CLG.

As we already mentioned yesterday, Ancient are playing with Lekr0 instead of DevilWalk, and according to all the stand-ins they fielded during the past weeks as well, we're prone toward considering them more as a mix rather than a real complete team. However, at Pantamera they've done pretty well so far, even if they didn't face any really scary opponents yet, with basically their only notable show being the quite impressive comeback against ENCE. Overall, we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Swedes doing fine here, even if the BO3 format may create more troubles for them than the BO1s. On the other hand, ALTERNATE aTTaX had to go tough a set of way more solid opponents; AliGon, Orgless and Torpedo aren't really easy teams to deal with, in particular on LAN. So the Germans are rolling into this contest carrying some good momentum on their backs. At our end, we're prone to giving them a little edge since they are looking a bit more organized compared to Ancient. About maps, we're expecting to watch: de_cache, de_overpass and de_train. If the Veto goes this way, Cache should be in favor of Alternate, while Train may go to Ancient and Overpass is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are still balanced, so on our end we're inclined to picking a Low bet on ALTERNATE aTTaX, since we find the Germans a bit more solid that the Swedish mix, but we'll likely watch a close match lasting for 3 maps.

Renegades had a pretty good start by beating Dignitas in their entry game, and they apparently looked close to grabbing a Major spot, since Gambit looked like a more manageable opponent. But instead the Aussies ended in a 'mirror' match, and the Dosia's gang took advantage of their higher firepower taking home the ticket for MLG Columbus. On the other hand Cloud9 had a pretty slow start, and surprisingly they couldn't manage to setup anything good in their opening match versus Gambit either. The North American side got everything wrong, and failed to respond properly to the quick plays that the CIS side were delivering. Luckily for them, the following match went a bit better, and they dismissed a quite shaky Dignitas 16-13, who looked pretty off throughout the whole event. About the current match, we're prone toward giving a slight edge to Cloud9, since we find them a bit more reliable with the BO3 format, compared to the Aussies. Particularly if we see de_inferno, de_cache and de_cbble. A set of maps where C9 should be advantaged on. With the only exclusion being Inferno, where things are going to be kinda balanced. Betting odds are still pretty decent for going Low on Cloud9, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/3999!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8423!$Orgless!$Ancient!$Ancient!$0.52!$0.4!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Honestly we were expecting a slightly closer Semi-Final, since ALTERNATE aTTaX had a pretty good run prior to getting destroyed by Ancient in their previous match. However, these kind of low-end tournaments are always a bit unpredictable. Anyways, aside from the impressive show delivered by the Swedes in their last game, we've to say that the former PixelFire squad, now known as Orgless, had a pretty good show as well. Despite falling against ALTERNATE aTTaX during the BO1s madness, they still managed to take down AliGon, Torpedo, and the Danish mix Preparation. Overall they mostly offered promising stuff. About this match, we're expecting to watch de_cache, de_overpass and de_cbble. If the veto will take this path, Ancient should have an edge on Cobblestone, while Orgless may grab Cache, and Overpass can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Ancient, largely because of the great show they displayed in the semis. But honestly, this is a kind of a 50/50 matchup, so we're oriented in going Low on Orlgess in order to attempt to grab the higher reward.

The first of the opening matches for this BO1 hell, features a pretty interesting matchup between Mousesports and NiP. Mouz has a had a decent start to the year, playing pretty consistently at a high T2 level, and have certainly made a strong case as a T1 prospect. At APM Finals, we watched the Germans dominate the field without losing a single map. So theres no question regarding their LAN capabilities, though here they'll surely have a more difficult path to travel, beginning with the Swedes who managed to to edge them out, twice, online last week for EPL. NiP on the other hand, have actually been one of the least active T1 teams of this first Quarter. However, to some surprise, the downtime seems to have had little to no affect, on their effectiveness and executions. But this will be their first LAN appearance of the year, so we wouldn't be too surprised to see them going through a small period of adjustment moving offline. Overall, F0rest and friends are good form entering the week, backed by a series of encouraging results. Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Swedes, which is correct, especially since they've already topped the Germans in their first two meeting this year. But Real-World Odds are way closer to even than the percentages we're seeing right now. Although they manged to wins those contests, but by the slimmest of margins, including some OT. On our end, we're inclined to pick the Swedes as well. But if the percentages reach 75/25, we're oriented toward trying our luck with an ICB on Mousesports, in hopes they take advantage of some NiP LAN rust for their entry game.

What else is there to say about Fnatic that hasn't been said already. Olofmeister and the gang return to LAN following a very impressive 3-0 sweep of Astralis last week for the 'Fight Night', which surely squashed any debate over the Danes being a threat to the Crown. Additionally, the Swedes have have only lost two maps so far this year, both of which againstEnVyUs. And neither of those matches featured high stakes. So they, (as usual) are the favorites for another Grand-Final appearance, and their potential second big trophy of the year. As implied above, Natus Vincere on the other hand, are amongst the few teams out there sporting a lineup strong enough the contest the Top seed. Guardian and friends also have a 2016 trophy on the shelf (DH Leipzig), but would surely hope to to be the first to grab their second. Unlike the Swedes, Navi have had a few more stumbles this year, but most of that has come online. But when moving offline, the CIS-side surely seem to step up a level, and will surely be looking for retribution against Fnatic, for being eliminated from StarSeries XIV Finals. As for this match, the current Betting Odds are overly skewed in favor of the Swedes. But we need to remember we're only talking a BO1, so this much more balanced than the percentages are reflecting. On our end, we too give the obvious edge to fnatic, but Real-World odds are only 52/48 in their favor. Additionally, the Swedes reserve a lot til the stakes go up, so we wouldn't be surprised to see NaVi testing them in this entry game. So we moreso oriented in risking the more rewarding pick on Natus Vincere for a Low bet, in hopes of a less reserved showing from them.

Coming into Katowice, NaVi had a somewhat bumpy series of online EPL performances. Most recently going 1-1 with NiP, who've been playing very well so far this year. But as we mentioned in their last game, when it comes to LAN performances, their play surely steps up notch; grabbing the trophy in Leipzig, and finishing runner-up in Minsk for the StarSeries XIV, where they managed a 2-0 sweep of EnVyUs in semis. So we've high expectations from them here as well. Meanwhile, Luminosity arrive following a few decent online wins over compLexity and Liquid. But they'll additionally carry with them a grudge, since they've fallen victim to NaVi in several high stakes LAN battles. Most recently being DreamHack Leipzig, where the brazilians' underdog run to the Grand-Final was met with disappointment, as they had to settle for 2nd place, courtesy of a NaVi 2-0 sweep. Which is becoming a pattern between these two, dating back to fall '15. However, LG has been a bit of a revelation in recent months, and have surely been improving with each event. Despite losing at DH, the Brazilians forced OT on both maps, in a very tightly fought affair, so they've certainly proven to be a serious threat and one the T1 should watch out for. As for this contest, we're talking about quite a balanced showdown. Betting Odds are still rather balanced as well, giving the small favor to the CIS side. On our end, we're inclined to agree, largely due to the fact they'll already be warmed up for this match, carrying with them either momentum or vengeance. So we're slightly more oriented towards going with Low Bet on Natus Vincere as our pick, but wouldn't be surprised if OT was again required.

Fnatic has continued their reign at the top for some time now, with only a brief interruption in recent memory. This is always a pretty interesting matchup when these two meet. The Swedes have surely had to sweat through most of victories over the Brazilians, so we wouldn't be surprised to see Luminosity make this a another very difficult match for the 'Team to Beat'. The two most recently met in Minsk for the Quarter-Final of the StarSeries Finals. After sweeping FaZe and Natus Vincere, LG moment of glory was tested by Swedes. After splitting the first two maps, Coldzera and company were poised to keep the run going with 9-6 lead at half on Inferno. But a furious comeback lead by an all-start performance from Flusha, saw the LG dream slip away. Overall, these two tend to put on a great show, and one we're looking forward to. Currently, the Betting Odds are rolling in favor of the Swedes, but this doesn't properly reflect the matchup. On our end, we kinda following a similar pattern as several matches already. With these percentages, we're still good for Low Bet on Fnatic, but if they pass the 80/20 threshold, we're certainly ok with risking a ICB on a Brazilian upset.

Mousesports are rolling into this game after playing the event-opening match against NiP (surely not an easy one), and a game we suppose to be an easy walk versus TheMongolz. In the short-term, Mouz played kinda above our expectations, winning APM Finals, qualifying for MLG Columbus and streaking a good series of shows in the weekly EPL games. So we're talking about a team that should be considered as a real threat in these BO1s. On the other hand, Natus Vincere are one of the lineups that started 2016 in the best way, and actually they're sporting a form comparable to the Fnatic one, even if they always ended sweating more than necessary when dealing with T2 opponents in BO1 matches. Betting odds are trending in favor of NAVI, and this is correct since they should move here already well warmed up and firing from all cylinders, but we're still prone in considering Mouz a bad client, in particular on maps such as Mirage and Overpass. So we're oriented in taking advantage of the quite sweet percentages, by attempting a Low pick on Mousesports.

This will be the first meeting of the year for the two. We all enjoyed the shows they put on at Champion of Champions, and then again more recently in December for the FB Masters. There we saw the similar pattern from Fnatic, where their best was saved for last. NiP setup some exceptional things in the UB Final, nearly sweeping their local countrymen, but settled for 2-1 finish. So when they met again in the Grand-Final, hopes were high for F0rest and friends rto retake the throne. But as we've seen quite frequently, Olofmeister and co. had some tricks up their sleeves, and they again proved why they're the best in the world. As for this BO1, we're expectimg a pretty balanced match. This will be the second match in a row, and third match of the day for both, so they're both in the heart of their days, and should be in good form for this bout. The Betting Odds are already rolling in favor of Fnatic. Though this is surely closer to even with RW Odds around 55/45. On our end, we're prone to give them an edge, but so while percentages are still rewarding for a Low Bet on Fnatic, they're our pick. However, we recommend waiting closer to the game start, to see how both play their earlier games as well as the percentages, and evaluate a possible ICB on NiP.
http://csgo.guru/match/4006!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8440!$NiP!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.48!$0.39!$0.08999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$A big classic and also one of the greatest top-tier games we'll enjoy in this first day in Katowice. NiP are stepping here after a couple of tricky matches against Fnatic and Mouz, and according to the kinda few contests they played during this first part of the year we don't really know what to expect from the Swedes. In particular if we'll watch de_train or de_inferno, a couple of maps where lately F0rest and the gang experienced serious issues in playing against NAVI. On the other hand Natus Vincere had to deal with an even heavier batch of matches prior reaching the current one. After messing with Fnatic, Luminosity and Mousesports, there are good chances to watch the CIS-side start feeling some fatigue and pressure, while the Swedes should be a bit fresher. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, so we're siding for a Low pick on Natus Vincere, even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch Guardian and co. slowing their run a bit compared to their previous matches.
http://csgo.guru/match/4007!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8442!$mouz!$LG!$LG!$0.45!$0.26!$0.19!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Kinda tricky match to predict since these sides met only once several months ago, and in particular prior the LG boom. However, both rosters are moving here after a pretty good streak of consistent performances, and we already widely discussed about them early today. So here we'll just add that the Luminosity way to play stepped up a lot from their previous encounter, and proven to be a real threat for unprepared EU teams as well. In particular here where we're talking about a game happening pretty late in the DAY 1 schedule, the Brazilian playstyle could be the spark that may trigger the difference, and provide them an advantage over the generally conservative executions delivered by Mousesports. Betting odds are still quite decent for a Low pick on Luminosity, so we're oriented in taking this path, even if we're surely talking about a game that can easily go either way according to momentum.

This will be the fifth match of the day for both squads, and due to schedule of games one after the next, we can't infer from the performances in those games here now. Not currently the most balanced of games, but a matchup that has historically gone both ways. Theres no arguing the form of Fnatic coming into this event, riding an impressive early year winning streak. It wasn't that long ago we wondered how the addition of Dennis would affect the Swedes success. We can confidently look back say it didn't impede their capabilities. And from what they've shown so far this year, they've a fruitful 2016 ahead of them. Mousesports on the other hand, as we mentioned earlier, already found LAN success at APM Finals. However, the level of competition was a step below those represented in Poland this week. Their Leipzig trip was much more difficult for the Germans, and likely more aligned to the results they'll find here. Coming into Katowice, they had a few troublesome online games, but in Columbus for the Main Qualifier, NiKo and friends defeated HellRaisers in OT to claim a spot for the upcoming Major. So online games aside, they're surely have a little extra boost of confidence. And for the Swedes, they'll need any advantage they can get. The Betting Odds are already trashed in favor of the Swedish side. Though we dont agree with such lopsided percentages, we doubt they'll fail to dismiss Mouz, so we're oriented towards a skip for the game. However, how the results unfold prior to this match may give reason to consider an ICB on the German-side. If the Swedes really have nothing to lose by the 5th game, as far as group seeding goes, than we may see more of a casual effort, warranting such an ICB consideration. Otherwise, Fnatic is our pick, if we have to pick a side.

This might also quite possibly be a contest with a Quarter-Final seed on the line, which surely makes this that much more interesting. On paper, Luminosity vs NiP is mostly a pure 50/50 matchup, featuring two teams sporting unique playstyles. We mentioned earlier this was the first LAN appearance from NiP, but any rust they may have developed will certainly be tested by the time this dual begins. In the limited games the Swedes have played this year, they've played better than expected, after such an extended break of competition. Their most recent LAN showing at FBM S5 Finals was mostly successful. Just prior to that, NiP faced the Brazilians in the Faceit Finals, where LG managed to eliminate the Swedes in impressive fashion. A contest they'd surely like some payback for. Luminosity on the other hand, have also looked very promising recently. They've been quite effective online, but have also continued to push their way to the top offline. They made a serious case for their position amongst the Top tier, with moderately deep runs on LAN for a trophy. As for this contest, we're gonna have to infer a bit on early matches of the as well as the stake by the time of this match. Betting odds are actually quite balanced, awarding a small edge to the Brazilians. On our end, we're inclined to agree, and feel LG is inevitably on the verge of taking a Major. But considering this to as balanced as it is, we're oriented towards playing the percentages whichever way is more rewarding. So at the moment, our pick NiP for the higher reward, but we recommend waiting a bit see how the numbers move.

Both teams met already just a few days ago in the Pantamera Challenge, and looked pretty much aligned in their performances (ATN won 16-13). ALTERNATE aTTaX started their Pantamera weekend 'pedal to the metal', and after the first day they were favored to reach the Grand-Final, however things didn't quite go that way. As soon as the event moved to the BO3 format, the Germans began struggling, and aside from losing in a brutal way in their Semi-Final against Ancient (they managed to grab only 8 rounds across two maps). They then proceeded to fall short versus Preparation in the 3rd place decider. On the other hand, the adventures of Torpedo ended even earlier, since the Swedish mix failed to reach playoffs, despite delivering rather acceptable shows during the BO1 phase. Surely we were expecting them to perform a bit better, based on their recent promising online results. However, talking about the current match, we're expecting to watch de_cbble, de_mirage and de_overpass as maps. If the veto will go this way, Cobblestone should be in slightly favor of ATN, while both Mirage and Overpass are gonna be kind of question marks. Betting odds are still quite even, so at our end we're oriented in going with a Low pick on ALTERNATE aTTaX, with the hope of watching them a bit more consistent compared to their latest BO3 shows.

CLG came in to the week following an inconsistent showing in Columbus for the MLG qualifier. There the North Americans began the event a bit shaky in a surprising loss to SPLYCE, but after following that up with a couple of stronger performances earning victories over SK and Vexed, CLG managed to claim their spot at the upcoming Major in April. Considering their generally below average success rate in the past few months, this response was surely encouraging. Meanwhile, NRG has been a bit of a surprise since their inception at the beginning of the year. The EU/NA mix that rose from the ashes of the former Method squad, have surely proven to be a legitimate contender in a rather crowded group of solid Tier 3 teams. And they'll be coming into the week following a couple of decent shows, including a 2-1 win over WinterFox and splitting a pair of EPL matches with Liquid. So we're certainly expecting them to give CLG some difficulties. As for this contest, we believe theres good chances we'll watch de_dust2, de_mirage, and de_train. Provided the Veto goes this direction, CLG should be advantaged on Dust2 and Train, while NRG should be able to take Mirage. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of CLG, which is correct. However, we should keep in mind, CLG hasn't been as efficient online, as their better performance on LAN this year. So on our end, we're slightly more oriented towards trying our Luck on Low Bet on NRG for the more profitable reward.

E-Frag have been playing decently in the short-term, but much of their schedule has been a good step below most of the teams on LAN this week. However the Bulgarians are certainly better performers offline, and feel right at home with communication aspects of it. But its worth adding, they'll be playing with pNshr in place of Dream3r, which likely won't improve their chances here, so we're not really expecting them to disrupt the expected seating by day's end. FaZe on the other hand, have surely been a much more solid team since the organization change. And have generally excelled with mostly good results when there are BO1s in play. As for a deep run here, they'll likely have some problems, but for the group stage they surely pose a threat. As for this entry game, Maikelele and friends are surely the advantaged, while betting Odds are rolling in their favor. As long as they stay rewarding, FaZe is our pick for Low+ Bet. But keep the values, with cautious to the BO1 randomness.

This is also a classic matchup of recent CS:GO history, featuring two of the top contenders behind the Swedes. EnVyUs have been amongst the busier teams this year, having already grabbed the GameShow Cup, and hit a decent run in StarSeries Finals. However, coming into this event, the Frenchmen are at a critical moment, where in the short term they been experiencing difficulties in Tier-1 games. So getting tested in the entry game could greatly impact their path through Katowice. However, they have proven to be always get their game up a notch more often than not when the stakes are important. Astralis, on the other hand, have overall been in pretty good shape. With the exception of Fnatic, the Danes have been managing victories over almost every other team out there. Even when they've gotten in trouble, they've had Device to help lead them out. Betting odds are trending in favor of EnVyus, but this is a pretty much a pure 50/50 matchup. So we're slightly inclined to play the percentages for higher reward, so our pick is a Low Bet on Astralis.

Theres not too much to say about this mid-tiered matchup and we already spoke to the current level of the Bulgarians in their opening contest. This is likely the most balanced matchup they'll draw for the second day in Katowice, considering the level of opponents Brazilians face on a regular basis. However, the deeper into the year we've got, the more challenging the contests have been for Tempo Storm. Most recently was their (disappointing) appearance in Columbus for the Major Qualifier. We've expressed countless times our excitement over this second Pro Brazilian bunch, and although they failed to grab one the spots for the Major, they did manage to setup some really good things in the short-term. So we're watching closely to see if they'll upset the expected order of things in Poland. This will be the first meeting of these two, and we surely feel the Brazil-side are currently sporting stronger form right now. So although, theres good chances of watching a tight match, we're oriented towards going with a Low Bet on Tempo Storm to start the day on a high note.

Virtus.Pro has been arguably the most difficult team review this year. Historically, we've alway looked to the Poles as one of the landmark Tier-1 teams, but not quite reaching the consistency needed take out elite in high stakes situations with any regularity. They had a horrific start to their year, after nearly a month and half long break. In their first month of competition, VP puzzled the scene with a rather stunning losing streak in various T2-T1 matches. The only glimpse of hope they've shown was a very tightly contest back-to-back with EnVyUs, where each team grabbed a map. This was the first time in the last Quarter where Pasha and friends put up a performance aligned to the Top Tier.And this really the reason we still have reserved optimism for a Polish return to form. Particularly here, where home turf could be the boost they need to get back on track. Historically, these two haven't always put on a best shows, since the Danes have typically managed to handle the Polish-side in easy fashion. But moving offline, things always get a little trickier. Betting Odds are skewed in favor of the Danish, which is correct. And although VP sport the firepower to upset this pattern, we've our doubts over what to expect from them, since they've been quite unreliable in the short term. So we're moreso oriented towards skipping this game, and just watch which VP shows up to play. But if we must pick a side, Astralis is surely the most reliable pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/4064!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8466!$VP!$EnVyUs!$VP!$0.55!$0.25!$0.30000000000000004!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We're in the thick of things here for the Group B GroupStage, and we're entering the third round of matches. While EnVyUs will get a small break between their first game and this one, Virtus.Pro will be coming directly into it following their entry game with Astralis, which will surely offer us insights regrdaing the current form of Poles, we're not prevy to at this moment. We were previewed this classic matchup online last week for EPL Week 3. As mentioned in their entry game, those two ESL games have surely made this contest substantially more interesting, than the Poles remaining body of work for the year. There's no debating VP had fallen on hard times to start the new year. Leaving a trail of strat-less losses along the way against the top and mid tiers. Granted, our expectations from the Poles at the start of the year were lower than normal, due to their extended absence from pro competition, through and after the holiday break. But 3-4 weeks into their schedule, the turnaround everyone felt was inevitably going to arrive, never came. Except for their meeting with the Frenchmen. On the other end of the pendulum, while VP was on break, EnVyUs competing relentless, and remain one of the top contenders for the crown. However, as we noted in their first match, the French have recently began experiencing issues with high-end opponents. And expect their entry game with the Danes will offer valuable insight, as to whether the move offline is the exactly 'what the doctor ordered' to nudge NV back to the winning track. As for this match, we still have serious concerns over what VP will offer. But since the Frenchmen tend perform at their best on LAN, we agree with the Betting Odds favoring them as well. So here we're gonna wait to see the percentages near match time. Our pick is a Low Bet on EnVyUs to make the push for that lone semi-final spot. But if we pass 75/25, we'll throw a ICB on on the Polish side in hopes of getting a substantial return.
http://csgo.guru/match/4065!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8467!$FaZe!$TStorm!$FaZe!$0.52!$0.8!$-0.28!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Here is where things get really interesting, considering theres good chances we're looking at a matchup contest those final spot in the Quarter-Finals. FaZe is another team we haven't seen a whole lot this year. During which time they've had a mixed bag of results. A portion of the games have been with high-end teams, so honestly their results have been mostly as expected. But on the whole, their performances have been pretty much aligned within the T2, as a solid mid-tier team. Despite the limited schedule, this will be the third offline appearance from the Europeans, where they'll surely be striving for more encouraging results, than what they failed to achieve at DH Leipzig, and StarSeries Finals. Meanwhile, this will be the second relevant LAN tournament for current Tempo Storm roster. Despite an optimistic online run leading up to the MLG Qualifier, the Brazilians didn't quite get to their game, and failed to qualify for the Major. We'll surely attribute some of that to this to nerves, but also their losses came to higher ranked opponents. Overall we were encouraged by much of what they managed in Columbus, but the decider match loss to F3 rose some concern to their approach and planning for matchups. So we're interested to see what they learned from last weekends experience. As for this match, we're looking at quite a balanced mid-tier matchup. As mentioned previously, the Brazilians sport a very similar playstyle as fellow countrymen Luminosity, which much of the EU have difficulties countering. And as we've seen FaZe struggle with LG earlier this year, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them stumble some with this Brazilian bunch as well. So on our end, we're putting a little faith in Tempo Storm for a Low Bet.
http://csgo.guru/match/4066!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8469!$E-Frag!$Astralis!$Astralis!$0.35!$0.09!$0.26!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Third match of the for both teams, and things should surely be starting take shape at this point. Now we've just another mix-tiered contest, but one we're not really expecting any surprises from. E-frag has had some peaks in the short term offering signs of being able to throw a wrench in the expected order of Group B. However, the Bulgarians are playing without dream3r, who is surely one of their stronger performers, instead playing with pNshr, whose a good step down for the lineup. So their chances to upset here are even slighter. Meanwhile, Astralis are a solid and consistent Tier-1, whose only recent struggles, have been at the handds of the reigning Swedes. And unlike some of the other T1 teams, the Danes haven't really been prone to random fails with lower ranked teams. So regardless of how the Veto goes, the Danish are advantaged across the map-pool. So we don't expect they'll have much issue in quickly dismissing Efrag. Betting Odds are pretty much trash already for a Danish victory. We're in total agreement on our end, especially since chances are the Dane's could have ground to make up to retain the event advancement. So Astralis is the side we'll pick, or eventually skip if the percentages aren't too profitable.

By this point of the day, we'll have a clearer idea of how EnVyUs responded to adversity they've recently encountered. But these troubles have predominantly been with the Swedes and the Danes, otherwise the Frenchmen are one of the most consistent teams out there. On paper, a match they shouldn't have too much trouble managing. On the other hand, we honestly haven't seen too much Faze since moving from G2. In the 3rd and and early 4th Quarter of '15, they trended to achieve moments of brillancy by way of some stunning upsets. The end of 2015 wasn't quite the high, and they haven't really managed to surprise the top-tier teams since. But since the move and the fresh start, they seem to be gradually improving in some areas, which is surely promising. So as we see more of the Europeans, the less we'll be surprised to see them setting up some good things against KennyS and the gang. Betting Odds are trending in favor of EnVyUs, a path we do agree. But we still find EnVyUs more reliable here, so they're our pick for a Low Bet. But midway trough the day, we'd surely try an ICB on FaZe is the percentages reach 85/15.
http://csgo.guru/match/4068!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8470!$TStorm!$VP!$TStorm!$0.42!$0.3!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Third match in a row for both teams, and early today we already widely discussed about the terrible performances that Virtus.Pro managed to deliver during the past two months. And we also pointed out several times how Tempo Storm improved over-time, and have gone from being just a minor team within the NA scene, into leading the pack. However, talking about the current match, as we mentioned above, the current status of VP is kinda of depressing. Actually the Poles are looking more like a wounded great beast. So its mostly a matter to guess if we'll watch them using their claws or not. Surely they are moving here already well warmed up, and if they manage to avoid slow maps such as Cobblestone, we believe that they may have good chances for taking home a victory, taking advantage of their superior experience. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on Virtus.Pro, so we're oriented in taking this path, even if overall we might enjoy a pretty close contest.
http://csgo.guru/match/4069!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8471!$FaZe!$Astralis!$Astralis!$0.44!$0.29!$0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not the obvious match as it may look at first sight. Astralis are surely one of the best candidates for going through to the playoffs, but this game may turn into a pretty tricky contest, particularly if FaZe can manage to move here with a couple of victories in the bag from the previous matches. FaZe are generally an extremely momentum-based team, and then if they'll manage to boost their confidence with good results in their entry games, we might watch them exploit the BO1 format to get some victories that generally aren't always in their cards when dealing with T1 opponents. So Maikelele and friends need to pray for a neutral map, such as Inferno, in this case we'll watch a quite balanced game, and maybe an OT as well. Betting odds are trending in favor of Astralis, and this is ok since they are one of the hottest teams in this Group, but honestly we find some upset potential in FaZe, so at our end we're more prone in attempting a Low- pick on them, aiming for the higher reward.
http://csgo.guru/match/4070!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8472!$VP!$E-Frag!$VP!$0.6!$0.81!$-0.21000000000000008!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Honestly we aren't really expecting huge surprises out of this game. Surely Virtus.Pro cruised through some pretty troubled waters for several months, and achieved a kinda terrible streak of sub-par results. But overall their level is still way above that of E-Frag, so TaZ and friends should be able to deal with the Bulgarians without sweating too much. On the other hand, E-Frag are without a doubt the team sporting the lesser chances to move through the Group Stage, but in the mid-term they have showed some consistency and decent organization, so despite their lack of fire-power compared to the big names floating around at this event, they should be able to deliver a few acceptable shows in most of their contests. Here we might watch a slightly closer game if we see Dust2 as map, but overall we don't believe this will happen. So we're oriented in going for a Low+ pick on Virtus.Pro.
http://csgo.guru/match/4071!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8473!$EnVyUs!$TStorm!$TStorm!$0.58!$0.75!$-0.17000000000000004!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Not much to say, aside that EnVyUs are surely stepping into this match as clearly favored. However, as you probably already figured out, the current betting odds are already way too trashed in favor of the French side. And even if KennyS and friends certainly have a good advantage, we don't believe that Tempo Storm really deserve percentages floating around 15%. Especially when considering the good things they managed to setup over the short-term (even if the Major Qualifier didn't exactly go as they expected). However, as usual when we talk about values floating around 85/15 and promising teams such as Tempo Storm, we're oriented in gambling with odds, so our pick is an ICB on Tempo Storm. But if you can't afford an ICB, just skip and move on, there are still good matches to come on the Katowice schedule.
http://csgo.guru/match/4072!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8474!$TStorm!$Astralis!$Astralis!$0.4!$0.3!$0.10000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$While we're oriented in giving some respectable chances to Tempo Storm in the previous game against EnVyUs, even if just for a tiny ICB, we're not quite as oriented in doing the same thing here versus Astralis. Surely the Brazilians sport quite a good upset potential, due to their very quick style of play, but while (with some luck) they may find some holes in the French armor, we don't really believe they'll be able to exploit the Danes in the same way. Particularly since the Danes are generally less prone to choking in mid-tier contests. Additionally they're also kinda oriented toward offering a solid defensive gameplay on most of the maps. However, Betting odds are again pretty skewed, but at least here we find the risk-factor slightly lower than the Envy game, so we're prone in going for a Low+/Avg- pick on Astralis, since we find them pretty reliable.
http://csgo.guru/match/4073!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8475!$FaZe!$VP!$VP!$0.48!$0.56!$-0.08000000000000007!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Much likely a fairly crucial match, since both teams will probably land here sharing almost the same chances to grab a spot for the playoffs. As we stated in the previous Virtus.Pro matches as well, guessing what the Poles will put up is a quite difficult task, when considering the widely inconsistent performances they've setup in the the past Quarter. However, they generally wake up a little in relevant matches. Additionally, having several matches played in a row could help them in regaining their LAN form a bit, something the Polish seriously need. On the other hand, FaZe have an extremely long history of matches where they rolled over the Polish side, and overall they've always seemed quite able to properly counter what TaZ and co. managed to deliver. So we're pretty sure we'll watch a pretty tight contest. At our end we believe we'll watch Train or Mirage as map. In the first case Maikelele and co. may have an edge, but on Mirage things may trend in favor of the Polish side. Betting odds are still sitting around 50/50, but based on what VP displayed over the past weeks we're more oriented in going Low on FaZe.
http://csgo.guru/match/4074!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8476!$EnVyUs!$E-Frag!$E-Frag!$0.7!$0.84!$-0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just like the previous games for E-Frag against top-end opponents we reviewed early-today, we don't really believe we'll watch something out of the ordinary in this contest. EnVyUs should be able to hit this game with a playoffs spot nearly sealed, so their performance here will be mostly related to how important this game will be for them. If they need it for qualification purposes, they should be able to take it home without facing any huge issues, but if they end here with their top-seed already in the bag, we won't expect to watch the Frenchmen spoiling their strats for just the glory. So the advice we can provide about this matchup is to wait till the previous batch of contests, and then evaluate to determine whether or not to bet (on EnVyUs) according to the points they've acquired so far. However, betting odds are already kinda trash, so just skip, wait and see .
http://csgo.guru/match/4075!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8454!$CSGL!$FSid3!$FSid3!$0.55!$0.34!$0.21000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$This CounterPit BO2 is the only EU match available beside the games from IEM Katowice, currently live from Poland. Overall we don't have any huge expectations from this contest, and as usual when we talk about mid/low-end BO2s, there are pretty good chances of watching just a Tie. CSGL are stepping here following quite a good streak. Not something usual for the Polish side, who spent most of the past 6 months struggling against most of the mid-tier rosters around. However it seems that after the switch between Oskarish and Szpero, things actually improved a bit for the Poles. Surely the Tie against E-frag, and the victories over Penta and Gambit are promising results. On the other hand FlipSid3 are doing quite fine as well, and compared to CSGL, they're also a good step ahead on the extended map-pool. So honestly, we doubt we'll watch Markeloff and co. losing more than a map. So going with them should be kind of a reliable option. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on FlipSid3, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/4083!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8480!$Liquid!$coL!$Liquid!$0.58!$0.77!$-0.19000000000000006!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Aside from another day packed with the Katowice Group Stage, we've a couple of CEVO matches too, and here a pretty good NA contest. Liquid are fresh off qualifying for the MLG Columbus Major next month, where we saw Hiko mostly single-handed put up one of his performances this year in a 2-1 victory over HellRaisers. And just prior to that, they grabbed their spot in DH Masters Malmo. As we saw in their trip to Columbus, we're surely seeing them regain their form, and their position in the NA Tier-1. On the other hand we've CompLexity, who've provided slightly better showings than we expected following the NA shuffle. However, despite the higher compete level, they've yet to really close out in these mostly mid-tiered matches. But it's worth noting cause they've surely made their ranked opponents sweat for these wins. But staying competitive in most of these contests is quite encouraging, and we wouldn't be surprised to see a match much closer than expected. As for this contest, since coL managed to split the maps with Liquid in the first EPL meeting, they've got a some reference strat-wise going into this match. And regarding the maps for this BO3, there are good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_dust2, and de_mirage. If the Veto follows this pattern, coL will have an edge on Cache, while Liquid will be favored on Dust2 and Mirage. Betting Odds are already trashed in Liquid's favor, which we have to agree on, based on what they've managed in the past few weeks. As usual, when we're looking 85/15 percentages, we're oriented toward skipping. Although we expect coL can grab a map, we highly doubt Liquid will lose twice here, so they're our pick if we have to pick a side.
http://csgo.guru/match/4084!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8483!$Na'Vi!$TStorm!$Na'Vi!$0.56!$0.74!$-0.17999999999999994!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$After a couple of days packed with some amazing matches, IEM Katowice is finally moving forward to the Quarter-Finals. The Quarters here feature just two matchups, while both LG and Astralis have already advanced to Semis thanks to finishing 1st place in their respective Groups. However, talking about the current match, this is surely an extremely interesting contest. Tempo Storm arrived here after delivering some top-notch shows yesterday, managing to advance through despite being in a Group featuring powerhouses such as EnVyUs and FaZe (both of whom failed to qualify). So surely the Brazilians started the event the right way, highlighted by some effectively aggressive T-Sides particular in their showdown with NV. Proven to be a legitimte threat, they should be fully capable of creating some troubles for GuardiaN and friends as well. On the other hand Natus Vincere rolled into this event as one of the favorites, but instead the Ukrainians ended up struggling in their first matches. After two losses, they finally managed to wake-up and achieve the 3 necessary victories in order to move through to day three. About maps, here we're expecting to watch de_dust2, de_inferno and de_train. If the veto takes this path, NaVi should have a clear edge on Train and should be decent on Inferno as well, while we wouldn't be surprised to watch Tempo taking Dust2. Betting odds are currently a bit skewed in favor of the CIS-side, but overall still decent for a Low+ pic on Natus Vincere, so we're oriented in taking this way, since we find them a bit more reliable on the extended map-pool. But the Brazilians have played spoiler so far, making this contest riskier than appears at first glance, so use caution with the values.
http://csgo.guru/match/4085!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8482!$Fnatic!$VP!$Fnatic!$0.58!$0.81!$-0.2300000000000001!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$A big classic and always a great match to watch. Fnatic are heading into this contest after failing to grab the top-spot in Group-A, which was surely something a bit unexpected based on what they've achieved in the short-term. However, they did sweat their way past Mouz in OT to at least reach the Quarter-Final, but despite the additional match they are about to play, they remain one of the big favorites for winning the whole event (even if both Astralis and Luminosity are looking quite on point). On the other hand, Virtus.Pro ended up here mainly by taking advantage of the failures of both EnVyUs and FaZe. But overall, we've to say that they're at least looking way better compared to their latest disappointing online matches. Surely the home-soil factor will play a role today on the main stage, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing better than expected. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_train, de_cache and de_dust2. If we guessed them correctly, Dust2 should be in favor of Fnatic, while VP may grab Cache, and Dust2 is going to be kinda 50/50 since both sides never really excelled on it. Betting odds are currently insanely skewed in favor of the Swedes, and while they surely have an advantage, we should always remember that we're talking about a Tier-1 matchup in one of the most relevant events of the year, so real-world odds are way more aligned. Considering these absurd current percentages, we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB on Virtus.Pro. Without a doubt the smartest thing to do with the current 80/20 odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/4086!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8486!$Selfless!$NRG!$Selfless!$0.52!$0.27!$0.25!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Turns out we've a second match on the NA schedule tonight, as we move in to the Cevo S9 playoffs, and here we've our first Semi-Final out of the NA Bracket. Enemy, whose been playing as 'Selfless', has been stuck with an inconsistent set of circumstances since Koosta departed to join Liquid. But since, hes still had to play with NME in previous qualified leagues, so getting used to Nifty as the fifth man, has been practically impossible. Especially since they sporadic needed for an additional stand-in. Beyond that, they just failed to qualify offline for the Columbus Major in an overall disappointing trip. But last night they made to beat TSM in the Quarter-Final, landing them here in this contest. Meanwhile, NRG has been quite a challenge for the NA scene to deal with, earning their appearance here following quite a strong 2-1 effort to bump CLG from the bracket. And overall, the EU/NA mix pairs well with much of the map-pool, giving them a little more versatility against the higher teams. Since the lineups' inception, they've only faced NME once for a 2map EPL contest where there managed to grab at least a map. So we've slightly more confidence in their stability at the moment. For this BO3 set, following the Veto we expect we might watch de_mirage, de_inferno, and de_cache. Should we see this selection, NRG will actually be favored on Mirage, while NME will take the edge on Inferno, leaving Cache which could go either way. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of NRG, which makes sense, particularly with the roster questions for Selfless. Percentages are still rewarding for Low+Bet on NRG, so we're oriented toward taking that path.
http://csgo.guru/match/4164!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8484!$LG!$Na'Vi!$LG!$0.48!$0.63!$-0.15000000000000002!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Incredibly fascinating matchup awaiting us here in the first Semi-Final of IEM Katowice 2016, featuring two of the top teams in the World out of the EU and NA scenes. Coming into the event, we knew Group-A held some surprises, considering the dynamic mix of elite talent within. Amongst this mix Luminosity have been top NA representative to have gradually forced their way into the top the pack, and over the past quarter+, they've developed a high level consistency needed to go deep in these championship tournaments. Being grouped with teams such as Natus Vincere and Fnatic (arguably 'the' two best in the world) and even NiP, the Brazilians weren't quite expected to take the top seed, or even reach the Quarters for that matter. However, FalleN and the gang, had no doubts of their own, going 4-1 through the Group Stage to grab the lone Semi-Final spot. Mostly impressively, they managed to grab consecutive wins over NAVI and Fnatic, and again look to be in full form for the trophy run. Meanwhile, Natus Vincere already grabbed two trophies this year, as favorites in these events dating back to last Summer. Although they managed to arrive in this Semi, the road here has surely been less convincing than Brazilian side. Mid way through group stage, they were on the outside looking in. But took advantage of their superiority, winning the final 3 maps their spot. Before the semis, they drew Tempo Storm in the Qtrs. The Brazilian group, kinda the little brother to LG, sporting extremely similar playstyles and practice routines. Despite the obvious advantage GuardiaN and friends held over Tempo Storm, many of the mistakes we saw from NaVi on Day 1, continued today, and had to climb back from a 13-8 3rd map deficit after seemingly having full control after Overpass. So currently we've serious concerns about the CIS-side against LG. We're not alone with these concerns, as current Betting Odds are trending in favor of LG. Percentages we really haven't seen before with NaVi on the other side. But we need to remember, much like the Swedes, NAVI tends to look a bit reserved in the early stages, but typically bring out the best as the stakes are raised. And here we also have a bit of history between these two at this level, so 3 maps and possible OT would't be at all surprising. Regarding the Maps, there's good chances we'll watch: de_mirage, de_train, and de_inferno. Provided we see these maps come out of the Veto, LG should be slightly favored on Train, NaVi advantaged on Inferno, leaving Mirage which could easily go either way. So we're pretty much looking at a pure 50/50 matchup, with RW Odds slightly edged in favor of NAVI, largely due to the success on the grand stage. On our end, we're wondering if this is finally the one LG can top. And at this point, there form looks to be the more solid of two, especially after watching what TStorm managed vs NAVI already today. So we're going to follow the trend and go with a Low Bet on Luminosity, in hopes of seeing them reach the Grand Final.

The Swedes are moving into this game after a somewhat unexpected short fight against Virtus.Pro. For this Quarter we were honestly hoping to watch some better things from the Poles, particularly playing on home-soil. Plus they also previously managed to deliver decent things during the Group-Stage. But apparently, Fnatic were a bit too much for the still kinda shaky form of the Polish side. However, despite a slow start, JW and gang are still one of the huge favorites to take home the trophy, and their stunning victory over VP sent a clear message to the rest of the teams remaining in the tournament. On the other hand, Astralis delivered a pretty great show during Group-Stage. They topped their Group to move to the Playoffs as the first seed, gaining a free pass for the Semi-Finals. Overall, despite their good performance in the BO1s, we still have some question marks about their form on the extended map-pool. In particular now that they have to face one of the hottest teams around, notoriously deadly in BO3s, and whose dominated them over recent weeks. However, unlike VP, surely the Danes have the firepower and the form for taking the game to the third map, so we're expecting a kinda close matchup. About maps, we'll likely watch de_dust2, de_inferno and de_mirage. If we nailed the veto, Dust2 may go to Astralis, while Fnatic will likely grab Inferno, leaving Mirage which is going to be kinda balanced. Betting odds are already pretty skewed in favor of the Swedes, and this is correct since Fnatic without a doubt sport a favorable edge. But at our end, we cannot really agree on percentages floating around 70/30 for a Semi-Final of a Major event such as Katowice. So despite their recent H2Hs, we're slightly more prone towards gambling with the odds and going for an ICB/Low on Astralis.

The final chapter of this Polish journey features the old King Fnatic matched up with LG, the rising Brazilians to arrive in this contest after 6 months of progressive improvements, that turned them from being an average NA team to one of the strongest and most respected sides of the International scene. Talking about this matchup, Luminosity started Katowice, pedal to the metal, ending the Group-Stage as first seed and in a mostly flawless fashion. Then yesterday, they raised the bar even higher by beating Natus Vincere with an impressive 2-0 sweep. Honestly we were expecting a little more from GuardiaN and friends, particularly since they joined this event as one of the favored teams. But well, here the Brazilians delivered quite a good veto, and handled the Ukrainians quite smartly on de_inferno, preventing them from hitting the third map. On the other hand, Fnatic experienced a slightly more bumpy road to the top. They finished their Group in 2nd place, which forced them to face Virtus.Pro in the Quarter-Final. But unfortunately we can't really say that the Poles offered any solid resistance. Basically they just lost a good opportunity to bounce back after several months of struggles. However, the following Semi-Final, against Astralis turned into a pretty intense battle, where the Danes, as we were expecting, joined the game motivated enough to take home a victory. They were even on the verge of achieving it, but after taking the contest to the third map, they dropped the ball and the series. About maps, since we're talking about a BO5, so we'll basically enjoy most of them. And generally, this is a condition that puts Fnatic in a slightly more advantaged position, due to their extended experience on most of the maps. Generally we can say that we find Fnatic advantaged on Cache and Train, while LG may grab de_mirage, leaving de_dust2 and de_inferno as pretty balanced grounds. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of the Swedes, and we're prone to give them a tiny edge as well, because of the BO5 format. However we're talking about two teams who overall offered extremely solid performances this week, so the percentages to see FalleN and the gang doing well are pretty good too. At our end we're prone toward endorsing the Brazilian 'Cindarella story' by going for a Low pick on them.

In the first round of single elimination bracket for the Binary Dragons Cup, we've a Russian derby between a couple of teams we've seen mix it up with some of the more relevant teams of recent events. Method versus YP could take on more of a pug-like contest, which can certainly offer its moments of entertainment. And although, neither can deliver much against the pro ranked teams (yet), but at head to head level within these local/international matches we are looking at a mostly pure 50/50 contest. This Method lineup is the young bunch who filled the roster after the former lineup parted ways from the org, who we first saw participate in the GEC. Although they were no match for Astralis, they Russians did so some promise when matched up with C9, who they forced to actually sweat their way to the win. Considering the org's efforts to keep the logo active within the scene, we'll likely being seeing more from them in the future. So on a slow day, such as today, we'll throw them a little spot-light as they show some promise to push their the front of the unranked pack. YP on the other hand, we recently saw in Columbus for the Major Qualifier. However, their path to relevance may be a longer one, considering the lack of pushback they offered there. Additionally, they're fielding stand-ins today, so we're not expecting too much progress in their development on this stage. As mentioned, this is actually a quite balanced matchup, while the current Betting Odds are trending in favor of YP. But that is likely moreso influenced by their recent MLG appearance. While on our end, we feel the chances are better to see Method take this BO3, so we're oriented toward taking advantage of these percentages for the higher reward and going with a Low Bet on them as well.

For this Semi we have a pretty interesting matchup between Liquid, whose already established a foothold amongst the NA Tier-1, and OpTic whose been making their ascension up the NA ranks as a legitimate threat for the top-tier. Liquid clinched their spot in the Semis following a rather dominant sweep of CompLexity last week, with consecutive 16-4 maps. Following a questionable start to the year and an inactive January, s1mple and friends have surely found their form and consistency, seizing their spots in both DreamHack Malmo and the MLG Columbus Major. During which time they've strung together quite a convincing path of performances, including notable wins over CLG and HellRaisers. Now they look to add another date to their schedule, with the Gfinity LAN Finals up for grabs. OpTic on the other hand, entered the new year with their new org (previously Conquest) and high expectations, following a strong 4th Quarter of 2015. However, the Canadians really haven't met any of these expectations while disappointingly failed to qualify for the MLG Major, IEM Katowice, as well as DH Malmo. As a result, the promise they previously showed has clearly leveled and replaced with questions over their ability to shine when the stakes are raised. So we certainly have reservations about how they'll handle the task before them today. As for this match, on paper, Liquid remains a decisive step up from the current form of OC. But historically, we're looking at quite balanced matchup. We've mentioned before how the OpTic's playstyle doesn't fit the traditional mold of the NA teams, which HiKo and company have had repeated troubles in countering. This will actually be their first encounter of the year, and quite a test for OpTic considering the level Liquid is currently playing. As for the Veto, we believe there's good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_overpass, and de_train. Assuming these are the picks, Train will favor OpTic, Overpass will favor liquid, and Cache is most balanced giving a slight edge to Liquid as well. Current Betting Odds are still moving quite a bit, but mostly in heavy favor of Liquid. Although we agree they have the advantage, we don't agree with such lopsided percentages, so if the percentages reach 80/20, we're oriented toward trying our luck on an ICB on OpTic . But while they're still rewarding enough for Low Bet, our pick is Liquid.

Both teams had pretty decent showings in the mid-term, Astralis are still working in order to regain their full form, and even if they put up a good show in Katowice, they still experience some stutters against top-3 opponents that need to be addressed. On the other hand, Mousesports failed to move through Groups in Katowice, but overall managed to display pretty promising things, particularly in their Head to Head against Fnatic, that ended in OT after amazing plays from both sides. This match will take place on de_mirage, a map where lately Astralis improved a lot. But after-all not a bad pick for Mousesports either, since here they've already forced the Danes into an OT during DH Leipzig. However, we find that Dupreeh and the gang had a better progression in the past weeks, and unless betting odds will hit the 80/20 threshold we're oriented in picking a Low+ bet on Astralis.

In the previous game we already talked about the form of both teams, together with their recent results at IEM Katowice. So here we'll just add that de_dust2 is a map where Mousesports always managed to put up excellent performances, and also ended delivering relevant upsets in multiple occasions. So we wouldn't be surprised to watch the Germans doing pretty well. On the other hand Astralis are quite good on it too, but surely this isn't one of their favored picks, so even if they still have an edge over the Germans, we're more oriented in attempting a Low- pick on Mousesports. Mostly in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages, in a match we believe will be quite close.

Both teams are moving here after biting the dust at IEM Katowice, without even managing to move through the Group-Stage. Surely quite a disappointing result for two rosters who are fielding some of the most appreciated players of the International scene. Overall NiP managed to deliver slightly better things compared to FaZe, and aside from their entry game against Mousesports, the following matches were all pretty close, and mostly decided by episodes rather than clear mistakes. Stuff is a bit more complex for FaZe, who after a pretty good start against E-Frag &amp; Tempo Storm ended up collapsing as soon as they started meeting Tier-1 rosters. Something that has happened to them on a regular basis since a while. However, this match is taking place on de_dust2, a map where the Swedes have always delivered kinda mixed performances, and where FaZe hasn't played on regular basis during this first Quarter of the year. Overall we're expecting a kinda balanced match, but based on the recent struggles of FaZe against top-tier teams, we're oriented in attempting a Low pick on NiP, since the betting odds are still decent for taking this path.

While we're expecting a pretty inconsistent match on Dust2, according to how these teams performed in the short-term, we believe we'll watch less surprises in this contest taking place on de_train. Train has always been a pretty good map for the Swedes, and even if they've recently dropped the ball a bit, and other Tier-1 rosters (mostly Fnatic &amp; NaVi) turned into the reference teams for this map, we've to say that NiP are still playing it quite well, and surely above a wide margin of the first Tier. On the other hand, FaZe recently never really delivered exciting shows on Train, and overall they are looking kinda inconsistent. So for this game, we're oriented in giving an edge to NiP. Betting odds are still decent for a Low pick on F0rest and friends, so we'll take this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/4191!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8513!$Renegades!$WinterFox!$Renegades!$0.52!$0.75!$-0.22999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving into the NA portion of today's schedule, and we'll begin with another batch of EPL matches. This matchup features two of the currently more inconsistent teams from the NA scene. We haven't seen too much of Renegades in the early stage of the year. Since releasing Havoc, just after qualifying for a spot at Katowice, the Aussies began February with a couple of decent EPL matchups with ex-Enemy and a kinda surprising sweep of CLG. But they failed to grab a spot in DH Malmo after meeting Liquid in the Quarter Final of the Closed Qualifier, where the Australians were unable to even take even a single map. Despite the varying peaks and valleys, they'll enter this match slightly advantaged, particularly on Dust2 where they've recently shown some improvements. WinterFox on the other hand, has really strayed from level they performed in January. And since that time, has fallen right back in to the rut of inconsistency they never broke free from last year. They'll be coming into this week after being idle nearly two weeks. A downtime that followed their early elimination from CEVO S9 by NRG, in a series that showed the continued struggles Wfx has on Dust2. So they'l gain no benefit from the map, against the Aussies who've been the dominant team in their previous meetings. The current Betting Odds are trending in favor of Renegades, which is correct when considering their recent showings, particularly on D2. On our end, since the percentages remain rewarding for following that path, our pick is Low Bet on Renegades.
http://csgo.guru/match/4192!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8514!$WinterFox!$Renegades!$Renegades!$0.48!$0.23!$0.24999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second map of this low-mid tiered EPL matchup between WinterFox and Renegades, except this time we'll move to de_train. Although looking at this semi-balanced contest as whole, we feel WinterFox should be able to grab at least a map from the Aussies, the maps for this series make their path there that much more difficult. Even moreso than Dust, Wfx have had repeated troubles on Train. And after a string a negative results on it last year, Flowsick and friends have mostly avoided Train in 2016. But on the one occasion there against NRG, they had a decent T-side that gave them the buffer to close out with the rare win on Train. So we're rather curious if this is a trend they can repeat. Renegades on the other hand, have had a mixed bag of results on Train. Most recently, they met Gambit on LAN in Columbus with a Major Qualifier on the line. Surprisingly, the Australians began to unravel after stronger start to the event, ultimately landing them in a decider with C9 who sent them packing. However, the LAN fails are surely symptomatic of the Aussies yet not reflective of their online showings. So we still feel they'll maintain the map advantage here. Currently, the Betting Odds favor the Australian side even more on this second map. A trend we're inclined to agree, so while the percentages stay within the 80/20 mark, we're oriented towards going Low again on Renegades as our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/4193!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8515!$AGG!$Splyce!$Splyce!$0.45!$0.35!$0.10000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Down to the final set of NA EPL matches, for a kinda interesting and somewhat tricky matchup to predict. Aside from a couple of matches two weeks ago, AGG have been having a difficult go of things, and come into the week with a poor stretch of losing contests. Since departing from SKDC, they've yet to push their way into mid-T3 mix. But they showed some signs of promise with thier consecutive 2-0 wins over ex-Enemy &amp; SPLYCE, and since then they've made their opponents work for their games, but just haven't managed to hang on in the later rounds. Meanwhile, SPLYCE continues to be an a bit of an enigma. For the second half of January and most of February, Davey and the gang were pretty much easy wins for the 3rd Tier. But at the last minute, they managed to snag the spot vacated by The Mongolz in Columbus for the Major Qualifier, (after having already failed to qualify for the event at the MLG Americas Minor). But considering the losing streak they were on, expectations of relevance from them absent. And to everyone's surprise, they overcame the odds and were the first NA team to clinch a spot in the Major. Brilliant counters and excellent preparation saw Splyce excel on LAN with wins over CLG and Vexed. But we need to remember, historically, this lineup performs exceptionally better offline than online. So we're not expecting to them perform at the same level here. &lt; /p&gt; With that MLG showing fresh on our minds, current Betting Odds are rolling in favor of Splyce. Considering they surely hold the map advantage on Dust2, we're oriented toward following that path for a Low Bet on SPLYCE.
http://csgo.guru/match/4194!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8516!$Splyce!$AGG!$Splyce!$0.55!$0.5!$0.050000000000000044!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving on to the final match of the day, and the 2nd half of the EPL contest between SPLYCE and AGG. We pretty much already covered the state of the both teams in the previous map. The highlights, SPLYCE had a terrible run of games over the past several weeks, but stunned everyone on LAN in Columbus, beating CLG and Vexed. However, for this contest, we're going to Inferno, a map where Arya and co. have had very poor results. Meanwhile, despite the lack of positive results in the short-term, AGG already proved some advantage over Splyce in their previous meeting. This combined with the fact Splyce hasn't yet achieved the same form online as we recently saw offline make this game a potential upset. Current Betting Odds are mostly aligned in the middle, giving the slight edge to Spyce. On our end however, we feel the Canadians should be able to split the maps by taking Inferno again. So our pick is Low Bet on AGG.

Additionally here we're talking about a BO3, so starting with a map advantage means basically having two match-points available for taking home the match. So surely a quite good chance for Orgless to finally grab a trophy. However, FlipSid3 lately delivered quite good shows, and put together several really well played matches, additionally they surely sport way more firepower compared to BarBarr and friends, so we're pretty sure we'll watch the Ukrainians winning a map and forcing Orgless into the 3rd one. About the Veto, in our opinion we'll watch Inferno and Overpass. If we nailed it, Inferno may go in favor of Orgless, while Fsid3 should have an edge on Overpass. Honestly we find the 1-0 advantage kinda inappropriate for a BO3, and we're oriented in believing that ex-PixelFire will be able to take at least a map and close the series, so our pick is a Low one on Orgless.

Empire are moving into this game after facing YP in the BinaryDragon Cup, not the most relevant event out there, but at least enough to warm them up a bit. However, CyberFocus and co. in the past months kinda failed to impress, and in the short-term they mostly achieved victories against sub-par opponents, failing to take down any noteworthy EU side. On the other hand, HellRaisers aren't on their best streak too, but despite the questionable results we cannot say they provided a bad show during the MLG Columbus Qualifier. Here Kucher and co. provided a good set of extremely solid fights against all their opponents, and after winning over Liquid and losing the OT versus Mousesports in the following match, they were on the edge to eliminate Liquid in the re-match, but a late game comeback triggered by Hiko prevented them the pleasure to hit a Major spot. Overall we're oriented in considering HellRaisers well advantaged on most of the maps, so even if Betting odds aren't really great we're oriented in going for an Average pick on HR.
http://csgo.guru/match/4204!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8517!$Ence!$Penta!$Ence!$0.52!$0.61!$-0.08999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy match to predict since we're talking about two lineups that have been quite inconsistent in the short-term. ENCE are rolling into this game after a quite disappointing run at Pantamera in late February, where they failed moving through the Group-Stage due losses against both Ancient and Preparation. Honestly a quite disappointing show from a team that was favored for reaching the final stage of the Swedish event. On the other hand, Penta are still messing with stand-ins since the departure of Davidp, and today they are fielding Lowel as 5th. However, the Germans are on a quite bad form since a long while, and the latest iteration of their roster never really managed to turn into a serious threat. Talking about maps, we're expecting to watch: de_mirage, de_cache and de_dust2. If we nailed the veto, Mirage should be in favor of the Finns, while both Dust2 and Cache can easily go either way. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, and overall we're expecting a kinda even contest, but at our end we're slightly more prone in favoring Allu and friends since we find them a bit more solid on the extended map-pool compared to Penta. So our pick is a Low bet on ENCE.

Ex-Enemy, playing as 'Selfless', have been a tricky team to follow, falling into a pattern of inconsistency after strong beginning to the year. Granted, the departure of Koosta was sure to disrupt team chemistry a bit, but they've managed a few solid performances with Nifty as well. So even if the roster changes surely turned down a bit their fire-power, Relyks and friends should be still a decent threat. They failed to find any success in Columbus, and missed an opportunity to grab a spot in the Major. So there should be higher importance placed on this match, with the LAN Finals at stake. After consecutive wins against TSM and NRG (the more impressive of the two), they've earned their shot at reaching the Gfinity Finals. OpTic on the other hand, as we discussed yesterday, have also fallen short of expectations, failing to qualify in their last three LAN qualifier events. Which has raised concerns about whether the Canadians can respond in high stakes matches. However, yesterday they took their first step in the right direction with an incredible comeback against Liquid in the Semi-Final, landing them in today's Grand-Final. Here NAF-FLY and the gang will look to repeat the 2-1 victory they achieved over ex-NME in Katowice Qualifier. As for this contest, there's no doubt OpTic has the advantage, considering the mostly dominant match history they hold over their NA counterparts. About the maps, there's good chances we'll watch de_inferno, de_overpass, and de_train. Assuming the Veto follows this path, OpTiC will be favored on Inferno and Overpass, while ex-NME will have the edge on Train. After what OpTic achieved against Liquid last night, Bettings Odds are pretty much trashed in the favor. Although we don't feel the percentages properly reflect the advantage, we do agree they should be able to grab at least two of the maps. So with these kind of percentages, we're oriented towards skipping this one with so little profit. Since Selfless isn't playing with their most consistent lineup, we don't consider an ICB reliable enough to risk. But if you must pick a side, our pick is OpTic.
http://csgo.guru/match/4207!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8528!$VP!$NiP!$NiP!$0.47!$0.33!$0.13999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$First EPL match of the evening, and we're starting with the pedal to the metal by featuring a pretty great classic. However, worth saying that these legendary rosters aren't really flying high anymore, and even if they are still sitting within the Tier-1, we can't say that they are offering shows on-par with the stuff that the Top3 teams are delivering since 6 months or so. Anyway, Virtus.Pro finally displayed some signs of improvement during Katowice, but after a pretty decent Group-Stage where they dismissed EnVyUs and FaZe, the Poles ended their journey in the Quarter-Finals suffering a kinda embarrassing 2-0 sweep against Fnatic. Overall we're expecting to watch TaZ and co. regaining a decent form at some point, but actually they are still a kinda big question mark, in particular in online matches. On the other hand, NiP in Katowice didn't play a bad Group-Stage either, and even if they failed to reach Quarters, they still managed to win over Luminosity and offer a tight challenge to Fnatic as well (14-16). Talking about the current contest, NiP in the past 3 months played just a couple of times on de_cache, in both occasions delivering quite disappointing results, so we've some concerns about their form on this map. VP followed a quite similar pattern too, but overall managed to take home slightly more promising shows. Betting odds are trending in favor of the Swedes, but honestly de_cache is going to be a pretty balanced map, so at our end we're oriented in attempting a Low pick on Virtus.Pro in order to take advantage of the slightly more rewarding percentages.

We already discussed the form of both sides in the previous game, so here we'll just add that Overpass used to be a kinda strong map for Virtus.pro in 2015, but as soon as we moved to the new year they regularly failed to setup anything consistent on it, not only versus top-tier opponents but also against Tier-2 lineups. NiP on the other hand always played Overpass on a not-so-regular basis, since the Swedes always favored Cbble over it, however their last shows on this map have been surely a bit more promising than the VP ones, and even in Katowice they managed to keep their game against Natus Vincere on the edge, so we're oriented in giving them a little advantage over the Poles. Betting odds are still decent for a Low pick on NiP, so we're oriented in taking this path, even if there are surely good chances to watch a pretty balanced matchup.

Yesterday EnVyUs switched Kioshima for the former LDLC youngster DEVIL, a move motivated by the disappointing results that the team displayed in Katowice, and this is going to be his first official game wearing the Envy colors. Overall we're oriented in considering this change as a pretty huge one, and even if it may payoff in the long run, we don't really believe it will work too well in the short-term, in particular now that the Counter-Strike season is entering into two months filled by extremely important matches. Additionally worth saying that Gamers2 are also one of the worst opponents that EnVyUs can face, the French derby always been extremely balanced, and turned in favor of G2 multiple times, so we're pretty sure that Scream and the gang will try to take advantage of the roster issues of their opponents. Talking about the map, de_cache is generally a pretty good map for both teams, and on it they always managed to setup good shows, so we're oriented in considering this matchup mostly a 50/50 one. Betting odds are still quite even, and this is correct, but honestly at our end we're oriented in going for a Low pick on Gamers2 since we find them slightly more solid roster-wise.
http://csgo.guru/match/4210!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8531!$EnVyUs!$G2!$G2!$0.55!$0.41!$0.14000000000000007!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last European EPL match of the day, and just another episode of the french derby between EnVyUs and Gamers2. As we mentioned in the previous game as well, Envy yesterday enforced a pretty serious roster change, bringing in DEVIL from LDLC instead of Kioshima. This is going to play a critical role in the today's matches, in particular since they are fighting their fellow countrymen and rivals Gamers2, a roster that always gave them more than an issue, in particular in BO1s. For this contest we're moving to de_train, a map where both teams provided kinda inconsistent results in the short-term, alternating extremely good shows with kinda weird defeats, basically without following any real pattern. Generally we're oriented in believing that these teams always played Train relying a bit too much on their fire-power, so we'll likely enjoy a pretty momentum based match, where the team coming here with the better form from the previous game will likely take home this one as well. Anyway, historically we always had serious concerns about how Gamers2 handle the late-game, and this is a map where managing it properly is extremely important, so even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch Shox and co. doing well (in particular if they'll grab Cache), we're a bit more prone in picking a Low bet on EnVyUs, since they are usually a bit more 'progressive' in their performances compared to G2.
http://csgo.guru/match/4211!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8544!$Cloud9!$OG!$OG!$0.52!$0.64!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving on to tonight's North American games, and we'll get started with the another batch of EPL matches, featuring quite an interesting matchup. One of the top teams of the NA tier-1, Cloud9 has gradually improved as the year has gone along following an extended holiday break, and will enter the week after managing to qualify for the MLG Major in Columbus. Although they had surely setup a couple of decent matches, overall we still have concerns over their consistency. However, Cache is one their stronger maps, so we wouldn't be surprised to see them get off to stronger start. Meanwhile, OpTic are fresh off their Grand-Final victory over ex-Enemy to clench a spot in the Gfinity LAN Finals. After failing to hit any LAN qualifications in their first 3 chances this year, they finally rose to the occasion when it counted most. Particularly since they had to eliminate Liquid in the Semi-Final beforehand. Overall, they appear to have turned the corner, riding a decent winning streak in the short term. So the Canadians have managed to restore some of the confidence they lost earlier in the year. But we need to note, although they've found success on Cache, they have struggled some on it with higher ranked teams. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor the American-side, which we're inclined to agree due to the map. However, C9 has also experienced some issues in dismissing lower ranked teams on Cache. Plus the Canadians are sure to carry some momentum with them into today's bout. So here with percentages being quite rewarding for Low Bet on OpTic, we're oriented toward taking this path for the more profitable risk.

We discussed in the first match, OpTic has recently turned their fortunes around, and finally managed to seize a LAN qualifier after several missed opportunities earlier in the year. In addition to the qualifying win over ex-NME, they carry a decent winning streak into today's action. A factor which should give them some advantage for the first map, but less relevant for this second. Particularly on de_cbble, where they've had very mixed results. On the other hand, Cloud9 has been idle for over a week, so we wouldn't be surprised if they experience issues in countering the aggressive Canadians early in this head-to-head. However, they should be warmed up by the time they 2nd map begins, and we'll expect a performance closer to their most recent level. Particularly on cbble, where skadoodle and the gang have put on some of their best shows. So we feel they be more effective in their executions here, and offer a more solid effort. Betting Odds are much more balanced, while still favoring C9. On our end, as outlined above, we're more confident in their chances here, and feel they're the more reliable pick for this map. So our pick is a Low Bet on Cloud9.

Overall, we're not expecting any huge surprises out of this BO1, and even if the Swedes are generally a bit more dangerous in these kinds of matches compared to BO3s, we don't feel that they'll be able to take down Dignitas. Lately, the Danes aren't really on much a winning streak. In the short-term, they've faced more issues in taking home good results. However they should be well structured enough for dealing with DenDD, a mix mostly focused on fire-power rather than strats. Betting odds are trending in favor of Dignitas, and we're prone to agree, so our pick is a Low+/Avg- bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/4214!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8546!$WinterFox!$LG!$LG!$0.3!$0.06!$0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Second batch of EPL matches, and here we're moving to a matchup that will likely end without any huge surprises. Luminosity are rolling into this game after a pretty great run at IEM Katowice, where they moved through most the EU sides in pretty impressive fashion, prior to biting the dust in the Grand-Final against Fnatic. The Brazilian side have taken huge steps ahead in the past months, and they're actually the roster leading the NA scene. So we don't believe we'll watch them experiencing relevant issues in this contest. On the other hand, WinterFox aren't currently enjoying their brightest of moments. Despite having looked pretty on-point until early February, in the short-term they faced pretty critical issues, falling short against teams that they used to beat on a regular basis just few weeks before. As we already mentioned, we don't believe that de_overpass will trigger any surprises, and generally its a map where LG has always performed pretty well. So at our end, we're oriented toward going for an Avg bet on Luminosity. However, worth noting that Betting odds are currently pretty horrible, and as usual when we have 90/10 percentages we highly suggest to evaluate a skip.

We already discussed the form of both rosters in the previous game, but honestly there isn't much to recap besides the fact LG are actually the hottest American team at the moment, and one of the greatest world-wide. hile WinterFox are experiencing issues since a month or so, delivering kinda inconsistent results and feeling a bit lost compared to the form they showed early this year. Here on de_train we might watch a slightly closer game compared to the first map, but honestly we really don't believe we'll watch Luminosity sweat too much, and the Brazilian side should be fully capable of taking home the victory. Just like the previous game, again here the Betting odds are already kinda trash and basically not at all rewarding. So you can just skip without regrets. But if you want to pick a side anyway, just stick with Luminosity.

http://csgo.guru/match/4232!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8559!$E-Frag!$Ancient!$Ancient!$0.52!$0.46!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy BO1 to predict. Ancient are coming here after hitting a pretty decent streak during the past week. The Swedish mix managed to take home the Pantamera Challenge in Stockholm, basically their first noteworthy result after a rather extended mixed bag of performances. However, worth noting that they weren't facing any super relevant opponents. Aside from ENCE, Orgless and Alternate, the rest of the teams attending the event were kinda low-end. On the other hand E-Frag just moved back from IEM Katowice, where they failed to grab a Playoff spot, but still managed to take home a relevant victory over EnVyUs, which is surely more than we were expecting. Particularly based on the extremely high level of their Group. About the current match, we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game, with quite even Betting Odds as well. At our end we're prone toward picking a Low bet on E-Frag, since we find the Bulgarians a bit more solid compared to the peaks and valleys that Ancient delivered in the short-term.

Surely in the short-term SK have slowed their run a bit. And after about two months played pedal to the metal, the Danes started looking a bit weary, with their recent inconsistent results clearly reflecting this. However, Method aren't really the most scary opponent out there, and SK should be able to deliver substantially higher fire-power compared to the Russian side, so we're not too concerned about the SK form in relation with this contest. Additionally worth noting that Method aren't doing well either. Basically they never really managed to deliver performances on par with the Tier-3 EU sides, so we're not expecting them to offer a very solid fight. Betting odds are still quite fine for going Average on SK, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/4234!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8571!$Orgless!$YP!$Orgless!$0.6!$0.73!$-0.13!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Just another pretty low-tier match that will likely end without huge surprises. The former PixelFire roster, now known as Orgless should be a clear step ahead compared to YP. The EU mix lately managed to deliver quite acceptable results, and also finished in 2nd place the Pantamera Challenge in Stockholm, after losing the Grand-Final against Ancient. Shortly after, they managed to roll over FlipSid3 in the UCC Grand-Final, taking home their first trophy. On the other hand YP didn't achieve much in the short-term. Aside from a victory over Method, the Russian mix never really turned into a solid threat for the European sides. Since we're talking about a BO3, we highly doubt we'll watch Orgless failing this match, so we're oriented in going for an Avg pick on ex-PixelFire, since there are pretty good chances to watch SKYTTEN and co. continuing their good streak.
http://csgo.guru/match/4235!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8554!$EnVyUs!$FSid3!$EnVyUs!$0.6!$0.67!$-0.07000000000000006!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$First EPL match of the day, and on paper quite an interesting one. Yesterday EnVyUs continued their streak of disappointing results by losing 2-0 against their fellow countrymen rivals Gamers2. As we already mentioned, at our end we're kinda concerned by the roster change that the French team triggered just after IEM Katowice. DEVIL is surely a promising player, but honestly changing KioShima during a part of the year packed with events was kind of an unneeded risk. You cannot just throw a youngster in the heat of the battle without giving him enough time to adapt, and pretend that he'll fix all the issues of a team. Its simply wrong, and won't fix anything in the short-term (but ofc may work in a couple of months). However, while G2 are a pretty tricky opponent, FlipSid3 should be a slightly more manageable one. Even when its worth noting that the Ukrainians are coming here riding quite a decent winning streak, and just from a pretty good run at the MLG Columbus main qualifier, where they managed to grab a spot for the next Major by rolling over a very promisingTempo Storm. Anyways, de_mirage is generally a map in advantage of EnVyUs, and lately Fsid3 haven't really impress on it, so we're expecting to watch the Frenchmen taking it home, even if Markeloff and co. may make them sweat a bit more than usual. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on EnVyUs, so we're oriented in taking this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/4236!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8555!$FSid3!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.4!$0.28!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second EPL match in a row for both sides, and here we're moving on de_cbble, a map that should lead to a slightly closer contest compared to Mirage we watched before. As we already discussed in the previous match, we find the roster change that EnVyUs enforced right after Katowice a kinda rushed decision, and we're pretty sure that will lead to several more upsets over the short-term. On the other hand, FlipSid3, after months of mixed results, finally managed to find some consistency. In the past weeks, they've hit a decent streak of good performances, together with a spot in the next Major. Talking about the current match, Fsid3 are generally a bit better on Cobblestone compared to Mirage, and even if during the last Quarter EnVyUs delivered pretty good shows on this map as well, we're oriented in believing we'll watch a close game, particularly if the Ukrainians focus on quick executions rather than playing defensive. Just like the previous match, again Betting odds are still pretty balanced, so despite we believe that Fsid3 can do well we don't find the current percentages rewarding enough for going with an ICB on Markeloff and co., so we'll stick with a Low pick on EnVyUs.
http://csgo.guru/match/4237!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8556!$Na'Vi!$FaZe!$Na'Vi!$0.58!$0.71!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second set of EU EPL matches, and we're moving to the hottest contest of the evening. Natus Vincere are rolling into this match after offering a relatively mediocre show at IEM Katowice, where they entered as one of the favored teams, but finished their journey in the Semi-Finals after a quick 2-0 sweep delivered by Luminosity. Previously the Ukrainians had issues against the other Brazilian side as well. Even their Quarter-Final versus Tempo Storm beacme way closer than expected, with GuardiaN and friends sweating extensively to clear their way to Semis. However, at Katowice FaZe surely delivered way less than NAVI. The EU mix failed to move out from the Group-Stage, and generally never offered a convincing show, falling short against all the relevant opponents and winning just over Efrag and Tempo. Overall Maikelele and co. have displayed serious issues in dealing with top-tier teams. Even if stuff may go a bit better in online matches compared to LAN ones, they are still a pretty huge question mark. Talking about the current match, surely de_dust2 is a map quite prone to upsets, since generally the team sporting the strongest momentum take home the game. Additionally, NAVI are usually a bit slow in their entry game, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch a match closer than expected. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of NAVI, but even if they surely sport a decent advantage, at our end we're oriented toward gambling with percentages by going for an ICB on FaZe.
http://csgo.guru/match/4238!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8557!$FaZe!$Na'Vi!$Na'Vi!$0.42!$0.31!$0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last EU EPL match of the day, and now we're moving to de_mirage for another contest between Natus Vincere and FaZe. While the first game could be slightly more balanced due Dust2 being prone to upsets, here on Mirage things should be more streamlined. We already discussed the current form of both teams in their previous contest, so here we'll just add that we're expecting to watch NAVI doing better compared to their first game, since they've always managed to deliver pretty acceptable shows on Mirage, in particular against Tier-2 opponents. Its worth saying that FaZe recently haven't performed too bad on this map either, but overall we're prone to considering them kinda inconsistent and way too much 'fire-power centered', which is something that doesn't work too effectively on a map such as Mirage. Betting odds are basically the same of the previous game, so we're not really talking about extremely exciting percentages. Overall we find Natus Vincere as the way to go, and quite suitable for a Low+ pick, but we suggest to keep an eye on the values and eventually go for an ICB on FaZe if the odds will hit the 20/80 threshold.
http://csgo.guru/match/4239!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8575!$NRG!$LG!$LG!$0.4!$0.18!$0.22000000000000003!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$First batch of NA matches in this 12th day of EPL Season 3, and we'll get started with the most exciting matchup of the group. For a rather acquainted NA division, this will actually be the first meeting of these two. Despite the random success we've seen from NRG, they fallen into an up/down pattern, never managing stack wins to advance their positioning. Although, they've been mostly playing against some the higher end NA teams, and surely putting up strong effort to be cautious of. On Inferno, we've a small sample size, but more recently they've been more successful. Luminosity on the other hand, have made their presence well known at the top of the NA scene, as well as the international, with repeated deep runs with the high stakes. Aside from the out of the ordinary random miss we saw last night against WinterFox, the Brazilians have been stacking wins online like pancakes. And Inferno is a map they've been quite successful on, particularly online. As for this match, we wouldn't be surprised to see the EU/NA mix of NRG make this a much closer than expected contest. But still feel it's too solid of a map for TACO and the gang to upset, so we're going with a Low Bet on Luminosity.
http://csgo.guru/match/4240!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8576!$LG!$NRG!$LG!$0.6!$0.89!$-0.29000000000000004!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row both teams, as we make our way over to Mirage. Again, we feel NRG could be a little problematic for Brazilians. But their tendency of inconsistence makes them a bit of a question mark. After handling CLG by exceptional margins, they followed up with a lackluster performance with ex-Enemy, who played with a standin, that mostly unraveled as the game progressed. So they're a difficult team predict. Meanwhile, we're all aware of the level of Luminosity, with their dominance at Katowice up to the Grand-Final folly against Fnatic, fresh in our minds. However, Mirage hasn't been their stronger map. So if theres a chance for an upset on of these two maps, the chances might be slightly higher here. Betting Odds are of course heavily in favor of the Brazil-side, so our LG pick isn't quite profitable enough, so we're oriented toward risking a Low-ICB Bet on NRG to split the 2 map set.

While their first set of games against the Brazilians are going to be pretty hard for the EU/NA mix, the following ones against coL should be slightly easier to handle. In the short-term, Frod and the gang failed to deliver a serious fight in most of their contests, other than a victory over ex-Enemy they've mostly collected a long series of defeats and kinda disappointing shows. On the other hand NRG are still one of the NA teams to watch, and overall they offered several quite promising fights, despite the lack of result. However on de_cache, its going to be a pretty tricky map to guess. Here, coL have provided a mixed bag of results and honestly we don't find them extremely reliable. Meanwhile NRG played it kinda rarely, even if with slightly more encouraging results. Betting odds are still pretty decent for a Low pick on NRG, so on our end we're oriented towards taking this path since we find them a more solid pick compared to the coL randomness.
http://csgo.guru/match/4242!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8578!$NRG!$coL!$NRG!$0.52!$0.71!$-0.18999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last EPL match of the day, and 4th in a row for NRG. Honestly we wouldn't be surprised to watch the EU/NA mix start dropping the ball a bit after so many consecutive BO1s played, particularly on a map such as de_dust2 thats always pretty prone to upsets. However, as we mentioned in the previous contest as well, CompLexity aren't really perfomring their brightest moment, and aside from a victory over ex-NME, they basically only achieved a long series of fails and a bunch of minor victories over unranked rosters. Anyways, as we wrote above, while generally NRG are extremely on point on de_dust2, and under normal conditions, they should sport a clear edge over most of the NA Tier-2 teams, but here we're prone to believing that they'll join this game fairly tired and out of focus. In particular after their stressing entry games against LG. So at our end we're oriented in attempting an ICB on CompLexity.
http://csgo.guru/match/4243!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8564!$Splyce!$AGG!$AGG!$0.58!$0.72!$-0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Mid way through the North American portion of today's schedule, as we begin the 2nd NA Bracket of CEVOS 9. Not the most exciting matchup out here, but a repeat matchup from last night's EPL schedule However tonight, they battle a contest featuring the extended map-pool. SPLYCE surprised everyone in Columbus at the end of February , but managing to qualify for the Major in their unusual 2nd opportunity, after a rather horrid run of matches. Moving back online yesterday, they managed to maintain much of their momentum as they rolled past AGG in fairly easy fashion. Last night's consecutive losses has been much of the story lately for the struggling AGG squad. These past few weeks they failed to sustain any offense across the 3rd Tier, after showing some signs of life mid-february. And considering the form AbE and friends seem be performing at the moment, we don't think AGG will be able take 2 maps in this contest. As for the maps, we're expecting to watch de_cache, de_inferno, and de_overpass. Assuming the Veto follows this path, Splyce will be advantaged on Cache and inferno, while AGG will have an edge on Overpass. Betting Odds are already skewed well in favor of the American side, which is correct based on the current form of both teams. So, we're oriented towards going for a Low+ pick on Splyce, but if the percentage pass the 85/15 threshold, we're inclined to at least risk a ICB on AGG in case Splyce falls back into their prior online tendencies.

However, on paper, we should enjoy a pretty decent contest. First point of note, Vexed are now known as noKappa, after they parted ways with the Org following their not so exciting recent results, that culminated with a pretty huge fail at the MLG Columbus Main Qualifier, where they ended up losing to Splyce and Liquid, and then missed their chance to hit another Major. Penta on the other hand, are experiencing troubled times as well. They are currently playing with a stand-in (Lowel) after they removed Davidp from the active roster a couple of weeks ago. However, the German side is still struggling in finding their dimension, and overall they are quite unreliable. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, but at our end we're oriented in going with a Low pick on ex-Vexed since we find the Poles slightly more solid than Penta.

EnVyuS are landing into this game after the poker of mixed results they achieved after dismissing Kioshima in favor of the former LDLC White youngster DEVIL. Honestly we don't believe that the wind changed for the Frenchmen yet. Their loss against Gamers2 came with little surprise, since their fellow French/Belgian rivals have been smart in taking advantage of the lack of chemistry related to the roster change. While we're not prone in considering the following victory over FlipSid3 as a super-relevant one, since we're talking about a team that could have been dismissed also with the former lineup. So for now we're not really sold to the latest iteration of their roster. On the other hand, Astralis are surely on a way more convincingly streak, and even if retaking their full form is taking more than expected, the Danes are finally on the right path, and overall we're talking about a team with solid roots and consistent in most of the maps and format, so currently they are without any doubt way more reliable than Envy. Talking about this game, de_train always been a map where KennyS and co. experienced issues, and generally they never really managed to play it on par with the rest of the top-ranked teams. Even if frequently they hit close scores on it, we rarely watched the French side taking home victories, while Astralis are usually more reliable, even if their level on this map is still slightly below the FNT/NAVI one. Betting odds are widely in favor of the Danes, and as we stated above we're prone to agree, so our pick is a Low+ bet on Astralis.
http://csgo.guru/match/4269!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8581!$Astralis!$EnVyUs!$EnVyUs!$0.55!$0.7!$-0.1499999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for both sides, and now we're moving on de_inferno, a map that should be more balanced compared to Train we reviewed in the entry game. We already discussed about the recent performances of these rosters in the previous contest, so here we'll just underline that the recent lineup changes enforced by EnVyUs didn't really improve anything yet, and Astralis are generally more solid. The Danes used to play a lot on de_inferno in 2015, and it used to be one of their signature maps, but lately they mostly focused on a different batch (cache-mirage-overpass), leaving their old best pick mostly as collateral choice in BO3s. However, despite their performances on this map dropped a bit compared to their brightest times, they are still sporting an edge over EnVyUs, since the French side in the last Quarter followed a similar pattern, but with way worse results. Overall we're expecting a pretty tight fight on Inferno, but at our end we're prone to agree with the current Betting odds, and we're again oriented in picking a Low bet on Astralis, since we find them in better form.
http://csgo.guru/match/4270!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8582!$VP!$G2!$VP!$0.47!$0.31!$0.15999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second batch of EPL matches, and we're rolling into a contest that is going to be pretty tricky to predict. Virtus.Pro during the last Quarter collected a long series of extremely disappointing results, and even if they displayed some signs of improvement in Katowice, where they managed to move through their group and land in the Quarter-Final, overall they are still way below their 2015 form. Without doubts they are one of the top-tier teams that paid the highest bill from the lack of training during the Xmas-January break. On the other hand, Gamers2 are surprisingly sporting a pretty great momentum, few days ago they took advantage of the EnVyUs issues for taking home an extremely important double EPL victory, and now they are joining this game with an extremely high motivation and form, something we didn't see in the French/Belgian roster since a long while. Obviously they still have to work a bit on their BO3 performances, but in BO1s they are actually a pretty serious threat for every single Tier-1 team around. In the new year PashaBiceps and friends played on de_train just a couple of times, and in both occasions they pulled out horrible performances. But worth noting that in 2015 they used to be quite decent on this map, so we're oriented in believing that these results were mostly triggered by the lack of form rather than map-related issues. However, surely Shox &amp; co. displayed better things on Train in the short-term, and at our end we're oriented in giving them an edge. Betting odds are still decent for going Low on the French side, so our pick is Gamers2, with the hope to watch them keeping their streak.
http://csgo.guru/match/4271!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8583!$G2!$VP!$G2!$0.52!$0.55!$-0.030000000000000027!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$After Train, both sides are continuing their battle on de_overpass. In the previous match we already mentioned the issues that Virtus.Pro had to face in the mid-term, and their overall kinda poor form. But honestly on Overpass we're expecting to see the Poles bouncing back a bit, and even if in the past weeks they didn't trigger any great result on this map, they have a long history of decent shows on it. On the other hand Gamers2 never really focused too much on Overpass, and aside few peaks mostly delivered thanks to great personal performances, they rarely managed to setup a proper &amp; consistent plan. However, this is basically a pure 50/50 match that can easily go either way. Without any doubt G2 are sporting a stronger momentum, but at our end we wouldn't be surprised to watch Virtus.Pro waking up a bit as well, so we're oriented in attempting a Low pick on VP in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/4272!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8584!$SK!$FaZe!$SK!$0.45!$0.23!$0.22!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Third set of EPL matches, and now we're moving to a quite interesting mid-tier contest. Both teams aren't jumping here in their best form, SK after beginning the year in a great way started slowing down their run, and in the past few weeks they collected a pretty long series of inconsistent results. Aside a couple of minor victories, they ended losing against Ancient and E-frag, a couple of teams that the Danes were fully able to beat just few weeks before. On the other hand FaZe aren't performing any better, and actually they're sitting on a pretty terrible losing streak. Surely in the short-term they mostly had to mess with high-end teams, and this didn't help at all, but overall we were expecting them to perform way better, in particular since they're sporting an all-star roster that should be able to handle BO1s in a decent way. However, talking about de_cache, both teams never really excelled on it, and overall we don't believe they really trained this map on a regular basis in the short-term, so at our end we're oriented in favoring Maikelele and the gang due the higher fire-power that the EU mix can field. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on FaZe, so we're oriented in taking this path.

Overall both teams aren't on a great streak, but at least C9 displayed promising things during the MLG Columbus Main Qualifier, while coL are having relevant issues since a long while, and actually they are sitting on a pretty horrible losing streak. However worth noting that the latest iteration of the Cloud9 roster isn't really solid yet, and despite they surely did slightly better than coL, they aren't really reliable, and still quite prone to random peaks and fails, so this is going to be a pretty risky match. Additionally de_overpass isn't really the most consistent map within the NA scene, and even if C9 generally displayed better things, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a close contest. Betting odds are currently skewed in favor of Shroud and co. and this is correct, so at our end we're oriented in picking a Low+ bet on C9. But since the percentages are still moving a lot, we suggest to evaluate an ICB on coL as well, in particular if values will hit the 20/80 threshold.

We already covered the current form of both teams in the previous game, so here we'll just remind you that we're talking about two lineups that in the short-term delivered a pretty long batch of disappointing results. Despite Cloud9 are surely sporting a pretty good fire-power, they are still floating in a kinda unclear limbo, and their lack of relevant results is turning into a serious issue. On the other hand CompLexity, after a promising start of the year, slowed down their run, and lately they failed to hit any relevant performance. On de_cache we aren't expecting a pattern different from the previous match we reviewed, and Cloud9 should have a decent edge on this map as well. Betting odds are again quite fine for a Low+ pick on C9, so we're oriented in going with them since we find N0thing and the gang a slightly more reliable pick than coL.

Renegades are a team extremely prone to random peaks and valleys, and even if they frequently managed to hit surprising performances, we really can't see them as a reliable pick. Surely they sport a good potential, but they deliver their good shows on a way too inconsistent basis, and overall they are mostly momentum driven. On the other hand OpTiC are surely slightly more solid, the Canadian roster is joining this match after hitting a pretty good winning streak, and honestly we're kinda happy that they managed to move out from their February slump without any need of roster changes. However, despite the promising results, this is going to be a pretty hard match for them, and playing against Renegades is always kinda complex due the lack of clear references. On de_inferno we're expecting a kinda balanced contest, and we wouldn't be surprised to enjoy OTs as well. Anyway, at out end we're slightly more oriented in sticking with OpTiC, since we find them a bit more reliable than the Aussies.

Here we're moving to de_cbble and basically this map is following the same pattern of the previous one, since both teams are looking kinda aligned on it. As we already stated in the previous match, we find Renegades pretty unpredictable, and guessing their peaks is always pretty complex since they don't really play on a regular basis, and additionally they have a playstyle that can frequently lead to upsets, in particular in BO1s. Unlike the previous game, on de_cbble we're more oriented in attempting a Low pick on the Aussies, the Canadian side despite sporting an higher fire-power and a better momentum basically never really focused on Cobblestone, while Renegades frequently managed to deliver decent results, so at our end we're slightly more confident in trying our luck on the Australian roulette (and percentages are also more rewarding for taking this path).

As we already mentioned, both teams are facing a pretty rough moment. In particular for FaZe, the lack of positive results may lead to relevant roster changes in the short-term, since the North American organization in January paid about $700K to acquire the team from G2, and we're pretty sure they were expecting results aligned to the top-tier rather than with the mid-Tier2. However, while we were oriented in giving an edge to FaZe in the previous game due Cache being a neutral map for both sides, here things are pending in favor of the Danes. SK always played Mirage in a pretty good way, and used to be one of their signature maps as well, so we're confident we'll watch the Danish side countering the FaZe fire-power with their brain, and generally this is quite effective in a rather slow map such as Mirage. Odds are currently trending in favor of the EU mix, but at our end we're oriented in going with SK instead, mostly because we find them quite decent on this map (and the betting percentages are more rewarding too).

Since CSGL made the recent roster change of bringing back MINISE in place of oskarish, the team has finally seemed to develope some good chemistry, managing to stack together some solid outings. Aside from the random fail to FSid3 at the beginning of the month, they’ve offering more signs of encouragement than we’ve seen from the Poles in recent months. Penta on the other hand, has taken a slide down the ranks over the past quarter. And really only offering up decent results in irrelevant contests. In their most recent bout with the Polish-side, they looked a good step behind. As for the Maps, there’s good chances we’ll watch de_cache, de_cbble, and de_mirage. If we nailed the Veto, the Poles will be advantaged on Cache and Cobblestone, while the Germans will have the edge on Mirage. Betting odds are still decent, give a similar favor to the polish-side. On our end, we feel CSGL is the more reliable, percentages are rewarding for Low Bet on them as well, so we’ll follow that path.

After a very strong finish to 2015, and nearly two months of progress from SK, the Danes have all but come to hault. The issues that they are experiencing in the short-term, culminated in their failure to grab a spot at the Main Columbus Qualifier. Aside from a few irrelevant victories, the Danish-side have mostly reset to the form we saw last fall, which the Swedes were ables to exploit in their most recent bout two days ago. Ancient on the other hand, join this tournament, carrying respectable string of wins. Since the Swedes failed to qualify in the Columbus Last Chance qualifier, they’ve done a full 180, and rolled their way to victory in the Pantamera Challenge, which they completed with clean sweep of Orgless in the Grand-Final. For this contest, theres good chances we’ll watch de_inferno, de_overpass, and de_train. Assuming the veto follows this trend, Acient will have the edge on Overpass, while SK will be favored on Train, and Inferno could easily go either way. With the Swedes recent win over the struggling Danes, the current betting Odds are trending in favor of repeat result. On our end, we’ve serious concerns over the current state of SK. So although we’ll likely see all three maps, we feel the Swedes momentum should carry them through this entry game, so our pick is Low Bet on Twist and friends.

After a disappointing showing during the heart of Katowice, E-frag managed a couple of decent performances in the GameShow Invitational and GO:CL. Most notably was an Overtime victory of a struggling SK squad. Overall they’re in decent form coming into the weekend, but looking at the talent-pool for the event, we doubt they’ll offer any surprises past the Quarter-Finals. CPH Wolves on the other hand, have shown glimpses of potential, but they remain a level below much of 3rd Tier. They managed couple of solid efforts, earning them draws with ENCE and Vexed in mid-February. So they’ve surely shown the they’re capable of threatening the Bulgarians, but highly doubt they’ll manage to take more than a single map in the BO3. Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of the Bulgarian-side, which is correct when comparing the current levels of the two. On our end, we surely feel E-frag should take the match, and percentages are still rewarding for Low Bet, so we’ll follow this path.

However, we’ve limited expectations at the moment for the former Vexed squad, now independently playing as NoKappa after parting ways with the organization. The team separation from the org was a bit surprising, with a growingly repeated trend of orgs failing to fulfill contractual obligations. This state of limbo and distraction commonly yields negative results, as we saw in the loss vs Penta in the Rising Stars league. Meanwhile, Gambit has been a bit of a surprise lately. The young group of Russians most notably showed their potential in wins over Renegades and Cloud9. The victory of the Aussies surprised many, and qualified Gambit for the upcoming MLG Columbus Major. Surely a pretty impressive accomplishment. Having seen so little from the Russians, predicting the Veto is kinda tricky. But based on their tendencies, we’re expecting to see de_cache, de_cbble, and de_train. If these are the maps, Gambit should have a slight edge on Cache, while Cobblestone should favor Vexed, and train could go either way. On our end, we see the Russians as the team on the rise, so we’re oriented in going with them for Low Bet.

Honestly we're not expecting huge surprises out from this game, Astralis in the past few weeks almost regained their full form, and overall they shouldn't face any real issue in dismissing SK. Surely regional derbies are always a bit tricky, since they generally follow a different pattern compared to International games, but on de_train Cajunb and friends lately provided pretty consistent results, so we doubt we'll watch them having troubles in dealing with SK, in particular now that the Danish youngsters slowed their run a bit and started providing mixed results. There isn't much else to add since the Betting odds are already kinda trashed in favor of Astralis. At our end we don't really believe we'll watch an upset, but as usual when we talk about contests featuring 90/10 percentages we highly suggest to skip the whole thing due the low profitability. However, if you really want to pick a side, the way to go is Astralis.

According to what we discussed in the previous contest as well, we doubt we'll watch any surprise, and also this game should be in clear favor of Astralis. As we already mentioned Device and the rest of the team are slowly regaining their full form, and Mirage is surely one of the maps where in short-term they stepped up the most. SK aren't too bad on this map as well, but according to the issues they faced yesterday versus FaZe, we don't really believe that today they'll manage to take home more than 10 rounds or so. Betting odds are still decent for an Average pick on Astralis, so we're oriented in taking this path. However we suggest to keep an eye on the values and eventually skip if the percentages hit the 90/10 mark.

Gamers2 are without any doubt on a pretty consistent run, and actually the French/Belgian mix is experiencing its highest form to date. Surely they are still a bit shaky on several maps, in particular during the late-game of the slow ones, but overall they are feeling pretty on-point and finally quite aligned with the mid-T1 performances. On the other hand FlipSid3 in the short-term experienced more valleys than peaks, and even if on a couple of maps they are still quite dangerous, on most of the map-pool they are failing to provide consistent shows, and we clearly watched this early today in their struggles against Preparation, during the DH Malmo Qualifier. Unfortunately for G2, out of all the maps where FSid3 are generally shaky, for this game they ended on Train, one of the two where Markeloff and friends are quite consistent and overall a decent threat. Betting odds are actually widely trending in favor of Gamers2 due their Form and because the highest Fire-Power, basically ignoring that FlipSid3 are actually decent on de_train. At our end we're slightly more oriented in playing the odds, attempting an ICB on FlipSid3, with the hope to watch them put up a decent fight.

While de_train we reviewed in the previous matchup may lead to surprises, we don't really believe that FlipSid3 will manage to hit the top on Overpass. The French/Belgian side should be a decent step ahead on this map, and even if frequently here they ended choking during late-game, this time they should be able to dismiss the Ukrainians without leaving on the ground more than 10 rounds or so. We already discussed the form of both roster in their early game, so here we'll just add that generally FlipSid3 aren't solid enough to deliver two good performances in a row, so we aren't really expecting to watch Gamers2 losing this game. Betting odds are still decent for a Low/Avg pick on Shox and co., so we're oriented in taking this path.

There isn't much to say about [Fnatic], actually they're the team to beat, and in the mid-term they managed to hit an impressive streak of great results, basically dominating all the Major events they joined. For the Swedes playing BO3s or BO1s is basically the same since they are generally pretty on point on the whole map-pool. On the other hand Mousesports are rolling into this contest after playing in the DH Malmo Qualifier, so we're expecting them to move here already well warmed up, and potentially kinda tired. However, in the short-term the German side slowed a bit their run, and after a pretty consistent early 2016, just like many other top Tier-2 teams, they started dropping the ball a bit, in particular against Tier-1 opponents. Talking about this game, de_cache should be in favor of [Fnatic], and at our end we believe we'll watch JW and friends taking it home. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of the Swedish side, and barely profitable, so you can either skip or go Avg on [Fnatic].

We already discussed about the current form of these rosters in their previous game on de_cache. And as you may have figured out by your own as well, Fnatic are actually the team to beat for the whole International scene, and basically on every map. However, worth mentioning that here we're expecting to watch a slightly closer game compared to the first one, de_dust2 always been a pretty good map for Mousesports, and the German side shouldn't be underestimated on this field. Surely the Swedes sport a good advantage by default, due the amazing momentum and great form, but this is a match where we wouldn't be surprised to watch an Overtime or close scores in general. Betting odds are again extremely skewed in favor of Fnatic, but this time we'll avoid an Avg bet on them, and instead we're oriented in risking an ICB on Mousesports, since we believe that on Dust2 they sport decent upset chances.

CSGL is joining this match after defeating Penta with a 2-0 sweep, surely a good show from the Polish side that in the short-term managed to wake up a bit, after several months of rather disappointing results and kinda poor form. However, worth noting that Penta are experiencing structural problems since a long while, and the latest iteration of their roster never really managed to turn into a real threat, so they aren't exactly the most relevant opponent out there. On the other hand Dignitas had to deal with an even easier game prior this one, and they dismissed TDJSF in a pretty easy fashion. Overall the Danes recovered pretty well from their MLG Columbus Main Qualifier fail, and in the past week they hit a quite good winning streak, showing a decent form in all their Online contests. About maps, we're expecting to watch: de_mirage, de_cache and de_cbble. If the Veto will take this direction, Dignitas should be advantaged on basically all the maps, but we wouldn't be surprised to see close scores on Mirage and Cache. Betting odds are already pretty skewed in favor of the Danish side, but honestly we're prone to agree, so our pick is an Average bet on Dignitas.

However, worth noting that the French/Belgian side had to sweat quite a lot in order to land into this match, and their previous game against eSuba turned way more complex than what we were expecting. On the other hand, CPH Wolves aren't really the most consistent team out there, but overall they don't play too bad, and within the 3rd Tier they are above many other contenders, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking home a map if Gamers2 will join this game with the same motivation of their previous match against eSuba. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_dust2, de_cbble and de_overpass. If we nailed the Veto, G2 should sport a decent advantage on the whole map-pool, but Dust2 could be slightly closer than expected. Betting odds are still decent for an Average pick on Gamers2, so we're oriented in sticking with the French side.

On the other hand ex-Vexed, now known as NoKappa after their departure from the Danish organization, surprisingly managed to dismiss Gambit in their previous matchup, and landed here with pretty high hopes. The Poles always been kinda prone in experiencing random peaks, and as we already observed during the past 6 months, they always step up a lot when playing in this kind of Qualifiers. About maps, we're expecting to watch de_cbble, de_mirage and de_train. If we'll watch these maps, Mirage should be in clear favor of Mouz, while both Train and Cobblestone could be closer than expected. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of Mousesports, and even if we truly believe that we'll watch them taking home this match, we cannot really suggest to go with them with percentages floating around 90/10.

Honestly FSid3 aren't really experiencing their best form, and in particular on the the extended map-pool lately they are suffering way more than usual. On the other hand, Ancient are on a pretty good run, looks like that their victory at Pantamera Challenge boosted their confidence, and finally the Swedish side started playing as a real team instead of just a mix.

Mousesports are rolling into this match after closing the Sunday with an impressive upset over [Fnatic], where they delivered a stunning comeback and an almost perfect Overtime execution. Kinda surprising if we think that the Germans were at their 4th game in a row. However, worth mentioning that ChrisJ and friends, prior bouncing back against Fnatic, weren't really in their best week, and aside their good run in the current Qualifier they mostly hit disappointing results in their latest EPL contests. On the other hand, Gamers2 aren't really the best opponent to face in a decider, in the short-term the French/Belgian side stepped up a lot and actually they are sporting their highest form to date. Yesterday they started a bit slowly, but along the day they woke up quite a lot and after hitting this Semi they finished winning their EPL contests as well. About maps, we'll likely watch de_cbble, de_overpass and de_dust2.

Although compLexity has been mostly competitive in the majority of their matches, they’ve failed to achieve any positive results. When the current roster iteration came came together, we didn’t have the highest of expectations, but they’ve been a surprisingly more difficult obstacle for the higher ranked North American teams. During which they showed some promise, yet they haven’t managed to close out games, resulting in stretch of rather disappointing losses. As we saw last night in their Overtime defeat to C9, despite a 10 round T-side to push the contest to OT. Meanwhile, after a subpar start to the year for OpTic, missing 3 offline qualifiers, the Canadians have finally regained some of the form that earned them so much attention last qtr. Since losing to Tempo Storm in the Malmo Qualifier, they’ve finally come to life and have put together a solid run of victories including qualifying for the CEVO Lan Finals. And in the entry game on Overpass we’re expecting the pattern to continue, as its a map where they’ve always performed strongly. So again, this might be a closer match than expected, but we’ve surely more confidence in ShahZaM and the gang, so we’re oriented towards going with a Low Bet on OpTic.

As we’ve discussed many times before, OpTic Gaming was one of the hottest trending teams of the NA scene we’ve been quite excited about going into 2016. However the level of play that drew them so much attention, was absent in the early stages of the year. Over the short-term, the Canadians seem to have again found their rhythm and form, earning notable victories over Cloud9 and Liquid. And with de_cache being one of the strongest maps, they should advantaged on this game as well. As for compLexity, we already covered their current form in the previous game, so we’ll just add that Cache has quite a random map for dephh and friends. Here they’ve a mixed bag of results, but against NA’s top tier opponents, coL has fallen by surprising margins. So again, we highly doubt this is the contest where they’ll manage to turn their fortunes around. As with Overpass, we’ve to give a pretty decisive edge to the Canadians. As long percentages remain rewarding enough, we’re once more oriented towards another Low Bet on OpTic.

AGG isn’t the most difficult opponent out there, who’ve only managed to couple of relevant victories shortly after the remnants of the SKDC lineup joined up to reserve their spot in this ESL season. However, a few days ago they grounded a high flying SPLYCE roster, in a convincing Gfinity matchup, in quite easy fashion. But its worth noting, we’re not placing too much stock in this win, since aside from the Columbus surprise Splyce achieved shortly before, they were team with serious issues, particularly in online matches. Renegades on the other hand, have also been a bit inconsistent, but since releasing Havoc and taking USTILO on full time, the Aussies have been offering more solid performances. Many of their troubles are have been emphasized in LAN competition, but they’ve been more successful in online matches. Yesterday we watched them put up a strong battle against OpTic, where the two each took a map. Its worth noting however, the Aussies have been rather lackluster on Inferno, including a couple of lopsided losses on it. Of the two games, the best chances for AGG to beat the percentages is on Inferno since its not a reliable map for the Australians. Current betting odds are trending in favor of the Aussies, which we’re still inclined to agree. So while a Low Bet on them is still rewarding, we’re oriented toward following this path. But of the percentages pass the 80/20 mark, we’d risk a low-ICB on a Canadian victory.

We already discussed the current states of Renegades and AGG for their first match, but things are even less balanced for this match, because we’ll be moving to de_cbble. The Australian bunch hasn’t focused quite as much on Cobblestone in the early stages of the year, but that hasn’t affected their results when playing on it. And yesterday, the put up a great show in a decisive 16-9 win over OpTic. Meanwhile, we honestly feel the chances for an AGG victory are even more remote for the second half of this matchup. We’ve only 2 contests to reference in evaluating the Canadians on Cobblestone, where neither NRG or CLG had much issue in dispatching AGG. Simultaneously, the Aussies have the same limited data to reference in planning to for this match, so we wouldn’t be surprised to see the Canadians take double digit rounds. Once more the Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of the Australian-side, and as discussed above, we agree they’ve a greater edge here than the first game. So our pick is Low Bet on Renegades.

Cloud9 is currently sitting right in the middle of the pack, having gone 4-2 in the first 6 EPL games, which actually does reflect the level we’ve seen from them in the short term. They've not quite gotten back to their form we saw before the holidays. But did manage to grab a spot at the Columbus Major with a sweep over Renegades. Then losing twice to OpTic highlighted their online inconsistencies. Ex-Enemy on the other hand, also recently fell against the Canadians, but that wasn't too surprising considering the lack of a stable lineup. However, Selfless is expected to have the same roster we saw put up a solid effort in the second of a BO3 with NRG. So this mix has showed potential to resume a form they lost earlier in the year. Nonetheless, Train has always been a strong map for C9, while we’ve yet to see ex-NME play Train with this lineup. This is mostly reflected in the current Betting Odds floating around 70/30 for C9. Which is a bit excessive considering C9 hasn't beat we've only sporadically watched C9 perform effectively. But we agree C9 should be able to take this one home, so we’re going with a Low Bet on Cloud9. But if we see 75/25, we’ll risk a Low on a Selfless upset.

We previously mentioned Ex-Enemy hasn't until recently had a settled lineup since Koosta moved Liquid, but was back for the Columbus qualifier, since they qualified with that lineup previously, but failed to secure a spot in the Major. Though disappointing, not very surprising. But ironically Liquid did qualify with a stand-in. Anyways, the entire process was surely a distraction, but lately nifty and m1tch have been pretty much regulars, and the gang found their stride a bit in the short term, making C9 an appropriate test. Meanwhile Cloud9 have been kind of a mixed bag on de_cache, but overall, it map they play well and often. Even in their losses on it, the rd differential was marginal. Additionally, yesterday they completely dominated compLexity, lead by Stewie2k's impressive 27 kills with 5 deaths. But again, we've to give the edge C9, as they look to gain some ground on Selfless in the EPL seeding. Betting Odds are a little less lopsided here, than the first game. On our end, although we think this may be a pretty close game, that may even see OT, but we haven't seen enough from this Selfless roster to consider them more reliable than Cloud9, so C9 is our pick for Low bet.

FlipSid3 are landing in this BO3 following a mixed bag of not so exciting results, and even if yesterday they somehow advanced to the Semi-Final of DreamHack Malmo Qualifier, we can't really say they managed to deliver stunning performances in their way through the bracket. And aside the sweat and tears they had to drop to beat Ancient and Preparation, the Ukrainians failed offering any resistance in EPL, where the teams involved are generally more on-point and decently Tiered. On the other hand ENCE aren't really the most consistent team out there, the Finns are experiencing structural issues since the very first days, and they repeatedly failed in delivering consistent shows even in events where they joined as favored. In the short-term Allu and co. looked pretty shaky and they ended losing against mixes such as TDJSF and Preparation, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them struggling in this game as well. About maps, we're expecting to watch de_cbble, de_mirage and de_train. IF the veto will take this path FSid3 should be advantaged on Cobblestone, while Mirage and Train can easily go either way. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, but at our end we're prone in going for a Low pick on FlipSid3 since we find them slightly more reliable on the extended map-pool compared to ENCE.

However, worth noting that ex-Vexed, now playing as NoKappa after they parted ways with the organization, always been a roster kinda prone in delivering random peaks and valleys. In the past we frequently observed the Poles switching from offering good shows against high-tiered teams, to hit the dust versus unranked opponents, so today we wouldn't be surprised to watch scores closer than expected. However, Empire aren't really the most scary opponent out there, and even if lately they did pretty well within the Russian scene, they always faced some issues in replicating their good shows versus western sides. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on ex-Vexed (NoKappa), so we're oriented in sticking with them, with the hope to watch a solid performance.
http://csgo.guru/match/4322!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8648!$Method!$Ence!$Ence!$0.4!$0.23!$0.17!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Pretty low-end game between two teams that in the short-term are experiencing more valleys than peaks. Method in particular consistently failed to setup decent shows against European sides, and also within the Russian scene they aren't really providing exciting results. So overall we don't really believe we'll watch them bouncing back in this BO3. We already discussed about ENCE early today, so we'll just add that their current situation is kinda messy, the Finns are playing in a pretty inconsistent way since their inception, and their latest matches ended in a pretty disappointing way, despite they weren't really facing relevant opponents. Betting odds are already quite horrible, and kinda trashed in favor of ENCE. Honestly we believe that that the Finnish side will take home this game as well, but we wouldn't be surprised to watch them losing a map in the process. According to the current percentages, you can either skip the whole game or just stick with ENCE for an Avg bet.

Compared to the other game, here we've a kinda unexpected contest and we're kinda surprised to see CSGL so far in the bracket, in particular since the Poles managed to hit a pretty relevant upset over Dignitas, noteworthy mostly because it happened in a BO3. Something surely promising for the Polish side, according to what the Danes put up in the short-term. On the other hand FlipSid3 aren't facing their brightest moment, they are moving here after a couple of pretty tight matches early in the Qualifier, and overall also in EPL they are having a kinda troubled run. About maps, we'll likely watch de_train, de_cbble and de_overpass. If the veto will take this direction, the Ukrainians should be advantaged on Train, while CSGL will likely grab Overpass, and Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of FlipSid3, and we're prone to agree. Percentages are still decent for going with a Low pick on Markeloff and friends, so we'll stick with them.

We already saw OpTic grab the first spot for the CEVO S9 Finals, and now we're in the first round of the Second NA Bracket with another Finals seat up for grabs. We've discussed Renegades recent form since USTILO became a fixed position on the roster. Over the short-term, the Aussies have surely been playing decently, and getting positive results for it. Since failing to qualify in Columbus, they've have had 3 strong online matchups, particularly against the Canadians, who've been rolling as of late. In their last meeting with WinterFox, the Australians won both EPL games in convincing fashion. On the other hand, WinterFox have actually had a less active schedule in this first Quarter. Despite a strong start to the year, Anger and co. has really struggled with executing their strats. A few days ago had a very random win over Luminosity, where Wfx nearly put up a perfect T-side over one of the best teams in the world. So they've certainly the potential, but far too inconsistently. Considering the current form of the Aussies, we doubt Wfx will manage to take more than a map. Looking at the Veto, there's good chances we'll watch de_train, de_mirage, and de_inferno. But on paper, Renegades has the advantage across the map-pool, while the American-side's best chances are on Mirage and Inferno. Betting Odds are already skewed too far in favor of the Aussies, so we're oriented towards skipping, but if we gotta pick a side, Low on Renegades is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/4325!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8646!$TSM!$coL!$TSM!$0.48!$0.51!$-0.030000000000000027!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Just another low-tiered matchup in this opening round NA Bracket #2, and really not too much to say about two teams who've failed to achieve any favorable results in recent weeks. We recently learned that Vice was parting ways with TSM, leaving a vacancy in the lineup, which tonight will be filled by adreN as a tryout. AdreN was recently part of the Liquid roster to secure a spot in the Columbus Major, but only as a stand-in for koosta. Needless-to-say, this is expected to improve a TSM lineup that really hasn't yet found any relevant success. Meanwhile, compLexity's run losses continued last night, in two contests basically dominated by OpTic. Its safe to assume, if this failed experimental lineup continues on this pattern, we'll probably be seeing some changes again in the near future. But as we mentioned before, coL has done some things right, but just aren't getting the desired results. But again, we wouldn't be surprised to see pretty close scores, and maybe even some OT. We haven't yet seen these two face off, but based on the Veto Pattern, we'll likely watch de_cache, de_mirage, and de_train. While coL has mostly been playing BO1s, TSM has been mainly playing games on the extended map-pool. So this combined with adreN stand-in, we've to give them a edge on this BO3. Betting Odds are expectedly trending in favor TSM, but we surely feel this should be a much closer to even contests. And though we inclined toward a picking TSM, we oriented more toward playing the percentages, and picking for the higher reward since this could easily go either way. So we're going risk a Low Bet on compLexity and hope they'll break the pattern.

Dignitas are actually experiencing pretty hard times, in the short-term the Danish roster, despite being on the top of our Tier-2 chart, started experiencing extremely relevant issues, culminated with the disastrous 2-0 loss versus CSGL that prevented the Danes to qualify to DH Malmo. On the other hand Natus Vincere didn't really play a lot since their Katowice journey, and aside a victory over FaZe achieved a week ago, they mostly took a break from official matches. However, they are surely sporting a stronger momentum compared to Dignitas, even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch NAVI starting slowly in their entry match. On de_mirage, GuardiaN and co. are generally quite fine, so they should sport a decent advantage, but we need to note that Dignitas used to be decent as well (prior their latest inconsistent performances). Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on Natus Vincere, so we're oriented in taking this path rather than risking on the Danes.

We already discussed in the previous game the form of both teams, so here we'll just add a reminder about the current shaky moment that Dignitas are experiencing, and about the low work-load on the Natus Vincere shoulders, that may lead to scores slightly closer than expected. In the short-term NAVI provided quite decent performances on Overpass, and even if as team they generally favored Cobblestone over it, without any doubt they know how to mess with this map, and according to their latest showings they sport a gameplay pretty aligned with the mid-Tier1. Dignitas used to be pretty fine on it as well, and during mid-February they hit a couple of relevant upsets on this map. However their actual form is way below the one they were sporting at the time, so even if we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing decently, most of the chances should be still in the NAVI hands. Betting odds are again acceptable for a Low+ pick on Natus Vincere, so we'll stick with Guardian and friends one more time.

The French/Belgian side is rolling into this match after suffering a 2-1 loss against Mousesports, that prevented them to grab a spot at DH Malmo. This result also interrupted the pretty long streak of positive and promising scores that Shox and co. were collecting since a couple of weeks. However, aside the tight game against Mouz, G2 are generally doing pretty well, so we don't believe they'll face many issues in taking home this contest. On the other hand, SK after a stunning great start of the year, just like many other mid-tier teams also the Danes started slowing down their run, and in the short-term they turned quite inconsistent, even if they still managed to deliver an upset against FaZe a week ago (but worth noting that Maikelele and the gang are always kinda random, so don't take this result as extremely relevant). Talking about this game, G2 should be quite ok on de_train, and if they'll follow the pattern they delivered during the past few weeks, they should be able to dismiss SK with a score floating around 16-12. Betting odds are still decent for a Low pick on Gamers2, so we'll take this path as well, with the hope to watch G2 bouncing back after the yesterday fail.

In the previous contest we widely discussed the current good form of G2 (aside the yesterday fail vs Mouz), and how SK aren't really experiencing their best weeks. While what we wrote before was mostly correct for balanced maps, Cache is not going to follow the same pattern. Here the French/Belgian side frequently experienced peaks &amp; valleys, and overall this is a map where they mix on a regular basis impressive upsets with terrible fails, delivering a gameplay mostly focused on personal performances rather than solid plans. Surely SK never been the de_cache gods as well, and they aren't really famous for strong shows on this map (aside the peak vs FaZe), but overall we're prone in finding their upset chances slightly higher compared to de_train. Betting odds aren't really amazing, and overall kinda meh for both sides, however we might try an ICB+/Low- pick on SK, with the hope to watch the Danes replicating what they put up versus FaZe.

OpTic has been quite active over the short-term, and we've repeatedly discussed the high form the Canadians are currently performing. Other than the Brazilians, OpTic has been rolling over most of the NA division, entering this game after dominating compLexity on back-to-back maps. So we're not expecting this match to hold any surprises, particularly on Inferno, where OpTiC has played more effectively in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the struggles of WinterFox continues to disappoint. Other than the random decent outing, which is occurring with less frequency, they've arrive today with little to optimistic over. In the past, while the Canadians still played for Conquest, Wfx used to hold the map advantage. But since then, ShahZaM and friends has stepped up a solid level, while WinterFox has arguably declined. So again tonight, we're not expecting them to make OpTic sweat too much. Betting Odds are pretty much trashed in favor of OpTic. As usual with such unprofitable percentages, we recommend evaluating a skip. But if we must pick a side, a Low Bet on OpTic is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/4331!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8678!$WinterFox!$OG!$WinterFox!$0.42!$0.19!$0.22999999999999998!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row of this EPL contest between WinterFox and OpTic, but this time we're moving to Mirage. Theres not too much more to add regarding this matchup, besides what we already covered in the first game. Historically, WinterFox is more familiar on de_mirage, but they've never really achieved any relevant wins on it. And when looking at games of note, they're results have been incredibly inconsistent. And since Wfx hasn't been very active to begin the year, this is a map they haven't really focused much on with the current lineup. OpTic on the other hand, have been quiet solid on it. And their more aggressive playstyle, compliments a map such as Mirage, making it difficult for most of the NA teams to counter. So once more we're looking at contest that shouldn't hold any surprises. Considering this, we're once more looking at Betting Odds of little appeal. Although we might see anger and co. manage slightly better results here, we feel the Canadians are just too solid here to risk an ICB, so once again we're oriented towards skip this, but if we gotta pick a side, OpTic is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/4332!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8687!$coL!$Splyce!$coL!$0.47!$0.4!$0.06999999999999995!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving forward to our final batch of ESL Pro League matches, and although it might not be the most exciting match out there, surely a tricky one to predict. compLexity has yet achieved any positive results for their generally solid efforts. Despite the potential they shown on occasion, they continue to stack one defeat after the next. This lack of result has contributed in the organization trying out Witmer as a stand-in for fRoD, which didn't end as well as it started yesterday against TSM. After a top-notch performance on Overpass, they failed to close out TSM in OT to complete the sweep. After that, everything fell apart, as coL surprisingly finished 16-0 on Inferno, ultimately losing the BO3. So clearly their issues with focus and discipline beneath the surface of execution problems. SPLYCE on the hand is a difficult group to review. They generally pattern we've watched this lineup follow, is they only play well on LAN, while serious issues online persist. After what they achieved in Columbus, securing a Major spot, they returned to EPL, and put a couple of decent shows against AGG. (Who DAVEY and friends should be able to dismiss without much issue.) This was somewhat encouraging as a possible new trend, but in the following rematch with AGG, but with the Cevo bracket in play, the online follies returned, and Splyce was quickly eliminated in a convincing 2-0. So we really don't see them as too reliable either. As for this matchup, Splyce should be the favored team, but considering this is will be on Overpass where they yet to achieve desirable outcomes, we've to give the map advantage to coL. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor of Splyce, but on our end, we'll easily go with the a more rewarding Low Bet on compLexity, especially since Overpass has been one of their few solid maps.
http://csgo.guru/match/4333!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8686!$Splyce!$coL!$Splyce!$0.53!$0.35!$0.18000000000000005!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Final matchup of the day, and the second half of the EPL contest between SPLYCE and compLexity, this being played on de_train. As we covered in the first match, SPLYCE has been a bit of an enigma. For the most part, they've performed at a level on par with the Lower 3rd Tier. Early in the year, during the MLG Minors, we were reminding of the potential Splyce carried, as the beat the Odds to beat OpTic who was favored for the event. (Only to lose in the Grand-Final to ex-NME). But again, this level was only repeated offline in the Columbus Qualifier. Yet the majority of their online games were a clear step or two below their offline results. So we mostly keep waiting for AbE and the gang to get on the right path with performances closer aligned to what they've achieve d locally. Of the few results that may actually favored compLexity in this matchup, Train should be one of them. Not so much because of coL's strength on it, but moreso because it's a map they've payed slightly more focus on compared to Splyce. But as with the first game, this kind of a tricky contest to predict, especially since coL is fielding witmer on a a tryout basis, and they desperately seek some positive results. Things started to look promising as last night's match began, but ending with a map where they failed to grab a single round. However, they performance on Train was solid. Overall, this is a risky pick either with two so inconsistent teams. Once more we're seeing Betting Odds trending favor of Splyce, while Real World odds mostly even. So for this game, we're wait closer to match time to see how the percentages sit. Again, coL should actually have a slight map advantage, so currently we slightly more oriented toward risking a Low Bet compLexity to break their streak tonight, and take the higher reward.

Something surely weird, since few hours before the Poles ended losing against XPC Red, in a game that stunned many due the lack of focus displayed by MINISE and friends. On the other hand Empire failed to deliver any surprise versus the former Vexed squad, and just one more time the Russian side failed to offer a show on par with the European teams. Despite the peaks &amp; valleys provided in the past weeks, CSGL should be able to grab a victory here, so we don't believe we'll watch any huge surprise out from this match. Betting odds are still fine for a Low+/Avg- pick on the Poles, so we're oriented in sticking with them.

DenDD as we stated many times already, are mostly a mix, and by definition they are generally pretty inconsistent and not really prone in winning BO3 games that require a proper knowledge of the extended map-pool. Additionally, in the short-term the Swedes kinda lost their good momentum, and started having issues in BO1s as well. So they aren't really joining this game with the highest hopes. On the other hand E-Frag lately turned a bit inconsistent, and mostly collected a mixed bag of results. However worth saying that overall they are still looking kinda solid and on the long run we don't believe they'll lose more than a map against DenDD. About the veto, we'll likely watch de_mirage, de_cache and de_cbble. If we nailed it, Cache and Cobblestone may go to E-Frag, while Dendd may grab Mirage. Betting odds are already pretty skewed in favor of the Bulgarians side, but honestly we're oriented to agree, so our pick is a Low+ bet on E-frag.

Dignitas in the short-term delivered more valleys than peaks, and even yesterday they failed to bounce back versus Natus Vincere, despite the promising first map. In the past weeks the Danes played way below their average, and actually we've serious concerns about their current form, in particular because we're entering in a Quarter filled by extremely relevant events. On the other hand, Gamers2 after the fail against Mousesports (that costed them a spot at DH Malmo), quickly returned on the right path by beating SK in a quite convincingly fashion, confirming that the good results they collected in the past few weeks weren't a fluke, but a consistent trend. On de_inferno, the Frenchmen always provided pretty good performances, so they are stepping into this contest as favored, in particular since Rubino and the gang lately looked kinda shaky on this map. Betting odds are still fine for a Low+ pick on Gamers2, so we're oriented in picking this way.

Surely this is a map where the upset chance is slightly higher compared to Inferno, and Dignitas isn't new in providing good shows on Overpass as well, since they already managed to take down Virtus.Pro a couple of EPL weeks ago. However Gamers2 are actually more solid than the Polish side, and in the short-term the Frenchmen also displayed promising things on this map too (they rolled over F3 &amp; VP), so we're oriented in believing that Shox and co. will just continue their streak without any major issue. Betting odds are slightly more even compared to the previous match, mostly because Overpass is frequently an inconsistent map, but honestly, at our end we're prone in sticking with Gamers2 one more time, and also percentages are still quite ok for going with just another Low pick.

Yesterday DenDD provided a kinda shaky performance versus E-frag, and they ended suffering a pretty heavy 2-0 loss. As we stated several times already, the Swedish-mix lately dropped a lot in form, and aside few sporadic good shows in BO1s, they generally have serious issues in delivering consistent results in games featuring the extended map-pool. On the other hand, Dignitas aren't experiencing their best momentum either, but honestly we're talking about a team based on solid roots, and the Danes are also hitting this BO3 already well warmed up by their entry EPL contest versus Gamers2, so they shouldn't face critical issues in taking home this match. About maps, we'll likely watch de_mirage, de_overpass and de_cbble. If the veto will take this direction, Dignitas should be fairly advantaged on both Mirage and Cobblestone, while Overpass can go either way. Betting odds are still fine for a Low+/Avg- pick on Dignitas, so we're prone in going with them.

Fnatic are still on an incredible run, and a couple of weeks ago they took home just another extremely relevant title by winning the always prestigious IEM Katowice. However their following EPL contest against Mousesports turned a bit closer than expected, and the Swedes ended overlooking Dust2, a map that in the past used to be their curse for a while, and still one of the few ones where JW and friends always have to sweat a bit. However, aside the OT loss suffered versus the Germans, Fnatic are still on top of our 2016 Ranking, leading it by a good margin over NAVI. On the other hand, this has been a disappointing year for NiP so far. The old Kings struggled in most of the offline events they played, and even if Online they still displayed promising stuff, worth mentioning that they aren't really playing on a regular basis, unlike most of the other powerhouses are doing. So evaluating their current form isn't really easy, and overall they are a team that can always surprise, in particular in Derbies like this one and in BO1s in general. On de_cache both teams provided good shows in the short-term, Fnatic surely looked slightly more solid than F0rest and friends, but also NiP offered a bunch of good games, such as the 16-2 they achieved over VP a week ago. At our end we're oriented in considering this matchup as a balanced one, and we wouldn't be surprised to see NiP coming back from the Hell. So according to the current overly skewed percentages, we're slightly more oriented in attempting a Low pick on NiP, in order to take advantage of the more rewarding values.

We already discussed about the form of both rosters in the previous matchup, so here we'll just recap things mentioning that Fnatic are still the team to beat, and even if they ended losing de_dust2 against Mousesports their momentum is still strong, and in most of the other maps they are simply the team leading the pack. On the other hand, NiP mostly failed most of their 2016 objectives, and even if Online they looked more dangerous than Offline, their current form isn't really on par with the top-trending Tier-1 teams, however their short-term trend is surely promising, compared to how they started the year. On de_inferno we're expecting a quite even battle. Both teams already faced each other on this map during IEM Katowice, and that game turned into an extremely contested game, that Fnatic managed to take home only after dropping all their cards, avoiding the OT just by a tiny edge. Just like the match we reviewed before, we're oriented in following a quite similar betting pattern, in particular since we find that NiP may have good chances to deliver an upset in at least one of the 2 maps. So one more time our pick is a Low one on GeT_RiGhT and co., with the hope to watch an upset and exploit the overly skewed percentages.
http://csgo.guru/match/4345!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8697!$Cloud9!$Renegades!$Cloud9!$0.48!$0.56!$-0.08000000000000007!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving into the North American portion of today's schedule, and we begin with quite an interesting EPL matchup on de_train. As we discussed recently,Cloud9have been a bit inconsistent over the short-term, particularly in their online matches, achieving a mixed bag of results. Their last few matches have been against lower ranked teams, and they've been generally decent, but in the 2nd match vs a struggling ex-Enemy, C9 continued the pattern by way of a 16-4 loss. However, lately they been exceptional in Train, which is a much needed benefit against the Aussies who've been playing quite well as of late, and likely still sour about C9 grabbing the spot in the Columbus Major. Since falling to Cloud9 on LAN at the Main Qualifier, Renegades have been playing at a fairly high level. They split a set of maps with OpTic after the MLG event, then swept their following series against AGG and WinterFox. Though they're not the most significant wins, they're a testament to some solid performances. And like C9, Train is a map the Aussies have typically played well, however we haven't seen too much to references since USTILO joined the team. Regardless, they should surely be able to give the Americans a serious challenge. Betting Odds are trending in favor of Skadoodle and friends. Though we're inclined to agree, Real-World Odds a moreso aligned to even, so on our end, we're oriented toward seeing the Australians reliable enough on Train, go pick them for the more profitable pick. So we're going with a Low Bet on Renegades.

For the first contest between these two, we discuss the recent series of positive results that Renegades has achieved, since missing their chance to qualify for a Major at the hands of 2-0 sweep provided by Cloud9 a few weeks ago. But even before the offline qualifier, the Aussies had been playing well online, but failed to find the same results playing locally. However, Dust2 hasn’t really been a map they’ve focused too much on, and managed varied results playing it in the mid term. Meanwhile, Cloud9 has a slightly polar pattern to the Aussies, achieved better results offline. But on de_dust2, the Americans have usually offered stronger outings, so we’ve to give them the advantage here. But the Current Betting Odds are actually more closely aligned here. Considering we feel the Aussies might grab the first game, we doubt they’ll manage to take both, so our pick is Low Bet on Cloud9.

Here we're moving to de_train, a map that should be slightly more on the edge compared to Dust2 we reviewed before. We already discussed about the inconsistent performances of CLG and regarding the pretty terrible shows that CompLexity delivered in the short-term, that triggered roster changes as well. So here we'll mostly point out that coL on Train should have decent chances to deliver an upset, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch close scores. CLG obviously aren't too bad either, but overall they frequently displayed issues in winning two games in a row, so at our end we're slightly more prone in taking advantage of the super-skewed odds by attempting an ICB on CompLexity.
http://csgo.guru/match/4350!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8709!$VP!$Imm!$VP!$0.6!$0.9!$-0.30000000000000004!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$We kick off today’s busy schedule, earlier than normal as we’re in Split, Croatia for the Counter Pit Season 2 Finals. For the opening match, Virtus.Pro was one of the four teams previously invited, so they bypassed the online stage with a bye to the $80K offline event. Considering the form of the Poles this first Quarter, this is kind of a gift, since their slump during the February may have prevented them this opportunity. Other than a select few matches, PashaBiceps and friends have had serious issues with regaining the level they achieved last year. On the other hand, Immunity is lone qualifier from the Oceanic division, which they secure by finishing top of the 6 team online stage. Although the AU scene surely has some potential, overall, there's a substantial margin separating them from the level of the some of the competition present here in Croatia. Additionally, this is the first relevant match we’ve seen from IMTY this year. The Aussies even had difficulties handling some of the below T3 team they met in the DH Malmo Qualifier, while also having seen the departure of USTILO, who moved to Renegades. So we’re not expecting them to offer any surprises in this entry contest. But its worth noting, historically, IMTY steps it up a notch offline competition. So there’s a chance they’ll at least make it interesting. As for this match, because of the Pole’s recent struggles, the Aussies are likely the best match for the Polish-side to open the event with. Even some of their poorer performances over the mid-term have been still aligned or better than what Immunity should be able to offer. Particularly on the extended map-pool, where VP should have the edge across the board. Betting Odds are expectedly trashed with an assumed Polish victory, which as implied above we agree. With these percentages, and a day packed with games, we’re going to skip this one, since our pick Virtus.Pro practically offers no reward.

Surely we aren't really believing in an upset since we're talking about a matchup featuring the BO3 format, but overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch FlipSid3 taking home a map, in particular since Natus Vincere are frequently affected by slow starts. However, worth mentioning that lately FSid3 dropped a lot in performances, and in the short-term they ended losing many matches where they were supposed to be advantaged, in particular the loss in their latest game versus CSGL caused them Ukrainians to fail the qualification to DreamHack Malmo. Surely a big hit. On the other hand Natus Vincere are generally advantaged on the extended map-pool, and here they are also favored for hitting the Grand-Final, according to the not-so-great form that both EnVyUs and Virtus.Pro displayed in the past weeks. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of NAVI, so betting on them is actually a kinda waste of time due the extremely low reward. But if you really want to take a side, Guardian and co. are our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/4352!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8705!$Astralis!$Torpedo!$Astralis!$0.7!$0.97!$-0.27!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$While the previous couple of CounterPit contests are barely acceptable from a Betting Odds point of view, the percentages for this game are basically trash. And actually dropping a bet with values floating around 5% is basically pointless. Nonetheless, on paper, Astralis shouldn't face any relevant issue in rolling over the Swedes, since we're talking about a BO3. Especially because the Danes are actually one of Tier-1 teams sporting the better momentum. On the other hand, its worth saying that Torpedo aren't doing too bad, and they're actually a pretty promising Challenger team. But honestly, they aren't really ready to mess with teams above Tier-2 yet. Theres really not much else to add, as this is a plain skip (unless you like to bet on these super-skewed contests).
http://csgo.guru/match/4354!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8707!$HR!$ATN!$HR!$0.52!$0.46!$0.06!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$While much of our attention is focused on CounterPit, we’ve still have several other games in action on today’s schedule, including Season 4 of the Uprise Champions Cup, which we move to for a Low-Mid Tiered matchup. Despite the promise Europeans carried into the new year,and a decent start to the year for the PGL Minor in Romania, HellRaisers’ performances have since been on the decline. And over the mid-term, they’ve achieved quite a mixed bag of results, including a failed opportunity to grab a spot in the MLG Major. Shortly after, we learned of the departure of kUcher. In addition, HR are fielding a second stand-in in place of Styko as well, with Zero and queztone filling the two vacancies. So currently, we’re not expecting any significant results from the lineup over the short term, particularly against a German group on the rise. ALTERNATE aTTaX on the other hand, are sporting the same roster that eliminating HR from the APM Finals in February. Surely this isn’t the most intimidating team there, but the Germans have shown some encouraging things in recent weeks. And if they can top the EU-side today, they’ve legitimate chances of topping their UCC group. Although they’ve still some consistency concerns, more evident in their offline contests. As for this contest, as mentioned above, ATN managed to defeat HR in their previous BO3 matchup. Considering that contest, we’ve good chances of watching de_cache, de_overpass, and de_cbble. Typically, HR should have the advantage on Overpass, ATA should be favored on Cobblestone, leaving Cache which could go either way. Current Betting Odds are trending in favor of HR, however we see this contest much closer to even. Since HR will only be competing with ⅗ their normal roster, we’re slightly more oriented towards favor the German-side for this match. And a repeat of their previous encounter. So on our end, we’re inclined to take the more rewarding path, and going with a Low Bet on ALTERNATE aTTaX.
http://csgo.guru/match/4355!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8710!$G2!$FaZe!$G2!$0.55!$0.59!$-0.039999999999999925!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Aside from the CounterPit and UCC matches, we've also the usual river of pretty cool ESL Pro League contests. Actually kind of a more interesting game than those being played in the Croatian event, (at least for this first day.) Overall, FaZe vs Gamers2 is without a doubt the match of the day. The Frenchmen are rolling into this matchup following a couple of weeks filled with promising results. Even if we need to note that in the past few days they've slowed their run a bit. And the recent defeats versus Mouz and Dignitas highlighted some of their unresolved issues. However, G2 are surely sporting decent momentum. Overall, they should be slightly above the level of Maikelele and co. On the other hand, FaZe aren't really perfomrming at their peak.The EU mix, despite sporting a top-tier roster, has totally failed to deliver results in line with Tier-1, and they've regularly failed to offer shows on par with their name. However, de_dust2 is always a map kinda prone to upsets, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch FaZe bounce back a bit and offering a closer than expected fight. But anyways, at our end we've always considered FaZe fairly unreliable, particularly versus T1 teams. So while Betting odds are still balanced, we're prone toward sticking with a Low pick on Gamers2.

NRG are moving to this event following a pretty decent EPL run, where they achieved 4 victories in a row. Confirming to themselves, to be one of the hottest new teams of the North American scene. Despite the overall good shows, the NA/EU mix is still a bit inconsistent. While on the extended map-pool, they've recently failed to reach CEVO Finals, after suffering a loss against ex-Enemy. For this event, they are also fielding Tabsen instead of Ptr, so we might watch them having slightly more issues than usual. On the other hand, just a week ago EnVyUs had to deal with a kinda critical roster changes, following the disappointing show at IEM Katowice. They ended up switching Kioshima with Devil, and this will be the first lan for the former LDLC rifler. As expected, things didn't really improve in the short-term for the Frenchmen, as they've continued providing mixed results. Here odds are slightly more balanced, but overall still kinda skewed. And honestly we don't really believe we'll watch an upset. So our pick is just an average bet on EnVyUs.

Given that Gamers2 has historically always provided a good amount of peaks and valleys on this map, over the short-term, the French/Belgian lineup has looked slightly more consistent than usual. And if they enter the game with the right mood, they should sport a decent advantage over FaZe. On the other hand, Maikelele and co. played on Cache just a handful of times, achieving kinda inconsistent results. Honestly, this is not an huge surprise since the EU mix always focused way too much on personal plays, rather than on solid strat patterns. Betting odds are still quite balanced for a Low pick on Gamers2, and at our end we're oriented toward sticking with this path, since we find Shox and the gang more reliable than FaZe.
http://csgo.guru/match/4358!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8708!$CSGL!$Ancient!$CSGL!$0.52!$0.38!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Final contest scheduled today for the 4th season of UCC, and surely the league’s most interesting matchup today. CSGL has been a very inconsistent group, achieving drastically varied results over the last few weeks. While the Poles have managed some impressive and convincing victories over FlipSid3, Penta, and Dignitas, they’ve also a couple of unexpected defeats to Empire and XPC. So although, the Polish-side has surely showed steps in the right direction after a shaky month and a half to start the year, the pattern of inconsistency we saw last year is still a threat to their success. Meanwhile, the inception of Ancient has been a successful effort so far. Over the first Quarter, the Swedes have made a push through the ranks, offering performances aligned with Tier2. Most notably was their victory in the Pantamera Challenge, where they managed to finish top the group. Despite the overall recent success, their momentum was slowed a bit by FlipSid3 in the DH Malmo Qualifier, where the Ukrainians prevented the Swedes from an opportunity to secure a spot in the Masters. Coincidentally enough, F3 went on to be defeated by the Poles in the semi-finals of the closed qualifier. So we’re expecting a pretty tightly fought contest in this Group C entry contest. Again, we’re talking about a BO3, where we believe there's good chances of watching de_mirage, de_overpass, and de_train. Should the Veto follow this pattern, CSGL should be favored on Mirage, Train should favor Ancient, leaving Overpass which could easily go either way. Betting Odds are currently in favor of the Swedes, which is correct when considering the some of the random showings from the Polish-side. However, Real-World give a slight edge to Innocent and friends. On our end, we’re expecting a pretty balanced matchup, and feel Swedes loss against F3 as minor blip on an otherwise successful road. So while percentages are still rewarding for Low Bet on Ancient, we’re oriented toward following this path.

Mousesports are moving here riding quite a good winning streak. In the short-term, the Germans managed to bump up their form a lot, and their impressive comeback versus [Fnatic] clearly displayed that they should be considered a serious threat by other Tier-1 teams as well. On the other hand SK are actually swimming in troubled waters. After delivering pretty great performances for two months in a row, the Danes started dropping the ball early March, and since then, most of their recent matchups ended pretty disappointingly, with the Danish side failing to put up much of a fight, even versus opponents that they used to beat previously. Betting odds for this game are already kinda skewed, and edging the profitability threshold, but if the percentages keep floating around 75/25, we're oriented toward playing it conservative with an Avg pick on Mousesports.

Just like the match we reviewed before, we really don’t believe we'll watch any surprises. And actually the form displayed by the Danish side is kinda disappointing. While on the other hand, the Germans are rolling pretty hot, and in the short-term, managed to take home several really impressive results. Additionally, its worth noting that SK basically never really focused on de_cbble, since the Danes mostly preferred Overpass instead. Unlike the Danish side, Mousesports should be way more consistent on this map, and even if they don't play it too much as well, most of the time they’ve managed to take home victories with pretty good scores. So here they are surely way more reliable than Pimp and co. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on Mousesports, so we're oriented toward sticking with the Germans one more time.
http://csgo.guru/match/4363!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8716!$Renegades!$Liquid!$Renegades!$0.45!$0.31!$0.14!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving into the tonight's North American matches, and tonight we've some pretty exciting matchups on the EPL schedule. And we'll get started with rematch of a contest we watched out of the DH Malmo Qualifier a few weeks back. As we covered last night, Renegades have been playing improved in the short-term, except for Cloud9 and Liquid who've seemed to have the Aussie's number. Last night against C9, but just couldn't get the match point, ultimately losing in OT. Things went even worse on Train. So coming off of back-to-back defeats, and playing on Mirage, where they've had some troubles recently, could be quite a difficult test. Liquid on the other hand, have been playing with some momentum, achieving generally decent results since mid-February. A run that mostly got rolling with their sweep of the Australians. Even though we recently watched them fall just short against OpTic, it was a very balanced battle, that came within an OT of going the other way. Overall, they're in strong form at the moment, and will come into this game favored, particularly on one of their better maps. Betting Odds are skewed in favor of the Americans, although this is certainly not a match they'll run away with. They really had to sweat for their victory on Mirage in the last encounter. Since we think theres good chances these two will split the maps, with better chances here than the next map. So if the percentages float around the 70/30 mark, we'd consider a Low Bet on the Renegades, in hopes of a decent return.
http://csgo.guru/match/4364!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8717!$Liquid!$Renegades!$Liquid!$0.55!$0.68!$-0.13!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second half of tonight’s first NA EPL matchup between Liquid and Renegades, this time moving to Dust2. We discussed in the first game, the current level of Americans, having re-established their form on par with the NA Tier-1. We recently saw them in Columbus, securing their spot for the upcoming MLG Major. Right after, they also qualified for the DH Masters in Malmo in a convincing fashion, by way of a 2-0 sweep over CLG. In addition to the level of consistent performances they’ve been offered since adding Koosta to the starting lineup, we’re talking about one their best maps. So this isn’t a contest we’re expecting to hold any surprises. Meanwhile, Renegades failed to take advantage of all three opportunities they had to qualify for relevant events (Katowice, DreamHack, &amp; MLG). So what we’ve seen them setup in March, is surely progress from troubled outings displayed in the preceding weeks. However, Dust hasn’t been too strong a map for the Aussies in the short term, nor one they’ve focused on too much since releasing Havoc, when they achieved better results on Dust2. Current Betting Odds are actually quite balanced here, give a marginal edge to the American-side. On our end, we again expect a pretty tight contest, but feel S1mple and friends should be able take won the victory, so our pick is Low Bet on Liquid.

Luminosity are stepping into this game after hitting an impressive progression throughout these past months. In basically just a Quarter, the Brazilians managed to climb the World Ranking chart, and now FalleN and co. are consistently sitting amongst the top-three teams. However, it is worth noting that just a week ago, WinterFox managed to take LG by surprise and deliver a rather impressive upset. So even if Luminosity are surely one of the best teams around, and this fail was surely a rare occurrence, we should always keep in mind that these BO1s can be kinda unpredictable. However, talking about Cloud9, the North American side woke up a bit lately, and even if they're still extremely prone to delivering peaks and valleys. We're inclined to believe that they've finally managed to take some steps in the right direction. Here we're talking about a match taking place on de_overpass, a map where the Brazilian side has always provided extremely good results. A map where they've also managed to dismiss several EU powerhouses. So even if C9 could be able to keep the game on edge, at least for the first half, Luminosity should be still consistent enough to take it home anyway. Betting odds are already rolling in favor of LG, but as stated above we're prone to agree, so our pick is a Low+ one on Luminosity.

For this contest, the two giants moved to de_cbble. Overall, kind of a neutral map that could be slightly more open compared to Overpass we reviewed in the other game. We already discussed the form of these rosters in the previous prediction, so here we'll just remind you that LG are actually one of the top-trending Tier-1 teams, while C9 only recently managed to bounce back on the right track after a long series of mixed performances. On Cobblestone, the Brazilian side should still sport a moderate advantage. Aside from the better momentum FalleN and friends also proved on occassion to be quite on point on this map as well. On the other hand, Cloud9 historically used to perform well on this map too, but since they moved into the new year, they've repeatedly failed to play it in any consistent way. Betting odds are again skewed in favor of LG, and for just another time we're oriented to agree, so our pick is a Low one on Luminosity.

As we announced on our homepage as well, the Canadian roster has been dismissed to make space for the former (Polish) Vexed one, who re now officially representing AGG. However, it's worth remembering that prior this drop, the ex-AGG roster failed to provide any consistent shows. And with just a couple of peaks in the past month, they were one of the lineups that achieved less in this first Quarter. On the other hand, CLG are still facing their usual tendancy to be inonsistent. Mostly caused by a way to play too focused on personal plays, rather than well organized plans. However, their fire-power and map-pool knowledge is generally enough to take home a match like this, so we are not extremely concerned. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of CLG, with percentages that aren't really profitable, so you can either skip the whole thing or simply go for an Avg pick on CLG, if the inner-betting-monster sitting in your stomach is hungry and screaming.

For their entry game, Virtus.Pro met the Oceanic qualifier Immunity which pretty much went as expected. The Poles didn't have to sweat much, finishing with a mostly dominant performance on Inferno, so it's still hard to know what to expect from them. A handful of wins in an otherwise disappointing first Quarter, they haven't really delivered anything reliable. Yet we've still seen a few flashes of the of the more threatening days, so the CIS-side knows they can't sleep on them. Natus Vincere on the other hand, surely had a more challenging task with FlipSid3 that needed all three maps to determine who was going home. But as usual, GuardiaN took the reigns and ensured NAVI would make it to the Semis. Overall, despite NAVI having not quite won as convincingly as they have in the past, and have needed to work harder, yet still getting the desired results. And are surely amongst the top 4 teams in the world. However, some of their missteps could pose an opportunity for PashaBiceps and the gang to exploit. Honestly though, we doubt NAVI will surrender more than one map to Poles. As for the maps, there good chances we'll watch de_overpass, de_mirage, and de_inferno after the Veto. If this ends up the pattern, NAVI will have small edge on Inferno, Mirage will favor VP, and Overpass could go both ways. Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of NAVI, who held a pretty decisive edge in their past meetings. However, what the Brazilians managed against the CIS in Katowice surely exposed some vulnerabilities, and we may likely again watch a match closer than expected. But we still feel NAVI is the more reliable pick, so we're going with a Low Bet on Natus Vincere.

Yesterday NRG managed to deliver one of the greatest upset to date, and despite they were also fielding TabseN (who played stellar) instead of Ptr, they still managed to take down EnVyUs after an extremely tight BO3 and an even closer Overtime. We wrote many times about the pretty high potential of this EU/NA mix, but honestly what they achieved here is plain magic. However, while EnVyUs are experiencing issues since a while, and their latest roster change potentially harmed them more than what it helped, we cannot really say the same about Astralis. The Danes are one of the big favorites for moving into the Grand-Final, and overall a team that always been pretty solid, and lately also regained their full-form following a kinda slow start of the year. About maps, we'll likely watch de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_mirage. If the veto will take this path, the Danish side should have a clear edge on Overpass, while both Dust2 and Mirage could be closer than expected, in particular according to the good form displayed by NRG. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of Astralis. So, even if we believe that Device and co. will move ahead, much likely with a plain 2-0 score, we cannot really advice to waste time in betting on a match sporting percentages below 90/10. So just skip, or if you're feeling lucky you can attempt a YOLO ICB on NRG, with the hope to watch another episode of their Cindarella story.

In our event preview we clearly mentioned that there were extremely high chances to watch both Astralis and Natus Vincere reaching the final stage of this LAN, so at our end we're not really surprised about how the quarters/semis went (aside the upset pulled by NRG). However, Astralis are rolling into this game following a regular growth in form happened during the past months, the Danish lineup started the year kinda slowly but in the following months and in particular during the last 3 weeks, they started pushing the pedal to the metal, filling the gap from the top-3 leading teams. Here in Croatia, they managed to deliver two perfect matches, even if worth mentioning that due the NRG upset they ended into a quite 'easy' side of the bracket, while surely NAVI had to sweat way more in order to dismiss the well-ranked rosters they had to face. So yes, Astralis are surely looking really good so far, but this is going to be a pretty hard match, so don't expect to see Device and co. having an easy afternoon. On the other hand, as we mentioned above as well, Natus Vincere had to deal with a kinda messy road to the Final, they kicked-off the Quarter with a messy all-Ukrainian derby, always a tricky one, and they continued with the face-off versus VP, the Poles lately displayed promising things, even if they are still kinda out of form. At our end we're prone in believing that NAVI experienced their highest peak prior IEM Katowice, and lately their form dropped a bit, even if still quite aligned with the rest of the trending Tier-1 teams. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto will trend towards this direction, we'll enjoy a mostly balanced match, with Astralis slightly more favored on Overpass, and NAVI on Mirage, leaving Dust2 as a kinda risky middle ground. At our end, we're prone in giving the strongest momentum to the Danes, and betting odds are actually following the same direction as well. Percentages are still fine for going Low on Astralis, so this is our pick. But overall we're mostly talking about a match that can easy go either way.

With the 2nd NA Bracket for the 9th Season of CEVO underway, we move into the Quarter-Finals, for a pretty exciting matchup between the Brazilians and the Australians. We discussed in great length the level achieved in a short time by Tempo Storm, whose surge through the NA ranks began under the Games Academy banner, never slowing along the way. Most recently, Lucas and friends proved they were 'for-real' in Katowice, where they finished 2nd in their group to reach the playoffs. In the Quarters, they nearly eliminated one the world's top teams, Natus Vincere. Although the Brazilians fell 3 rounds short of reaching the Semis, what they managed against NAVI was nothing short of impressive. This performance, combined with over 2 months of mostly dominant efforts against the NA, demonstrated the threat they pose to the international scene. Meanwhile, Renegades hasn't had an active till these last few weeks. During which time, they've some mixed results, but aside from a select few of the NA's top teams, the Aussies have also been a team to watch out for. They walked over WinterFox with relative ease to reach this Quarter-Final, but we honestly don't think they'll be able to handle the Brazil-side through the extended map-pool, considering their struggles against the likes of Cloud9, Liquid, and OpTic. As for this match, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_inferno, and de_train. Assuming the Veto follows this path, Cache should favor the Aussies, Inferno will favor the Brazilians, and train could go both ways. Current Betting odds are trending in favor of Tempo, which we have to agree on, since they've been playing solid for some time now. Although we wouldn't be surprised to watch this go all three maps. Percentages are still rewarding for Low Bet on Tempo Storm, so they're our pick.

Honestly, here we're not reviewing a really super-amazing match. The TSM roster recently passed through some lineup changes, and AdreN stepped in to fill the shoes of Vice. On paper, this should be a switch pointing towards the right direction, even if we're still talking about a team mostly lacking raw firepower, rather than brain. However, its worth noting that the North American side faced a serious lack of decent results during the whole first Quarter. And only in the past few days they started looking a tiny bit revitalized. On the other hand, Renegades aren't doing too bad. They started the month in a pretty good fashion, hitting a good streak of positive results in ESL Pro League, but lately they dropped the ball a bit, and ended up facing troubles in facing the top-trending teams of the NA scene. About maps, we're expecting to watch de_mirage, de_train and de_cbble, and if the veto will go this way, we're oriented in giving an edge to the Aussies, since they should be slightly more reliable on the extended map-pool compared to TSM. Betting odds are still decent for going with a Low pick on Renegades, so we'll stick with them.

Selfless, despite their recent roster changes, and the relevant departure of Koosta, still managed to keep floating pretty well within the NA scene. And even if their latest results turned a bit inconsistent compared to what they achieved during the first phase of the year, they are still a solid opponent for most of the North American sides around. WinterFox followed a kinda similar pattern, and while they are actually one of the most unreliable teams of the whole scene as of late, they are still delivering impressive upsets on a daily basis, and surely victories over OpTiC and Luminosity are results that cannot be scrapped. However, they generally tend to shine in BO1s games rather than BO3s, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them facing hard times if the current match is forced to a third map. About veto, we're expecting to see de_overpass, de_inferno and de_cache. If this will be the case, Overpass and Cache should be in favor of Selfless, while WinterFox may grab Inferno. Betting odds are still quite fine for going Low on Selfless, so we're oriented in taking this path since we find them slightly more on point with the extended map-pool.

Mousesports have surely stepped up their game a level this year. Over the short term, we've watched the mostly German roster putting up performances aligned with Tier-1, which includes some notable victories over Gamers2 and Fnatic. However, they've not been quite as effective online on LAN. On the other hand, Faze didn't really get started with heavy schedule until March. In the early stages, we saw Maikelele and friends look promising after moving from G2 to Faze. But over the past two weeks, the Europeans have swam into rough waters, entering this weekend with a with series of disappointing losses. Historically, Faze have held the upper hand in the H2H matchup, but the considering the current form of German-side, we're expecting a change in pattern. As for this contest, we're beginning on Cache, a map where the Mouz should be advantaged on, collected a better set of results on it. While Faze haven't focused less on it, achieving some mixed results. Betting Odds are trending in favor of Mouz, which is correct considering the recent form of the two. Percentages are rewarding for a Low Bet on Mousesports, so we're oriented toward going this route.
http://csgo.guru/match/4937!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8743!$FaZe!$mouz!$mouz!$0.48!$0.37!$0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second half of today's first batch of EU matches between Mousesports and Faze, and here we're moving to de_dust2 for the 2nd showdown. This map should like hold a much tighter contest between the two. We already tracked the upward progress of Mouz, and downward path of Faze in the first match, so we've only to add a few points. Dust2 has been map we've seen both face some high level teams on, and despite the varied results, both have surely managed some of their better shows in. The notable difference in the two, is Faze failed to close out the games, where the Germans were able to the seal the deal. So we've quite tricky one contest here. The bigger advantage Mouz has achieved has been their strat execution. To the detriment of Faze on the other hand, they've fallen into the habit of focusing too much on individual performances. Which unfortunately, has been the difference in the few rounds separating them from more favorable results. If they can stay disciplined on team patterns, they've surely the firepower to counter Mouz and take home the map. Again, Betting Odds are trending in favor of the German-side. A trend we're inclined to agree, but since they've been slightly more inconsistent online, we're slightly oriented toward playing the percentages for the more profitable return. In hopes of seeing the Europeans break their pattern, we're going try a Low Bet of Faze.

Although this may be a slightly tricky one, considering Fnatic has looked a bit more vulnerable online than the invincibility they've displayed on LAN this year. In their previous 2 EPL series, both NiP and Mousesports managed to take at least one of the two maps. Beyond that, we all know the capabilities of the Swedes, referring to their collection of 2016 trophies already earned. Dignitas on other hand, have had a run of highs and lows, making them a bit of question mark in these Tier-1 matchups. The Danes put their skills on display at GEC, and their Grand Final appearance. So they've shown they surely have promise, yet over the short term, they missed the Malmo qualifier, where they were swept by CSGL, followed by a pair of losses to NAVI, they managed to take Overpass against Gamers2. So what you're gonna get is always hard to gauge. Better Odds are currently trashed in favor of the Swedes. This is surely the case since the Swedes are still good step above the Danish-side. Of the two maps today, Train has been slightly more problematic for Fnatic. Since Dignitas has managed some positive results in T1 matches on it, if we're gonna risk an ICB in on one of these maps, it would be this one. So we'll risk a Low or ICB (if you could use the space) on Dignitas and hope for a sparkling moment.
http://csgo.guru/match/4941!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8745!$Dignitas!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.42!$0.16!$0.26!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second half of this Swedish/Danish matchup for EPL Saturday. For the second game, we're moving to Overpass. As we discussed in the first game, Dignitas comes into the weekend with a mixed bag of results over the mid-term. They rolled over DenDD with relative ease earlier this week, by way of a clean 2-0 sweep. Not the most impressive win, but surely some positive fuel of confidence for the Danish-side. In addition, Overpass is map they've performed decently on, including a 16-10 victory over G2. So they've the ingredients to offer the Swedes a good fight. On the other hand, we're talking about one Fnatic's better maps, and one they've perfect on in 2016. In Katowice, the Swedes bested both Luminosity and Astralis on it, so despite the positives the Danish-side may carry with them, the hill is likely gonna be even steeper here. Again, Betting Odds are heavily favoring Olofmeister and friends, which correct when viewing their track record. With these percentages, we're oriented towards skipping this one, with such a busy schedule today. But if you must make a pick, our pick is Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/4948!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8738!$CLG!$TStorm!$CLG!$0.48!$0.33!$0.14999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving into the heart of Day One for the IBP Spring Invitational, here we've a preview of an upcoming CEVO Quarter-Final, and good match for the two NA T1 teams to size each other up. Due to event seeding, both teams received a bye in the first round, so they've both moved to the Quarters without warmup. CLG has kinda been a random group to predict, and also amongst the group of teams having already played a substantial number of contests this first quarter. Since they were inactive in January, their past 7 weeks have been packed with action. Following a kinda shaky start, CLG seems to have stabilized, but in the short term they're still dealing with issues of inconsistency. However, its worth noting with raised stakes, they come through, and managed to qualify for DH Malmo as well as the upcoming MLG Major. They'll enter the weekend with a couple wins in the bag, although they weren't the most dangerous opponents out there. As for dangerous opponents, Tempo Storm is among the most dangerous in the NA scene, and the Pro scene on the whole. Theres no too much to add about the Brazilians that hasn't already been covered. The young bunch is surely the rise, but still lack the experience needed to close out the high stakes offline events, as we saw in both Katowice and Columbus. And their recent battles with CLG, felps and boltz lead the charge in convincing fashion. As for this contest, theres good chances we'll watch de_cbble, de_train, and de_inferno. If the Veto goes this way, Train should favor CLG, Inferno will favor the Brazil-side, leaving Cobblestone as CLG's best chance to take the set. Current Betting Odds are skewed in favor of the brazilians. Considering their continued high form and consistency, we feel they're the more reliable pick. So our pick is a Low Bet on Tempo Storm.

This time we're not really expecting any huge surprises, and overall NiP should sport a pretty decent edge over SK. In the short-term, the Danes dropped a lot in performance, particularly if we compare their latest kinda average shows with top-tier teams, they've managed to put together just a month ago. Overall, a wide part of the Tier-2 rosters are actually experiencing struggles. So we're not really surprised to see Friis and co having hard times during this phase of the season. On the other hand, NiP surely failed to deliver convincing LAN results, but overall they are on a consistent streak in EPL. During which, aside from their last game they ended up losing versus Fnatic (but the series ended 1-1), they are one of the teams that performed better. Talking about the current contest, SK are generally quite decent on de_cache. But on the other side, NiP have stepped up a lot on this map during the past months, and here the Swedes delivered solid results against most of the other Tier-1 opponents. So even if we might watch a close score, we're prone in sticking with a Low+/Avg- pick on Get_Right and friends.

We already discussed in the previous game the drop in consistency that affected SK. Over the short-term, the Danes took home a bag of mixed results, and overall their level has decreased kinda below the kind of performance they used to deliver in the previous months. NiP are generally quite solid, but they still have to find a solid way for handling LAN events. But overall, online, they're doing fairly well and what they put up so far can be considered as aligned with the top-5. Historically, Mirage has always been one of the maps where the Swedes faced relevant issues. But for some time now, they started focusing on it a lot, and their current level is quite promising. So we're not really expecting to watch them facing huge issues in dismissing SK. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+ on NiP, so we're oriented in sticking with the Swedes.

WinterFox are moving here after suffering a heavy 2-0 loss in their entry iBP Invitational match versus Selfless. Overall, they looked kinda shaky. Honestly, Wfx are a team extremely hard to predict, basically beause they're prone to delivering peaks and valleys in fairly random order. Particularly in contests featuring the BO1 format. So even if their current form isn't really super-high, we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing better than expected on at least one map. On the other hand, after an entry part of the year played way below their full potential, Liquid finally stepped up a bit, consistently improving over the past month. However ,S1mple and the gang are still a bit prone in suffering random upsets, which we already watched happening a couple of times. So in general, we suggest to pay extra attention and avoid huge values. However, on this map (de_cache), Liquid should sport a fairly decent advantage, and at our end we don't really believe we'll watch WFox delivering any significant surprises, so we're oriented in going Low+/Avg- on Liquid.
http://csgo.guru/match/4955!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8755!$Liquid!$WinterFox!$WinterFox!$0.55!$0.84!$-0.2899999999999999!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$The second portion of this EPL matchup is taking place on de_overpass, a map that should be slightly more balanced compared to de_cache we reviewed before. As we already mentioned, Liquid are stepping into this game following a decent progression over the past weeks, even if they still look a bit vulnerable in BO1 contests. On the other side, WinterFox can be considered a good step below Hiko and co., but overall they proved to be dangerous if not taken seriously. On Overpass we might enjoy a closer match than expected, but honestly Liquid should still sport a decent enough advantage, particularly since we rarely watched WinterFox delivering stunning great shows on this map. And most of their previous games on Ovp have been played without following any real pattern. So our pick is again a Low+/Avg- pick on Liquid.
http://csgo.guru/match/4961!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8737!$Cloud9!$OG!$Cloud9!$0.52!$0.56!$-0.040000000000000036!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Our day packed with matches continues on, and now we move back to the iBP Invitational, for the the events last match of the day, but quite interesting matchup. For this Qtr-Final we've some high-tiered North American competition. Again, both seeds bypassed the entry round, advancing directly in the quarters. After a bit a rocky start in the early stages of the year, we've finally starting seeing some consistency from Cloud9 at a level we've always aligned their performances with. Particularly in past few weeks, where they qualified for the Columbus Major, and recently a sweep of Renegades followed by going 1-1 for their EPL set with Luminosity. The one obstruction along the way, was the Canadians they'll meet here today. OpTic on the other hand, as we mentioned before having been rolling in high form over the mid-term. But they too have been prone to the random BO1 upset, as they've fallen to both Wfx and Aussies, splitting both EPL sets. Overall, they've been amongst the hottest trending NA teams since February. As for this match, this will be the third meeting this year. C9 took the first in a BO3, while Optic evened the score, taking back-to-back ESL contests. So we're expecting quite a balanced match here today. As for the maps, we believe we'll watch de_dust2, de_inferno, and de_cbble. If the Veto follows this, C9 will have the advantage on Dust2, while Cobblestone will give the edge to Optic, leaving Inferno which could go either way. Betting Odds are currently quite balanced, giving some favor to the American-side. On our end, we're viewing this a mostly a 50/50 matchup, so we're oriented toward taking the more profitable path. So our pick is Low Bet on OpTic.

Here we're reviewing a pretty high tiered contest, where both rosters are rolling into this game after providing fairly convincing shows over the short-term. Luminosity are actually the top-ranked team of the NA scene, and in these kinds of online leagues can be easily considered as the team to beat. However generally the Brazilians are a bit more 'relaxed' in online contests compared to LAN events, so there is always some room for an upset. On the other hand, CLG are surely on a good streak, but worth mentioning that they didn't really face a proper set of high-tier opponents in the past weeks. What they achieved so far is expected from a top-notch roster like the one they sport. However, on Cobblestone we basically have no doubts in going with the Brazilian side as suggested pick, since they always provide pretty well rounded performances on this map. And in the past days they looked fairly on point as well, so we're oriented in going Low+ on Luminosity.
http://csgo.guru/match/4971!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8757!$LG!$CLG!$LG!$0.58!$0.69!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last match of this series and here we're moving to de_overpass. This is just another map where we don't really believe we'll watch any relevant surprise. Just like Cobblestone also here on Overpass the Brazilian side always provided pretty good performances, and played this map on a regular basis with consistent results, so they should be able to deal with CLG without sweating too much. On the other hand CLG, are always a bit random on this kind of 'new' maps, and even if they aren't too bad on it, we're not really prone in considering the North American side as a super-reliable pick, in particular since looks like that currently they are more focused in keeping their fire-power high rather than improving strats-wise. Betting odds are even more skewed than the previous contest, but still kinda decent for sticking with a Low+ pick on Luminosity, so we'll just go with FalleN and friends one more time.

Selfless are moving here after two games where they achieved stellar victories. While the first one versus WinterFox was kinda expected, the 2-1 one over Luminosity was more like a bolt in the blue, and surely stunned most of us since the Brazilians are actually sitting on the top of the North American ranking. Following these victories it's pretty obvious that Relyks and co. are now joining this match as favored. On the other hand SPLYCE aren't new to upsets as well, and after taking home a spot for MLG Columbus they kept doing pretty well in online matches too, so we're talking about a roster that should sport a form pretty similar to the Selfless one, even if probably featuring a slightly lower fire-power. Both teams aren't really amazing on de_inferno, but actually Selfless should be slightly better, and overall a tiny bit more reliable than SPLYCE, so at our end we're oriented in going Low on them.

For this game we're moving to de_cache, a map that on paper should be in clear advantage of Selfless, since it used to be one of their signature maps. Here Relyks and friends always managed to deliver pretty good things, and they clearly displayed their skills early today as well, when they managed to beat LG in a pretty impressive fashion. Splyce are generally a bit shaky on this map, and they frequently mixed pretty good shows with kinda poor ones. Overall we're oriented in considering them pretty momentum based, and kinda dependent by the personal performances of their players. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+/Avg- pick on Selfless, so we're oriented in going again with them, since they should be quite advantaged on this map.
http://csgo.guru/match/5374!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8736!$LG!$Selfless!$Selfless!$0.58!$0.92!$-0.3400000000000001!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving forward in the IBP Invitational Quarter-Final, between Selfless and Luminosity. Little time, so getting right to it. LG was top seed and awarded a bye through the first round. So this is their first game today. They're coming off a mediocre performance with Cloud9, where the two split the EPL set. But Overall, the Brazilians at right at the top near the Swedes, so they're surely a level above shakier American-side. Selfless on the other hand,had to work their way into this match, by sweeping WinterFox 2-0. But they had to sweat for the 2nd map, but managed to end it quickly. Overall, Relyks and co. don't quite sport the firepower to match the Brazilian-side, so we doubt they'll manage more than a single map with the extended map-pool in play. So our pick is Low Bet Luminosity, or just skip since the percentages aren't really rewarding enough.

Here we've actually a pretty interesting matchup, that may be much closer than expected. Liquid have come to form over the mid-term, setting up performances aligned with the NA Tier-1. However, their most recent matches with OpTic and Renegades were bigger tests for the Americans, resulting in a close 2-1 loss to the Canadians, and settling for 1-1 with the Aussies. Considering the fairly recent changes to the lineup, we're not surprised to see them having some issues in highend matches, but they don't seem to leveled off yet. Meanwhile, as we mentioned earlier, TSM recently added adreN to the lineup, which was sure to add some firepower, but what they managed earlier against the Australians in the entry round, what better than we anticipated. Despite their string in inconsistent results since joining the Org, they managed one of their best efforts to date, landing them a spot in this Quarter-Final. A tricky element to this matchup, is the TSM's new 5th man, who is not only familiar with Liquid's Strats, but he's also on their starting roster for the MLG Major. Surely, he can offer invaluable insights to properly counter his teammates on the other side. As for this match, despite the X-factor of adreN, we still to give the advantage to Liquid. As for the Veto, we've no match history to refer to, based on their histories, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_cbble, and de_overpass. Although Liquid should have the edge through the extended map-pol, when viewing what TSM achieved against the Aussies, their best chances will be on Cobblestone and Overpass. Betting Odds are currently skewed in favor of Liquid, which is to be expected with TSM's lineup having little history together. On our end, we wouldn't be surprised to see close scores and maybe a third map. So we're gonna wait to see how Liquid plays their other games before this one, but unless they unravel in those contests, we feel they're the more reliable pick. So we're going with a Low Bet on Liquid.

FlipSid3 are moving here after suffering a kinda embarrassing defeat versus Ancient, on a game that was supposed to be kinda even. In the past few weeks the Ukrainians started struggling kinda a lot, and overall they faced more lows than peaks. On the other hand Mousesports lately faced a light drop as well, but their slightly issues can be considered kinda aligned to the ones that most of the other top-Tier2 teams experienced in the past weeks, so overall we're not really concerned by their condition. On de_overpass Mouz always displayed quite good things, so we don't believe we'll watch them sweating too much, so at our end we're oriented in picking a Low+ pick on them.

EnVyUs are rolling into this game after an extremely disappointing month, where they basically failed all their objectives, and in the short-term they are also the Tier-1 team experiencing the most relevant issues, so at our end we're kinda concerned about their current form. On the other hand, Natus Vincere are entering this contest after triumphing at CounterPit Finals, where they managed to deliver a stunning show and confirmed themselves as one of the teams capable to challenge the Fnatic's leadership. On de_train NAVI always managed to deliver extremely good shows, and this is arguably one of their best maps, so we don't believe we'll watch them choking versus EnVyUs, especially considering the poor form that the Frenchmen are experiencing. Betting odds are still fine for a Low+ pick on Natus Vincere, so at our end we're oriented in sticking with Guardian and co.

As we discussed in the first match, EnVyUs have surely fallen on hard times as of late, mostly since the French decided to bring in Devil in place of KioShiMa, in what seemed a very hasty decision after a series of below par performances for the Frenchmen. But so far, this move hasn't paid dividends, and we don't believe their chances are gonna be any better on de_cbble. Meanwhile, Natus Vincere have been moving right along in strong form. As we said earlier, they've poised themselves in contention for the spot owned by the Swedes. Although they've had a few minor hiccups on Cbble, they've been quite dangerous on it. Even when the French were not in trouble times, NAVI managed to hold the map adv there more recently. So on our end, we're mostly aligned with the percentages trending in favor of Guardian and friends, so they're our pick for a Low Bet.

However, according to the current kinda disappointing form displayed by Dignitas in the short-term, we highly doubt we'll watch them taking home an upset over Device and co. Particularly since Astralis are stepping here after providing a long series of consistent performances across the past months, that culminated in the CounterPit Grand Final they managed to hit few days ago. Despite they ended up losing the contest, they surely confirmed themselves as one of the Top-4 EU rosters. On de_inferno Astralis have always played in pretty consistently, so they should be able to go through this game in kinda easy fashion, even if this kind of derbies can be slightly tighter than expected. However, our pick is an Avg one on Astralis.

As we already mentioned in the previous game, just like most of the T2 rosters, after a couple of months played pedal to the metal Dignitas experienced a slight drop in consistence in March. So we don't have high hopes in this kind of matchup, a game where performance peaks are required in order to stage an upset. Just like the previous contest, our pick is a Low+/Avg- one on Astralis.
http://csgo.guru/match/5453!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8793!$CLG!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.48!$0.34!$0.13999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving forward into the second round of NA EPL matches, which will actually be a rematch of an NA T1 matchup we'll have previewed earlier for the iBP semi-final. So be sure to take those results into consideration as well with this, since that game has not yet been played while doing this analysis. Much of teams' forms was discussed in their first matchup. Both of which are playing a fairly high levels currently. The level we've seen from Liquid has been the more consistent over this Qtr, where they've already qualified for a couple relevant events, while also setting up good shows with relevant results, aside from the intermittent BO1 loss. Meanwhile rise in the form of CLG has been a slightly detoured route, but in the short term, reltuC and the gang looked as though they may be turning the corner, returning to their dangerous form. Primarily evident in efforts against the two Brazilians groups this weekend. But so far, Liquid is been their recent achilles. So we'll see how the approach the multiple opportunities they'll have today to change the pattern. But Cobblestone may not be the best chance for, since CLG has has some issues on it versus high-tiered teams. Betting Odds are still moving alot, with the such an active schedule in play today, but on our end, we feel Liquid should be more solid on de_cbble, so we're going with a Low Bet on them in this first ESL game
http://csgo.guru/match/5454!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8794!$Liquid!$CLG!$Liquid!$0.52!$0.64!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second half of this EPL series,and third match of the day between CLG and Liquid. There not a great deal more to add about these two, that we haven;t already covered in their earlier contests. For this game, we'll be moving over to Mirage, which actually a little bit tricky to predict. Nearly a month, these two faced off on this, where nitr0 and the gang handed the fellow Americans a quite stunning 16-1 defeat. Granted, that what during the time CLG had yet to really begin playing to their potential. So when previewing this match, we're inclined to deem that contest irrelevant to the current matchup, since CLG didn't begin playing at high level until recently. And since then they've set up some good things on it, particularly the dominant victory 16-7 over Tempo Storm last night. Meanwhile, Liquid haven't focused much on it, and aside from the CLG win referenced above, most of their results haven't that encouraging onit. So we feel, of the two, this is game that should likely be prone to a CLG tilt, and maybe a little retribution. With that in mind, we oriented toward taking a Low Bet on CLG as our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/5459!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8762!$CW!$Penta!$CW!$0.55!$0.55!$0.0!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Overall a pretty balanced match that could be slightly closer than expected. Penta a week ago finally completed their roster with the addition of Lowel, after trying out several options following the departure of Davidp. Without any doubt this switch ringed the bell for the German mix, that finally woke up and started delivering acceptable results, even if their current level is still floating around the Tier-3 hell. On the other side, CPH Wolves are generally pretty decent, and in the short-term the Danes managed to deliver several interesting results. In particular worth mentioning the victory over E-Frag and the tight match they offered against Gamers2. Surely there are good chances to watch this contest hitting the 3rd map, but overall we're oriented in giving an edge to CPH Wolves, since we find them more consistent than Penta. However, we don't really suggest to go with values above Low.
http://csgo.guru/match/5460!$http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8775!$Ancient!$Ence!$Ancient!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Quite interesting game for this early batch of DH Malmo Qualifier matches. ENCE despite the promising roster, in the past months failed to provide consistent performances, and aside very few peaks, the Finns still have to find a proper pattern for moving ahead the Tier-3 mess. On the other hand Ancient are slowly improving, and after taking home the Pantamera Challenge trophy, kept offering decent shows in the following online matches as well. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch de_train, de_mirage and de_cbble. If the veto will take this path, Train and Mirage should be in slightly advantage of Pronax and co, while Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are still fine for a Low pick on Ancient, so we're oriented in sticking with them, since we find the Swedes more consistent on the extended map-pool.

On the other hand, Gambit are surely sporting more fire-power, and a lineup that on-paper should be capable to deliver performances on par with a good range of Tier-2/3 teams. Despite in the past months we watched several victories slipping out of their hands due some late-game inconsistency, overall they are doing decently so we're expecting Dosia and the gang taking home this match. Betting odds are still quite ok for a Low pick on Gambit, so we'll take this direction as well.

Selfless are entering into this contest after hitting an impressive series of extremely great performances, something kinda unexpected and actually really impressive. Looks like that Relyks and co. are actually peaking, and yesterday aside the stunning victory over Luminosity they also managed to keep their streak rolling by destroying Splyce in the following EPL matches. On the other hand Cloud9 in the short-term managed to wake up as well, and early in the bracket they managed to dismiss OpTiC with a convincingly 2-0 score. Prior this, Skadoodle and the gang also displayed good things versus Luminosity and Renegades, so just like Selfless also C9 are hitting this contest backed by a pretty high form. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_cache, de_train and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, Cache should be in favor of Selfless, while Cloud9 should be advantaged on Train and Inferno. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of C9, while real-world odds are more aligned to the middle in order to reflect the latest amazing shows delivered by the roaring lion. So at our end we're slightly more oriented in attempting a Low pick on Selfless in order to take advantage of the more rewarding percentages.

In fact it's a matchup we'll see several times today. This should be quite an exciting contest, considering their performances last night. CLG ended up being assigned the Brazilians derby, facing the two top teams under the flag.First they drew the up and coming Tempo Storm, who'd been basically mowing down the NA scene over recent weeks. After losing the first map, Hazed took charge, and lead them to take the following maps, and advance to this qtr-final. The following test against Luminosity was not as successful, but we are talking about one the best out there. Overall, they should be in good form to put up a decent fight, in an attempt to break the streak of losing battles vs S1mple and friends. Liquid in the other hand, have been playing mostly solid over the short term. After going 1-1 with Wfx in the EPL set, they managed to sweep TSM 2-0, but needed OT on Dust2 to reach it. Not the most scary team out there, but adreN's new assignment with TSM surely improved their potential. But as long as they keep their heads about them, despite the recent convincing wins over CLG in the recent games, koosta and co. should be able to reach the grand final. As for the maps, these two have an extensive history, and they're fairly balanced on the whole. There's a higher probability we'll de_cbble, de_train, and de_overpass. If we see these three, CLiquid should be advantaged on Overpass and Cobblestone, and CLG with an edge on Train. Betting Odds are trending in favor of Liquid, which we tend to agree, but CLG's win against the Brazilians makes a strong rebuttal. With percentages still decent for Low Bet on Liquid, then we'll go that route.

SK in particular trashed most of the good results they achieved in the first Quarter of the year, and actually they are sitting on a kinda terrible losing streak. Surely in the short-term they had to mess with quite high-end rosters, but overall they could have handled them in a slightly better way, since we're mostly referring to BO1 contests. On the other hand FlipSid3 are actually following a kinda random pattern, in the past few days they mixed peaks and valleys at alarming rate, and actually we're prone in considering them as an huge question mark. Honestly we don't really understand how a roster can end losing an extremely relevant BO3 such as the one versus Ancient, and then upsetting Mousesports twice in a row in what on-paper was a way harder match. Anyway, talking about the current BO3, we're expecting to watch: de_train, de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto will go this way, Train should be in favor of the Danes, while the Ukrainians should sport an advantage on Mirage, and Overpass can easily go either way. At our end we're slightly more oriented in attempting a Low pick on FliPSid3, since we find SK kinda unreliable, but overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch a tight match.

Well, based on the invites to the event, we can say, this wasn't quite the matchup of event favorites we expected. Of the two finalists, Cloud9 was one of the potential favorites for reaching the Final. But once the seeding was finalized, considering C9 was looking at a possible matchup with Luminosity along the way, who was the event favorite, ultimately their arrival here ended up being a bit surprising. Thanks to a surprising upset over the Brazilians by Selfless, Cloud9 did not have deal with LG, but instead received a more manageable opponent in Selfless. Earlier today, Skadoodle and friends easily and decisively handled fellow Americans, in clean convincing 2-0 sweep. This coupled with a series of high level performances over the short term, they'll arrive here in strong form for this NA Tier-1 matchup. Liquid on the other hand, have also been peaking in the short term. Despite a random BO1 fail against Wfx, they've collected a convincing run victories. After CLG managed to defeat the high-rolling Tempo Storm in the Quarter-Finals, which was kinda unexpected, they met S1mple and friends in the Semis. There Liquid kept to their effective strat approach, and aside from an OT loss on Overpass, they took the other two maps with relative ease, to close the game 2-1 and landing them here. As for this contest, we're looking at quite a balanced matchup, particularly while both teams appear to peaking simultaneously, collecting a similar run of victories. Recent contests are dated, but generally balanced, as we're currently oriented toward seeing this as a pure 50/50 matchup. Regarding maps, we've good chances to see de_cache, de_inferno, and de_cbble. If the Veto Pattern nailed this, Cache will advantage Liquid, Cobblestone will favor C9, leaving Inferno as a coin toss, but honestly all three could easily go either way. Betting Odds are trending in favor of Cloud9. Considering they've had a slightly more difficult stretch of games in the short term, we're oriented toward seeing favored here as well. Here we're expected to see tight scores and maybe even some OT. So we're keeping values Low, but our pick is Cloud9.

AGG are moving here following a pretty critical loss versus Dignitas, that killed their chances to qualify for DreamHack Malmo. However, the former Vexed roster in the short-term offered a kinda decent pattern, and managed to beat SK and Gambit, so even if lately they dropped a bit in performances they are still consistently floating within the mid-Tier2. On the other hand ENCE are still struggling to find their place in the Rankings, the Finns are actually playing in a pretty inconsistent ways since a long time, and they keep alternating decent shows with totally absurd chokes. Anyway, looks like that in the past couple of weeks they finally managed to wake up a bit, and surely they stepped-up a 'lil compared to mid-February. About maps, we're expecting to watch: de_cbble, de_mirage and de_train. If the veto will take this path, Train should be in favor of AGG, while Mirage may end in favor of the Finnish side, and Train can go either way. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, so at our end we're oriented in going for a Low pick on AGG, since we find the Poles slightly more reliable than the Finns.

During C9's run to the $10,000 prize they took home, they pretty much rolled over OpTic, Selfless, and Liquid in convincing fashion. Prior to that, Skadoodle and friends have been mostly solid, and have surely recovered from a shaky beginning of the year. NRG on the other hand, have actually been a bit of a surprise since their inception. Aside from dropping two against Astralis, they collected a decent streak of encouraging performances. Most notably their upset victory to eliminate EnvyUs from the CounterPit Finals. Despite the Frenchmen currently experiencing hard times, this was still a relevant win, So they've certainly proved their potential . Since we're talking about de_train, a map where NRG have not had the best results including a previous loss to C9 on it. While Cloud9 has been achieving consistent positives results here, so we're not expecting to see any surprises in this contest. Betting Odds are already at the 80/20 mark, but of the two, we feel the chances for an upset are less on Train, so we're oriented toward skipping this one. But since Cloud9 is our pick if we must go with a side.

However on this map, theres chances we'll see a slightly closer contest than before. Unlike de_train, Cloud9 has been less effective in executing their T-side strats. Which has kinda been there pattern over the long term. While in short term, they've a small streak of losing efforts. So despite the overall higher form of Shroud and the gang, de_cbble is map they're much more prone to poor results. Meanwhile, NRG hasn't accumulated the best series of performances on this map. But its also a map we haven't much of this lineup battle on. Although they're at a generally disadvantage, they've shown in past few weeks of games, their approach is pretty tactical. So with some smart counters, they could exploit some of those issues C9 experiencing here, wouldn't be too surprised if ptr and the crew can manage a tilt. Betting Odds here a not as steep as the first game, currently floating around 70/30 in favor of C9. So we're slightly oriented toward seeing the 2 games split in this matchup, so we're going after the more rewarding percentages, and taking a Low Bet on NRG in hopes of a decent profit,

CompLexity are rolling into this match after a couple of weeks where they basically failed most of their matches, even some that on paper were supposed to be quite manageable, such as the BO3 versus TSM. Overall their form is kinda below the average, and at our end we're kinda concerned by their current status, and we wouldn't be surprised to see roster changes coming soon. On the other hand WinterFox are quite inconsistent as well, but overall they can surely field more fire-power, and then they somehow managed to take home several extremely critical matchups against Selfless and Liquid. So we're talking about a roster that when on a good evening can surely play on par with a wide range of well ranked opponents, in particular with the BO1 format. However worth mentioning that de_dust2 is a map where Wfox in the past weeks experienced more than an issue, and overall we don't really find them as extremely reliable, and for this reason most of the Betting odds are currently trending in favor of coL. Honestly, this is going to be a pure 50/50 game, so we're slightly more oriented in playing the odds by attempting a Low pick on WinterFox, with the hope to catch the higher reward.

As we already mentioned in the previous game, both rosters faced a pretty low consistency in the short-term, and overall ended suffering a wide amount of defeats. WinterFox are surely looking a bit better compared to CompLexity, and managed to achieve slightly more as well, but honestly we're referring to two lineups that kinda lost the right path, and are mostly moving ahead without a solid plan. On Overpass we'll likely enjoy a pretty balanced contest, generally WinterFox never really provided stunning performances on this map, but few days ago they somehow managed to stun Liquid on it, something not really expected and surely promising. CompLexity on the other hand, never really offered super exciting shows as well, and according to what we watched in the past weeks they should sport less chances compared to de_dust2. Betting odds are still decent for going with WinterFox, so we'll stick one more time with a Low pick on them.

As we stated in the previous game as well, AGG are performing kinda decently, and even if they don't seem to sport the same fire-power they used to deliver in the past, they are still a pretty solid roster, generally capable to deal with T3 lineups without sweating too much. On the other hand Empire a week ago collected their first victory over an EU side by taking down CSGL, honestly this wasn't really expected. But after-all not even extremely relevant, since CSGL keep playing this kind of games with a quite disappointing attitude (just like they did versus XPC). Acting as 'super-stars' and not caring about low-tier matches (kinda absurd since they never achieved anything and are a mid/low-tier roster as well). However, generally AGG are smarter than CSGL, so we don't really expect to see huge surprises, and at our end we're oriented in sticking with a Low+ pick on them.

Over the last several months+, we've watched Luminosity steadily improve and progress all the way to the Top 5 in the world. For the most, we see them in contention for the top spot. LG's online performances however are surely a step below what they achieve on LAN. Offline they're only recent defeats are to Fnatic and NAVI. Although they're the number one NA team, we've still seen them fall to WinterFox and just the other day lost 2-1 vs Selfless eliminating them from iBP. So despite being obvious favorites here, they are more prone upsets in online competition. TSM on the other hand, are still a ways off from the upper tiers, but certainly a lineup that now shows promise, particularly with the addition of adreN to the regular roster. Considering what we watch in the short term, they're mostly aligned to the mid NA second tier. They did manage victories over compLexity and Renegades on the extended map-pool. So we wouldn't be surprised if we watched the stump the Brazilians a bit here. But honestly doubt they'll manage to grab more than a single map. As for the maps, this will be the first meeting between these lineups as currently constructed, but based on Veto pattern, theres good chances we'll watch de_overpass, de_cbble, and de_cache. And really, the Brazilians should be fairly advantaged on all of them. And so percentages are of course not really profitable for our Luminosity pick, so we'll likely pass.

Both teams are hitting this game after following a kinda inconsistent pattern during the past weeks, but surely AGG displayed way better things compared to ENCE. The Poles already faced the Finns yesterday, in their UCC BO3 game, and ended sweeping them 2-0 in a quite easy fashion, so today we're not really expecting huge surprises out of this re-match. As we stated several times already, ENCE are struggling since a quite long while, and even if lately they woke up a 'lil they are still offering shows way below their full potential. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_inferno, de_overpass and de_dust2. If the veto will take this path, AGG should have an edge on Overpass and Dust2, while the Finnish side may grab Inferno. Betting odds are already rolling in favor of the Poles, and at our end we're prone to agree since they are without any doubt sporting an higher momentum. So our pick is a Low one on AGG.

HellRaisers following the latest roster changes ended dropping the Ukrainian flag, and now aside Ange1 and Oskar the rest of the roster is now composed by a promising Slovakian trio. Surprisingly, in the short-term the fresh new HR managed to deliver quite interesting results, and so far they passed all their Tier-3 tests and overall offered performances quite on par with most of the other Tier-2 rosters. So even if the roster composition on-paper isn't really super scary, we're talking about a team that's surely capable to offer a pretty organized gameplay. On the other hand Alternate aTTaX, after starting the year with the pedal to the metal, lately slowed down their run. Despite they are still pretty fine versus low-end opponents, they started struggling a bit versus mid-tier ones, and just few days ago they also suffered a 2-0 loss versus HR. So the current form of the Germans is a bit of a question mark. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_cbble, de_overpass and de_cache. If this will be the case, Overpass should be in favor of HR, while both Cobblestone and Cache can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently way too skewed in favor of HellRaisers, and while they surely sport a decent advantage we should keep in mind that we're talking about a game where we wouldn't be surprised to see the 3rd map kicking-in. So at our end we're prone in risking a Low-/ICB pick on Alternate aTTaX with the hope to watch the Germans waking up a bit.

Additionally, yesterday they also ended losing 2-0 their CEVO game versus FlipSid3, so they aren't really entering here with their best form. On the other hand, FlipSid3 are kinda inconsistent as team, in the past weeks they woke up a bit, but overall they are always extremely prone to random chokes, and not really solid in the mid-term run. However, they surely displayed better things compared to SK, and they are also looking slightly more organized. Anyway worth mentioning that on de_mirage the Danish side always managed to show decent things, and even if their form is currently below the average, this is still one of the few maps where we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing fine. So we're prone in considering this game as a pretty balanced one, and at our end we're oriented in risking a Low pick on SK.

While things on Mirage could be kinda balanced due SK being pretty decent on it, here on Train we should watch a more streamlined game, according to the promising results that FlipSid3 achieved during the past weeks. As we stated in the previous matchup as well, SK recently started facing structural issues, and we wouldn't be surprised to see roster changes coming in their direction soon. FSid3 on the other hand are still quite random, but at least they are still floating decently within the Tier-2 mess, and overall they should be slightly ahead the Danes. Betting odds are one more time skewed in favor of FlipSid3, but this time we're oriented in sticking with the Ukrainians since we find them slightly advantaged on Train.

As happened to most of the teams currently placed in the 2nd Tier, also Mousesports and Dignitas recently dropped a bit in performances, and after a first Quarter where they mostly played on par with a good range of Tier1 rosters, now they are facing a performance drop that is making them kinda vulnerable. Overall the Germans are looking a slightly step above the Danes, and overall still managed to offer good shows against structured rosters, while Dignitas mostly took home matches versus low-tier lineups and looked quite shaky. However, on de_cbble, both teams should be pretty aligne,d and we wouldn't be surprised to see Dignitas bouncing back, since they always been pretty decent on this map. Currently, betting odds are still fine for going Low on Rubino and co. so we're oriented in taking this way.

As we already explained in the previous game, both Dignitas and Mousesports dropped a bit in performance in the short-term, and in general the whole T2 slowed a bit their run and increased the gap with the first Tier. However out of the two contenders, the Germans displayed slightly more promising things, and even if this is going to be a pure 50/50 contest, we're oriented in having more faith in them compared to Dignitas. For this game we're moving to de_inferno, a map where generally Mouz always displayed decent things, the Danes used to play it in an acceptable fashion too, but overall their level seemed below the things that the German side displayed so far. Betting odds are still quite aligned, but at our end we're oriented in going for a Low pick on Mousesports, since we find them slightly more in form in balanced maps compared to Dignitas.
http://csgo.guru/match/5496!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8827!$OG!$Selfless!$Selfless!$0.55!$0.75!$-0.19999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Moving forward into the North American schedule of the evening, where we'll get started with the first batch of EPL matches. A fairly balanced matchup for this first set of games. OpTic has been consistently inconsistent in this first quarter of the year. Most recently, after splitting a set with WinterFox, the Canadians moved on to the iBP Invitational where they faced Cloud9 in the first Quarter-Final. Despite OpTic's rather convincing win over C9 earlier in the month, things went the opposite direction as they were quickly swept and eliminated from the event. So although they surely have the potential for highlevel peaks, they're developing a pattern of coming up short when the stakes are raised. Meanwhile, Selfless (also a member of the T3 hell), have likewise followed the pattern of highs and lows. While OpTic was being eliminated, Selfless met Luminosity in another Quarter-final, where they managed to upset LG in a stunning victory. They went on to lose to C9 as well in semis, but a testament to their potential nonetheless. Overall, Relyks and co. have surely stabilized a bit after a rocky start to the year. As for this first game, we're talking about Inferno, a map Selfless hasn't really focused on, while ShahZam and friends have offered some of their better shows on it. And in the short term, its been one their better maps as well. So we're mostly aligned with the current Betting Odds rolling in favor of the Canadian-side. But right now these percentages aren't very rewarding for our OpTic pick. So we're slightly oriented in trying a Low-ICB on Selfless since we don't feel the Odds properly reflect the potential of the American side.
http://csgo.guru/match/5497!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8828!$Selfless!$OG!$Selfless!$0.45!$0.38!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for this NA EPL matchup, featuring Selfless versus OpTic, and this time we'll be moving to de_mirage. Again, we've kinda tricky contest to predict. On the whole, the Canadian side has been sporting a higher form than their American counterparts, but in the short term the two have performed at fairly similar levels. We discussed in the previous contest, the recent trends and form of the two. Mirage is map both have been active this year, both achieving kind of mixed results. And the previous meeting between the two, saw OpTic set up a pretty convincing victory over the former NME group. However, the recent run of contest for Selfless, make this matchup a bit tricky to predict. But these regular season matches without elevated stakes tend to result in better shows for Rush and co. So we're in agreement with current Betting Odds favoring the Canadians, which are still decent for a Low Bet on OpTic , so we're oriented toward taking this spath as well.
http://csgo.guru/match/5498!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8829!$Renegades!$Splyce!$Renegades!$0.52!$0.72!$-0.19999999999999996!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second batch of NA EPL matches, and bit of a random matchup between two teams who've had glimmers of promise in recent weeks but still find themselves swimming in rough waters. Renegades had a decent run early-mid march, but in the past week, they've hit a stretch of losing efforts against the NAs T1. However this first match is on de_train, a map the Aussies have generally played well. So this may offer good timing for USTILO and the gang to turn their fortunes around. SPLYCE on the other hand, have mostly only managed a small handful of relevant victories, most notably of course was qualifying for the MLG Columbus Major. Which has kinda become the only real highlight of their year. As likely mentioned before, these types of repetition results often lead to org forced changes. So for the sake of hoping for me of what we've seen glimpses of on LAN, they're gonna need to right the ship sooner than later. Train has never been a map they've found desirable results, so we've to give the Australian side the advantage here. Betting Odds are still somewhat acceptable for a Low Bet on Renegades, so we'll follow that path
http://csgo.guru/match/5499!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8830!$Splyce!$Renegades!$Renegades!$0.48!$0.2!$0.27999999999999997!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second half of this AU/US mixup matchup for the North American portion of tonight schedule, except this time we're moving over to Inferno. Although we're again not seeing much a matchup that should be of much surprise. As we discussed previously, SPLYCE has overall had a disappointing beginning of the year, aside from a few exceptions. And this time on de-inferno, we're talking about a map, Davey and co. have been able to manage any relevant or favorable results. It's a map they've actually played with higher frequency, but just haven't been able to achieve any successful strat. Even against lowend opponents, they continued to struggle here. So although they should be able to achieve better things, they've yet to do so. Renegades on the other, have also picked more in the Veto in recent months, and generally they put up decent shows on it. So once more, on paper at least, the Aussies should surely be advantaged on this map as well. What makes this a bit tricky to predict, with these back to back BO1s, there's a greater chance to chance of an unexpected upset/tilt resulting in 1-1 finishes, and this matchup certainly seems prone fall into this pattern. So we're inclined to wait a bit, and see how the first game goes. This time, percentages are floating around the same as before, so once more we're oriented toward giving the Australians the edge once more, and going with a Low Bet on Renegades.

NRG are rolling here after ruining their positive winning streak with an impressive 2-0 loss suffered versus Cloud9. After the good shows delivered during CounterPit Finals, we were expecting to see the EU/NA mix to keep their positive momentum also within the NA scene, but things didn't exactly go so, and what they displayed versus C9 was surely way below the average potential of this roster. On the other hand, WinterFox aren't really the most consistent team out there, but if they manage to hit a good evening they may turn into a a quite problematic team to shut down. In the past we watched Anger and co. delivering pretty crazy upsets, so we wouldn't be surprised to see them doing well. Additionally de_train always been one of their best maps, so we'll likely watch a pretty tight match. Betting odds are still slightly skewed in favor of NRG, but overall this is mostly a pure 50/50 matchup, and at our end we're slightly more prone in attempting a Low pick on WinterFox, mostly because of the map they're playing on.

While the first game could surely quite tight due taking place a map where WinterFox always provided interesting shows, here we should watch a game mostly in favor of NRG. The EU/NA mix generally always delivered quite solid shows on Inferno, and they also sport an fire-power generally quite aligned with the top-tier NA rosters, so we'll likely watch Ptr and co. taking home Inferno without sweating too much. Betting odds are still quite fine for going Low on NRG, so at our end we're oriented in taking this path.

HellRaisers are moving here after dismissing Alternate aTTaX in a pretty easy fashion, and overall the Slovakian mix is surely looking pretty on-point despite the kinda messy roster. On the other hand Ancient managed to hit a really impressive streak, and after about a month where they provided kinda inconsistent results, Pronax and co. finally managed to step-up, and actually they are delivering shows pretty aligned to the mid Tier-2 level. About maps, we'll likely watch de_overpass, de_cbble and de_inferno. If the veto will go this way, the Swedes should have an edge on Inferno, while HR may grab Cobblestone, and Overpass can easily go either ways. At our end we're oriented in giving an edge to Ancient since we find their current momentum quite strong, and additionally they also looked extremely on-point in their previous BO3s. However we don't suggest to go with values above Low.
http://csgo.guru/match/5504!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8826!$TStorm!$CLG!$CLG!$0.52!$0.62!$-0.09999999999999998!$LOW RISK!$LOW BET!$Aside from the series of EPL games we've on the schedule this evening, we do have what should be the best game of the night. The Cevo Gfinity Pro 9th Season semi-final will feature the extended map-pool for the NA Tier-1 matchup. One of the hottest trending teams of the year Tempo Storm established their spot in the discussion of hot teams after a solid start to the year, and more recently their LAN performance in Katowice, where they were barely eliminated by [NatusVincere]. But just this past weekend, in the discussion as possible candidate to reach the finals in the iBP, the Brazilians failed to escape the qtr-finals, after being eliminated by CLG. Considering the form of lucas and the gang in the short term, this result was kinda unexpected.So theres still some consistency aspects to stabnilize for the yound Brazilians, but remain a bunch to watch out for. CLG on the other hand, has been much of a question mark. They surely sport firepower with high ceiling, and have managed several runs of solid outings, but continue to be prone to random fails. Prior to their decisive victory over the Brazilians this weekend, they had a mixed bag of results amongst mid-low tiered teams. But come into this game after a couple disappointing shows against Luminosity and Liquid, both of whom are just above CLG in the NA ranks. So we're basically looking at mostly a pure 50/50 matchup. As far as the maps go in this BO3, theres good chances we'll watch: de_cbble, de_train, and de_dust2. Assuming the Veto follow this path, the Brazilians will have the edge on Cobblestone, CLG will be advantaged on Train, leaving Dust2 which could easily go either way. Betting Odds are currently trending in favor of Tempo to return the favor following the weekend loss. On our end, we're inclined to agree, and doubt CLG will be able take consecutive BO3s from the Brazil-side. Ultimately setting the stage for an all-Brazilians derby for the Cevo Grand Final. While percentages are still decent for Low Bet on Tempo Storm, we'll follow this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/5518!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8842!$FSid3!$Fnatic!$Fnatic!$0.35!$0.11!$0.24!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Time to move to the first batch of ESL Pro League matches, that will warm us up before moving to the big clash between NiP and Astralis. Overall, this should pretty much be a one-way game, FlipSid3 are floating pretty fine within Tier-2, but honestly they don't really sport enough fire-power or class to compete with Fnatic. So even if Overpass is surely a map where we might watch scores closer than expected, and while the Ukrainians have always played it decently, we highly doubt we'll see Fnatic moving ahead with a loss in the bag. Particularly because over the short-term the Swedes never really struggled versus mid-tier opponents, aside from the OT loss they suffered versus mousesports on de_dust2 (but well, D2 shouldn't be used as relevant metric). However, betting odds are already trashed in favor of Fnatic, and as usual, betting on a game featuring 90/10 percentages is pretty much pointless due to the extremely low-reward. But well, if for some reason you don't want to skip, our pick is Fnatic.
http://csgo.guru/match/5519!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8843!$Fnatic!$FSid3!$Fnatic!$0.7!$0.9!$-0.20000000000000007!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Second match in a row for both rosters, and here we're moving to de_inferno, a map where the risk of surprises is way lower compared to de_overpass we reviewed before. As we mentioned in the previous match as well, Fnatic are currently the team to beat, as the roster leading our World Ranking. So obviously they are widely favored to take home this game. FlipSid3 aren't doing too bad, but overall their level isn't really comparable with the one that most of the T1 teams are sporting, in particular when we talk about games taking place on classic maps. Just like before, Betting odds are again widely skewed in favor of JW and friends, and since we're talking about percentages edging the 90/10, you can either skip the whole thing or stick with Fnatic (for basically no reward).
http://csgo.guru/match/5520!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8839!$Penta!$Gambit!$Gambit!$0.48!$0.43!$0.04999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Not an easy match to predict. These rosters are two of the more inconsistent of the whole scene. Penta woke up slightly after the roster changes, but overall, we're still talking about a team who in the mid-term ended up losing about 85% of their matches. Even those versus rsther sub-par lineups, so we're always pretty concerned when we review their games. However, its worth mentioning that since they switched Davidp with loWel things started rolling a bit better for the German organization. On the other hand, Gambit are sporting one of the best lineups of the CIS scene, but they're still struggling in taking home relevant results, even versus teams that are sporting fire-power way below what the Russian mix is fielding. Honestly, they seem to be affected by the 'FaZe disease', that can be summed up in: great potential but recurrent sup-par performances. Anyways, for this BO3, we're expecting to watch de_cache, de_cbble and de_overpass. If the veto goes this way, Gambit may have an edge on Cache, while Cobblestone may end in favor of Penta, and Overpass is going to be pretty random. Betting odds are still pretty balanced, and we wouldn't be surprised to see the 3rd map kicking-in. However at our end we're oriented in giving an edge to the CIS side, so our pick is a Low Bet on Gambit, since we find them slightly above the level of the Germans.
http://csgo.guru/match/5521!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8840!$Astralis!$NiP!$NiP!$0.52!$0.63!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Last series of EU ESL Pro League matches, and here we're finally moving to the batch of matches we've all been waiting for. In the short-term, both these top-tier rosters managed to do pretty well. NiP surely failed to display proper results at most of the offline events they've attended. But if we look to the other side of the medal, they are actually the team who provided the most consistent performances in EPL, and actually they're sitting on quite a great streak of online victories. However, its worth mentioning that in EPL, Astralis followed quite a similar pattern, and the Danes are actually sitting at the top of their Group, with 13 victories and just 3 losses. Additionally Device and friends have also provided quite a good set of LAN performances. Despite their level still being a tiny bit below the one sported by Fnatic and Natus Vincere, they are without a doubt one of the most solid European sides. Mirage isn't really an easy map to predict, since both sides experienced a long streak of peaks and valleys on it. And overall this has never been one of their favorite picks. However, according to what we watched so far, we're oriented in giving to Astralis a little bit more of an edge, since they've played it slightly more convincingly. Betting odds are actually pretty much nonsense. As stated above, the Danes should be advantaged but honestly not as much as currently displayed by most of the betting providers. Overall, we're talking about a T1 match that can easily go either way, so at our end we're oriented toward risking a Low pick on NiP, in order to take advantage of the skewed percentages.

Just like the previous game, this just another contest that is extremely hard to predict, particularly since Cache has always been a map both rosters used to play decently in the short-term. NiP in particular, have lately stepped up a lot, and even managed to beat Fnatic and Virtus.Pro, two teams that have always provided consistent shows on this map. On the other hand, Astralis replied with a similar pattern, but its worth noting that overall, in the short-term they haven't really focused on Cache too much. So their level on this map could be slightly below that of NiP. Betting odds are rolling in favor of the Swedes, and as explained above this is kinda correct, so despite us finding the current percentages kinda nonsense, we're oriented in sticking with a Low pick on NiP, with the hope to watch them continuing their series of good showings on this map.

Theres not too much say about the Canadian/US mix of ex-AGG, who are currently playing under the name of 'KKona'. After this group moved from SKDC to AGG, failed to achieve any relevant results, or really any wins at all for that matter. After the org decided the replace the full roster by signing the former lineup of Vexed, but not before the getting their spot in this 3rd Esl season. To this point, their fortunes have not changed, the continue to find themselves in a losing effort. Meanwhile on the other side, we've the current top team of the NA scene, Luminosity, who aside from a single BO3 loss to Selfless have been mostly dominant in their online matches, and have tangoed on par with the best on LAN. So this isn't a matchup where we're expecting anything surprising. Betting Odds are already trashed in favor of the Brazilian side. And since we're talking about a T1 team versus a challenger/T3, we're not going to have rewarding percentages. So with Luminosity as our pick, we'll likely just skip.
http://csgo.guru/match/5525!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8856!$LG!$KKona!$LG!$0.7!$0.87!$-0.17000000000000004!$LOW RISK!$AVG BET!$Second match in row for this EPL matchup, and again not anticipating anything expected from this mixed tiered contest. This time we're moving over to de_mirage, which isn't map the Brazilians really focused on, but generally alway managed decent results. Despite the random stumble we saw yesterday versus TSM, which really isn't that relevant since they tried a few new things on the CT-side that gave a promising TSM squad the opportunity to steal the map. But otherwise, their results haven't offered much room for potential upset from the struggling Canadians who sit multiple levels below Coldzera and friends. KKona (ex-AGG) on the other hand, only had one successful outing on Mirage but it was a below T3 contest. And in the few other visits on it, against T3 teams, the barely reached double digits never really even threatening in match. Honestly, there's not much else to add about this group. Kudos on the effort for sure, overall encouraging moments are of such infrequency, they're not find it easy finding new sponsorship. So til they offer up some decent shows, we highly doubt they do much to slow the Brazilians. Again, the Betting Odds are already garbage, and basically pointless for our Luminosity pick. So once more, we're oriented toward skipping this as well. But if you gotta pick a side, LG is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/5526!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8850!$Cloud9!$WinterFox!$Cloud9!$0.55!$0.85!$-0.29999999999999993!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Moving forward into our final contests of the evening, and the last batch of NA EPL matches. Over the last few weeks, we've seen Cloud9 really come to form as they've strung together a rather impressive series of winning performances. The level we're currently seeing from the group closely resembles the level of the roster we watched most of last year, prior to Stewie2K being added as a starting regular. But since the inconsistent start of the year, they've finally pulled together a solid team chemistry that surely paying dividends. In addition to their LAN qualifiers, they most recently took home the top prize in the iBP Invite. SO their current track record speaks for itself, and Dust2 is map they've usually preferred, while stacking mainly positive results on it. Winterfox on the other hand, is mostly stuck in the mud of the T3 mess. Although they've surely managed to offer up some better shows in the short term, and even a couple surprising victories, they continue to struggle in making this level of performance a constant effort. As a result, they continue collected very sporadic results failing to gain any momentum from game to game. Despite Dust2 being map of some attention, they've failed to put their firepower on display against relevant opponents on it. And for that reason, we highly doubt they'll to end C9's streak in this contest. But percentages are already at the 85/15, so we're inclined to skip, but if we're to pick a side, Cloud9 is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/5527!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8851!$WinterFox!$Cloud9!$Cloud9!$0.45!$0.15!$0.30000000000000004!$HIGH RISK!$ICB BET!$Final match of the night, and second half of this NA EPL matchup between WinterFox and Cloud9, except this game we'll move to de_train. In first contest, we discussed the challenge of stability the continues to plague the efforts of Wfx. However, in the past two weeks, Anger and co. have shown some promising signs of improvement. In contests where they expected to be disadvantaged, they've impressed with some impressive showings, including map victories over Luminosity, Liquid, and OpTic. So their potential makes a still a danger to most of the NA. Additionally Train is actually a map they've managed some of their better shows, making this game their best hope of the two. Cloud9 on the other hand, is arguably one of the hottest team in NA. Aside from losing a random map, they're riding a decent winning, and their most relevant of the year. With this level of streak, they've surely looked decent and favored across the map-pool. Although they've achieved the desired end result, Train has been a map they've looked slightly vulnerable on, having some difficulties closing out. But they still have the advantage here. Again, the current Betting Odds are heavily favoring C9, which we agree with considering the recent level of play. Since the percentages offer little profit, and since Wfx chances are best on this second map for an upset, we risk a ICB on WinterFox in hopes of seeing them break their pattern.

Worth mentioning that a couple of days ago SKYTTEN left Orgless, and Slap filled the VACancy. Honestly this is a quite huge switch, and Skytten was one of the players that made this mixed EU roster so promising, so at our end we're oriented in considering this change as a relevant step down. However, Orgless are currently on a quite decent winning streak, and even without SKYTTEN they should be able to move over Method without huge issues. On the other hand the Russian side are continuing their streak of fails versus European sides, and lately they turned quite inconsistent within the Russian scene as well, so even if BO1s are generally quite risky, we don't really believe we'll watch them bouncing back soon. Betting odds are still acceptable for an Avg pick on Orgless, so we're oriented in taking this path.

E-Frag are rolling here following a pretty good streak. The Bulgarian side in the past few weeks has managed to battle on par with most of the other Tier-2 rosters. And overall they looked pretty solid, even if still slightly below the peak they offered during mid-January. On the other hand, YP is following a pattern fairly similar to the Method, and basically they never really managed to turn into a serious threat for the European rosters. But at least they looked quite decent within the Russian scene, something that Method mostly failed to achieve. Since we're talking about a plain BO1, we can't really roll out the possibility of an upset, but based on what YP displayed in the short-term, we find it pretty unlikely. Betting odds are still decent for going Low+/Avg- on E-Frag, so at our end we'll just stick with the Bulgarians.

As we discussed yesterday, Selfless has been a team of many peaks and valleys, but some of the peaks they're achieving continually get higher over time, as the American bunch keep managing to set up some pretty impressive outings. The win over Luminosity remains the most notable, but again last night they put up a couple of rather solid performances, where they successfully took back to back maps from a typically dangerous OpTic roster. Since NRG rose from the ashes of the former Method squad, they've managed to put together a more stable EU/NA lineup,which so far has been mostly aligned as a Tier-2 team. Aside from a few losses against some of Top Tier, such as Astralis and Luminosity, they've so far proven to be a legitimate NA contender. They'll come into the evening's games following a pair of solid wins of WinterFox, taking both EPL contests. So overall, we're looking a pretty balanced matchup. As for this match, we're in the Cevo Qtr-finals of the 2nd NA bracket where the winner will secure a spot in the Gfinity LAN Finals. The winner of this BO3 will advance to the semis to face LG, which will in turn determine the other grand-final contender vs CLG. So the stakes are certainly raised due to the new Cevo format. Regarding the maps, theres good chances we'll watch: de_cache, de_mirage, and de_inferno. Should we see these picks come out of the Veto, Selfless will have an edge on Inferno, NRG slightly advantaged on Mirage, and Cache could easily go either way. Betting Odds are currently skewed slightly in favor of relyks and the gang. On our end, we agree in seeing them a bit more reliable on the extended map-pool. yet , while we're expecting a pretty even fight where close scores and possible OT will be needed, we're a bit more oriented toward playing the percentages, and going with a Low Bet on NRG for the more profitable reward.
http://csgo.guru/match/5534!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8848!$AGG!$ATN!$AGG!$0.55!$0.67!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$Second match in a row for AGG, and here the Poles are facing ALTERNATE aTTaX in the GO:CL Quarter-Final, so we're talking about a quite relevant game. As we already mentioned in the previous contest as well, Hyper and co. had a couple of slightly inconsistent weeks, where they moved from beating SK and playing on par with Dignitas, to losing versus Empire. As we explained before, this is a common issue for the Polish side, but on-paper shouldn't really play any role in the current matchup. On the other hand, ALTERNATE aTTaX are facing quite hard times, after an extremely promising February where they managed to offer performances aligned to the mid-Tier2, the Germans didn't manage to keep their momentum, and during most of this month they experienced a kinda random mix of peaks and valleys, without being able to offer serious fights against teams above Tier-3. Talking about this game, we're expecting to watch de_overpass, de_train and de_cbble. A set of maps that should be in clear favor of the Poles (with the exclusion of Cobblestone). Betting odds are still fine for a Low+/Avg- pick on AGG, and at our end we're oriented in sticking with them since we believe that the veto will end in their favor.
http://csgo.guru/match/5535!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8857!$Orgless!$AGG!$Orgless!$0.42!$0.3!$0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$First match of the day, and overall a quite interesting T2 contest and a fairly balanced show. Orgless despite the departure of SKYTTEN managed to keep their positive streak rolling, and yesterday they took down Method without sweating too much. However, worth mentioning that the Russian side wasn't an extremely relevant opponent, in particular according to the kinda poor performances displayed versus most of the European sides, and against AGG things will be surely more complex. On the other hand, the Poles are moving here after a week where they mostly collected mixed results From a side they looked pretty consistent versus most of the mid-tier teams they faced, but from the other we're kinda concerned by overlooks such as their loss versus Empire. Honestly this is a frequent pattern for AGG, and an issue they're carrying over since their Vexed times. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_cbble, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will take this path, AGG should've an edge on Overpass, while Orgless should be able to grab Cobblestone, and Mirage is mostly 50/50. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on AGG, so we're oriented in sticking with the Poles, since we find them slightly more balanced as team.

As we already mentioned, Orgless had to deal with roster changes early this week and they swapped Skytten with Slap, a switch that may lead to a slightly performance drop in the mid-term (but won't change much in the immediate future). On the other hand CSGL stepped up quite a lot in the short-term, even if mostly in mid-tier games, while they kept following a quite absurd pattern versus low-tier rosters. This caused the Poles to offer consistent shows versus teams such as Ancient and Dignitas, but also kinda weird defeats versus Empire and XPC. About maps, we're expecting to watch de_mirage, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, Train should be in favor of Orgless, while on both Overpass and Mirage CSGL may have an edge. Betting odds are currently a bit too skewed in favor of the Poles, and despite they surely sport an advantage we find the current percentages quite suitable for an ICB on Orgless, so we're oriented in taking this path.

HellRaisers are moving here after a pretty good run in the bracket, even if we can't really say that they had to sweat too much in order to reach this game, and the only serious opponent they had to face was Preparation, while the others were dismissed in kinda easy fashion. On the other hand Publiclir.se are experiencing a pretty stunning weekend, they rolled through the BYOC Qualifier and then messed with a not really easy Group Stage where they had to deal with ENCE and SK. Somehow the Swedish mix managed to move forward and impressively also ended beating CPH Wolves with a 2-0 sweep in the Quarter-Final. So overall FEJTZ and co. are doing really fine, and in this game we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking home a map. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on HellRaisers, so we're oriented in sticking with them since they surely sport an wider LAN experience and they are also favored for winning the whole event.

Space Soldiers stunned most of us by managing to take down SK in the Quarter-Finals, surely a promising victory, but to be honest, lately the Danes aren't really delivering their very best, and during the past month they looked kinda inconsistent and shaky. However, still kudos to Xantares and co. for their run, which is without any doubt quite great, in particular if we consider that they had to climb through the hell of the BYOC Qualifier. However E-Frag looked pretty solid so far, and aside a BO1 loss versus CPH Wolves, they managed to deal pretty well with both Epsilon and Dignitas, so even if we might watch the Turkish side taking home a map, we're oriented in believing that the Bulgarians will move on to the Grand-Final. Betting odds are still decent for a Low+ pick on E-Frag, so we'll just stick with them.
http://csgo.guru/match/5632!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8885!$HR!$E-Frag!$HR!$0.52!$0.64!$-0.12!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$After a couple of upsets in the Quarters that made the Semi-Finals a fairly easy walk for both E-Frag and HellRaisers, we're finally moving ahead into the last stage of the always enjoyable Copenhagen Games. As we mentioned in the Semis as well, HR are rolling into this match following a good streak of victories. But it is worth noting that they were sitting in a relatively easy side of the bracket. Aside from the game against Preparation, they managed to move through it without sweating too much. On the other hand, E-Frag followed quite a similar pattern, suffering just a single loss versus CPH Wolves. But overall, they've surely faced more obstacles along their road here, with both Dignitas and Epsilon being pretty tough sides to mess with. Talking about the current match, we're expecting to watch de_overpass, de_dust2 and de_inferno. If the veto will go this way, Inferno should be in favor of HellRaisers, while Overpass may go to E-Frag and Dust2 is mostly a pure 50/50 contest. Betting odds are currently a bit too skewed in favor of the Slovakian side, while honestly we're expecting a pretty balanced matchup. So at our end, we're slightly more prone toward attempting a Low pick on E-Frag in order to attempt catching a higher reward.

Surely the BO1 format may lead to scores slightly closer than usual, but the new veto-system used for this event should give a little hand to the favored teams, reducing a bit the BO1 randomness. As we already discussed, NiP are fielding Threat for this event instead of Pyth, due last-minute visa issues. This is going to be a pretty relevant blow for the Swedes since after several kinda disappointing months with Pyth they finally managed to find the perfect balancing, and their hopes for this event were pretty high. Worth mentioning that Threat is still a pretty fine player, and also a quite brilliant coach, so we don't believe we'll see NiP facing issues prior Playoffs. FlipSid3 aren't really a super scary opponent, and even if lately they improved a bit, they still displayed kinda shaky shows on several maps, so the new veto may lead to a difficult map for the Ukrainian side. At our end we believe we'll watch Train, and if it'll go so NiP should be fairly advantaged. Betting odds are still fine for a Low+ pick on the Swedes, so at our end we're oriented in taking this path.

Mousesports may be considered as an underdog, but actually the Germans are one of the most deadly teams in BO1 games, and they didn't take down teams such as Fnatic by chance. Even if surely the Germans aren't favored for moving forward to Playoffs, we wouldn't be surprised to watch ChrisJ and the gang nailing at least a major upset prior the BO3 deciders. On the other hand Luminosity are without any doubt the team that in the short-term improved the most, the Brazilian side is currently sitting in the top-3 of our World-Ranking and during this first Quarter of the year managed to deliver quite stunning shows versus most of the T1 teams around. Worth noting that lately they slowed a bit their run, and their latest online games went in a slightly disappointing way, but overall they generally step-up in LAN matches, so we're not too concerned by a couple of fails in local NA matches. At our end we believe we'll watch de_overpass or de_train as maps, and in both cases Mouz should be able to offer a decent resistance, so according to the current pretty skewed Betting Odds, we're slightly more oriented in attempting an ICB on Mousesports.
http://csgo.guru/match/5635!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8912!$FaZe!$Liquid!$Liquid!$0.52!$0.63!$-0.10999999999999999!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$MLG Columbus is getting intense with one of the most interesting contests of the day. Both FaZe and Liquid have to battle pretty hard in order to grab the 2nd spot available in Group B (since Fnatic will very likely fill the top one), and on paper both rosters are looking pretty aligned in performances, so we're expecting to see tight scores and maybe an OT as well. Liquid had a rough start of the year, and the two roster changes triggered in the first months of 2016 made the roster a bit unstable in the short-term, however lately they finally managed to setup something decent, and overall they looked pretty aligned to the level displayed by Cloud9. Worth mentioning that for this event Hiko and friends are using adreN instead of Koosta due the roster rules for this Major. Honestly this is not going to be an huge blow, but will surely decrease a bit the Liquid firepower. On the other hand FaZe aren't really flying too high too, the EU mix failed to catch any relevant result during the first Quarter, and their current situation is a quite risky one, and we wouldn't be surprised to see roster changes triggering in case of just another poor show. Maikelele and co. always been a slightly step below the T1 rosters, and the BO1 format may cause them some headaches, in particular against NA sides. Betting odds are trending in favor of FaZe, but this is mostly a pure 50/50 contest, so at our end we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low pick on Liquid, with the hope to catch a decent reward.
http://csgo.guru/match/5636!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8913!$Fnatic!$Splyce!$Fnatic!$0.6!$0.94!$-0.33999999999999997!$MEDIUM RISK!$AVG BET!$Honestly we're not expecting huge fireworks from this match, and as we already mentioned Fnatic aren't just favored for winning this contest, but also for advancing to Playoffs in first place, something that shouldn't be an huge issue according to the lack of T1 lineups in this group aside the Swedes. SPLYCE surely stunned many (us included) when they managed to qualify for the Major, prior that peak they mostly delivered kinda average results, so we were expecting to see [Vexed] taking that spot. However, CS:GO is beautiful because unpredictable, so we truly hope to watch Arya and friends doing fine, even if they are actually the side with the least chances to move on. Not much else to add, Fnatic should be able to move forward without issues and obviously betting odds are already trashed in their favor, so since we're talking about 95/5 percentages we highly suggest to skip the whole match (and eventually take a break) due the low profitability.

Without a doubt, one of the event favorites Natus Vincere, who come into the week after shortly following their triumph in Croatia, where they grabbed the trophy for the CounterPit S2 Finals after defeating Astralis in the Grand-Final. In their prior LAN appearance, the CIS-side had a less favorable run in the event at Katowice, where they exposed some less seen vulnerabilities. But this is a group packed potential, where somebody will be sent home earlier than expected, hence the 'Group of Death'. Cloud9 on the other hand, are arguably one of the hottest trending team in the North American scene currently. After seemingly coming to life in the Main Qualifier for this event back in February, the Americans have assembled quite an impressive collection of shows throughout March. Besides securing a spot in DH Austin, their high note so far, is surely their victory at the iBP Invitational, supporting their claim as one of the top teams out the NA. So we wouldn't be too surprised to watch Skadoodle and friends manage to upset the expected sequence of events through the group, possibly beginning with this entry match. As for this contest, this will actually be the first meeting between the two since mid-2015. Its worth noting, that the Guardian and co. have been somewhat prone to slow starts in offline events, making this bout that much more balanced. Particularly when considering the recent success and form that C9 has achieved. Betting Odds are actually moving around still, while real-world odds are much more even at 55/45 in favor of NAVI. We've to give the advantage to them as well, so on our end, despite our expectations of watching C9 be a huge test for Guardian and friends, we're still oriented toward seeing them a more reliable with higher stakes, so our pick is a Low Bet on Natus Vincere. But if the percentages breach 80/20 where this pick would be of little reward, then we'd consider risking an ICB on C9.
http://csgo.guru/match/5638!$https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8917!$VP!$G2!$VP!$0.52!$0.45!$0.07!$HIGH RISK!$LOW BET!$We're closing the first day in Columbus with a pretty amazing matchup. As we already mentioned in our preview article, the letter D in 'Group D' basically means Death. With 4 high-end teams packed into a single group we're not expecting less that an amazing set of matches, and this game looks like one you cannot miss. Virtus.Pro have been on a really terrible run so far, the Polish giants suffered more than expected the extra-long Xmas break, and when they moved back in biz, they found themselves several steps behind the rest of Tier-1 rosters, with pretty few chances to move back on the right track prior the long series of big events that went live during the first months of the year. However, the Poles in the short-term finally started looking a bit revitalized, and even if they are still quite below their usual level, here at the Major they should be able to offer shows on par with the bottom-end of the First Tier. On the other hand Gamers2 are one of the EU teams that improved the most, after a pretty disappointing year with Titan, the French/Belgian roster finally managed to find their dimension and started delivering quite good shows. Overall they look pretty on-point in BO1 matches, and we wouldn't be surprised to watch them taking down VP. However they are still a bit off in complex games featuring Overtimes and messy rounds, so even if they are doing well, they still have several weak points compared to the top-trending rosters. Betting odds are still fairly balanced, so at our end we're oriented in going Low on Gamers2 since we find them slightly more reliable than VP.
