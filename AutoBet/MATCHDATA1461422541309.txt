http://csgo.guru/match/2|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5697|Dignitas|Imm|Dignitas|0.6|0.89|-0.29000000000000004|MEDIUM RISK|ICB BET|Here we've a bit more interesting and (on the paper) balanced game, compared to the previous (Group A) one. Immunity (Tier3, Form: 51.7) obviously are a bit of a question mark, since they can't face Euro teams on a consistent basis due their location. However in their previous shows they always provided performances in line with the Tier3, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a decent fight against Dignitas, even if the chances of watching them taking the whole Bo3 are quite low. On the ther hand Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) are obviously favored, they are part of the four top-ranked Tier2 teams looking for a Tier1 spot, and even if lately they stepped back a bit they are still pretty capable to deal with most of the T2-3 teams around. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Dignitas, and even if we agree on this trend, unfortunately the percentages are quite terrible and nowhere profitable. So we're a bit more oriented in attempting a #yolo ICB on Immunity just in order to add some pepper into the salad (but the chances for it to pay off are pretty low).
http://csgo.guru/match/3|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7022|SKDC|WinterFox|WinterFox|0.5|0.36|0.14|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|As we get ready for DreamHack Winter, we do have one match of note on the schedule for tonight. Kind of an interesting low-end matchup for a best of three StarSeries contest. SKDC certainly isn't one the more relevant low teired teams, but gained some exposure during the RGN Pro Series. But more importantly they gained some much needed experience battling some of the more established and notable teams of the scene. However they didn't perform too well in their recent relevant matches, and are surely a good ways off from competing with the upper T3+ teams, but considering some of the recent bumps we've seen from their NA opponents here, we could see this game go to third map. The recent bumps of Winterfox just mentioned, were largely evident during their brief appearance at RGN. Granted, it was one of the very first events for the currently composed Wfx roster, but honestly we expected a little bit more from them than what they brought. Especially after a respectable entry game victory over Torqued. But since that win, Wfx's struggles have been on full display, even in their last online match vs 3sUP. So this should make for a good opponent for them to try and rebuild some confidence. Since these two teams, as currently composed, have no real match history to reference the veto will likely be driven by whichever maps both teams played well together in practice. So theres no basis to guess the final selection. Ordinarily we'd expect Wfx to be able to grab by a possible 2-0 sweep, but their recent troubles will likely see them lose at least one map, and even a chance to blow the contest all together, putting real-world odds at a 50/50 toss-up. But on our end, we believe the raw team skill of Wfx should be able to prevail, so our pick is a Low bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/4|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8433|mouz|NiP|mouz|0.55|0.32|0.23000000000000004|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Day One in Poland for the 2016 IEM Katowice, sporting an impressive roster of teams battling it out over the next four days, and we begin with the Round-Robin Group Stage. The first of the opening matches for this BO1 hell, features a pretty interesting matchup between Mousesports and NiP. Mouz has a had a decent start to the year, playing pretty consistently at a high T2 level, and have certainly made a strong case as a T1 prospect. At APM Finals, we watched the Germans dominate the field without losing a single map. So theres no question regarding their LAN capabilities, though here they'll surely have a more difficult path to travel, beginning with the Swedes who managed to to edge them out, twice, online last week for EPL. NiP on the other hand, have actually been one of the least active T1 teams of this first Quarter. However, to some surprise, the downtime seems to have had little to no affect, on their effectiveness and executions. But this will be their first LAN appearance of the year, so we wouldn't be too surprised to see them going through a small period of adjustment moving offline. Overall, F0rest and friends are good form entering the week, backed by a series of encouraging results. Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Swedes, which is correct, especially since they've already topped the Germans in their first two meeting this year. But Real-World Odds are way closer to even than the percentages we're seeing right now. Although they manged to wins those contests, but by the slimmest of margins, including some OT. On our end, we're inclined to pick the Swedes as well. But if the percentages reach 75/25, we're oriented toward trying our luck with an ICB on Mousesports, in hopes they take advantage of some NiP LAN rust for their entry game.

Little time, so getting right to it. LG was top seed and awarded a bye through the first round. So this is their first game today. They're coming off a mediocre performance with Cloud9, where the two split the EPL set. But Overall, the Brazilians at right at the top near the Swedes, so they're surely a level above shakier American-side. Selfless on the other hand,had to work their way into this match, by sweeping WinterFox 2-0. But they had to sweat for the 2nd map, but managed to end it quickly. Overall, Relyks and co. don't quite sport the firepower to match the Brazilian-side, so we doubt they'll manage more than a single map with the extended map-pool in play. So our pick is Low Bet Luminosity, or just skip since the percentages aren't really rewarding enough.
http://csgo.guru/match/6|https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8926|CSGL|ATN|CSGL|0.55|0.71|-0.15999999999999992|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Not too much about this Operation Kinguin matchup. CSGL has recently shown some signs of stability, as they've managed to add two event dates to their calander. The Poles in the past months have seem to regain some consistency they've been in absence of, generally, for quite some time. And in March alone, they successful managed to secure their tickets for both DH Malmo, and just the other day adding DH Austin as well. And bring with them today, actually a decent winning streak and set of positive peformances. Meanwhile ALTERNATE aTTaX has really fall in a hard times recetly, in contrast to the Polish-side have collected a stretch of dispappointing outings. While CSGL was grabbing theor spot in DH, the Germans failed to even threaten in the closed qualifiy. And as for this matchup, they may likely manage to puch the contetst to a third map, but overall, we doubt they manage to upset the Poles while running on their current peak. So on our end, we're in agreement with percentages trendoing in favor of the Poles, so on our end, we're oriented in going with a Low Bet on CSGL, with expectation of watching them continue perform at a level on par with much of the Tier-2.
http://csgo.guru/match/7|https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9140|mouz|Godsent|Godsent|0.52|0.68|-0.16000000000000003|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Third match of the DreamHack Masters Malmo Quarter-Finals, and here we're expecting to watch a fairly balanced matchup. GodSent started their journey suffering a 16-11 defeat versus Natus Vincere, mostly triggered due to a far too risky map pick. However they quickly moved back on track and surprisingly managed to reach playoffs following victories over CLG and Gamers2.Ttwo matches that were far from easy, particularly for a newly formed roster. Anyway this event surely shed some light on the very high potential of this roster, and we'll likely watch them doing pretty well in the future too. On the other hand, Mousesports are actually the team showing the best things within the 2nd Tier. In the short-term, the German mix looked extremely consistent and have become a serious threat to Tier-1 rosters as well. Here in Malmo they hit the top of their Group, and forced others to the Deciders, such as Luminosity and Liquid, so ChrisJ and his gang are surely peaking right now and offering performances way above their average. Its worth mentioning that we now have moved to the BO3 format we might watch them slowing down their run a bit. About maps, we'll likely watch de_cbble, de_cache and de_train. If the Veto will take this way, Cache should be in favor of Mouz, while Train may go to GodSent and Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Mousesports, and this is correct since the Germans should sport a more complete knowledge on the extended map-pool compared to Pronax and friends. At our end we're prone in sticking with Mousesports as well, but honestly this is going to be a quite even game and we wouldn't be surprised to watch OTs and close scores.

http://csgo.guru/match/15|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5112|CLG|Liquid|CLG|0.6|0.78|-0.18000000000000005|MEDIUM RISK|AVG BET|This is the first NA we cover in several months, as many of you are already aware of, we took a pause from the NA scene in June due the never-ending-shuffle that kept mixing the cards twice a week. Actually the current situation seems a bit more stable, so it's time to provide again some love to NA games. Talking about the current match, both teams never shone on the International soil, but locally they are pretty fine, since most of the NA teams share the same meta, with just C9 (and partially, ex-LG) standing out from the bunch. Usually CLG are a bit more consistent than Liquid, in particular on the extended map-pool, however we need to note that Hiko is currently standing-in (he's on a trial) for Liquid, and this may help a bit, even if his form isn't extremely high (61/100 according to our Ranking) or comparable to the first Quarter of the year. About maps, as displayed in our Veto Pattern graph, de_dust2, de_overpass, de_mirage and de_train are all pretty popular picks, and there are good chances to watch all of them if the match will last more than a Bo3. If it goes so, D2 and Mirage (here the edge is pretty low) should be in favor of CLG, while Overpass and Train are usually pretty random and can easily go both ways. Anyway, the default 1-0 is a pretty big advantage, and we doubt we'll watch CLG wasting it, or losing two Bo3s in a row, so, even if CSGL odds are currently pretty bad, we're oriented in picking an Avg bet on CLG.
http://csgo.guru/match/16|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5293|mouz|Kinguin|Kinguin|0.5|0.4|0.09999999999999998|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Today we'll enjoy the last series of PGL 'Last Chance' matches, just like yesterday these games are chained, so we'll start with the current one, then we'll move forward to NaVi vs (winner of Mouz/Kinguin), and we'll end with the Group Final (played as Bo3) between TSM and the winner of the NaVi-Mouz/King match-up. This game and the following one will be played as Bo1, so as usual we'll enjoy a quite unpredictable fight, mostly decided by the veto-session together with some luck, rather than accurate planning. However we're sure that this will be a quite exciting game to watch. Both teams are currently rolling pretty fine, and looks like that Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) finally managed to re-acquire some self-confidence. Yesterday they managed to beat Dignitas with a clean 16-13 on Mirage and they ended the day with a 2-1 victory over Fsid3 in the FaceIT Qualifier Final, so we're sure they'll move here with a quite high motivation. On the other hand Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) are the hottest Tier2 team of the past two weeks, and looks like they're a step above Dignitas (they tilt frequently) and HR (they're inconsistent as hell). Additionally they already managed to take down Titan plenty of times in the short-term and they're the favorite candidate for switching with them in the Tier1 Olympus. Talking about the current match, current CSGL odds are skewed in favor of Kinguin mostly because two factors, the first one is the huge amount of Kinguin supporters scattered around the globe, but the 2nd is the previous Head to Head that these team had in early August during the PGL Qualifier, where Kinguin managed to take the Bo5 Final with a clean 3-0 score (Mouz later managed to Qualify via an 'Emergency Qualifier' happened as result of the EnvyUs's withdrawn). However we suggest to don't give too much importance to this result, since we're talking about a match happened in mid-summer and about a month ago. About the map, this time there are multiple possibilities since both teams share a kinda similar pattern, so the most likely options are de_mirage, de_train and de_overpass, but at our end we trend towards Mirage. If this will be the case, Mouz may have a little edge, but overall we're talking about a pure 50/50 game. Betting Odds are globally trending in favor of Kinguin, but as we stated above we really believe we'll enjoy a balanced game, so our pick is a Low bet on Mousesports.

However this is for sure a nice match-up, and probably the best one so far. Ukraine is fielding a mix between NaVi and HR players (S1mple just joined HR), with Bondik (actually the most consistent Fsid3 player, ranked #21 as Rifler, Form: 67.5) as icing on the cake. France is replying with a core composed by current/former EnvyUs players (Shox, Apex, Kennys, Happy) together with Rpk, who lately stepped up a lot. For sure the French lineup is extremely interesting, since most of these players are used to play together since a long time, and even if lately the shuffle mixed them, they still work well together. On the other hand, The Ukrainian roster looks a bit experimental, S1mple isn't playing seriously since he moved out from Fsid3, and he still has to play his first game with the HR shirt. Zeus and Edward are for sure a couple of solid picks, while Ange1 is a bit like Rpk, he started slow but currently he's doing quite fine. Betting odds are trending in favor of France, and this is understandable due the Envy-core, but honestly we're talking about a Bo1, so real-world odds are just in the middle and the match can easily go both ways, in particular if we'll watch a new map. Our pick is a Low bet on Ukraine in order to take advantage of the skewed odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/19|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5640|ES|EnVyUs|EnVyUs|0.25|0.07|0.18|LOW RISK|HIGH BET|Not much to say about this match-up. EnvyUs are clearly several steps ahead of EzSkins, and for sure this will be an extremely difficult match for the British side. Recently Envy hasn't performed too great against the rest of T1 teams, but in this case they should be able to take a victory in a pretty easy fashion. Betting odds are naturally super-skewed in favor of Envy and not profitable at all, so you can just skip this game without regrets (or go High on Envy if you enjoy winning Bizons).

Immunity (Tier3, Form: 51.7) obviously are a bit of a question mark, since they can't face Euro teams on a consistent basis due their location. However in their previous shows they always provided performances in line with the Tier3, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a decent fight against Dignitas, even if the chances of watching them taking the whole Bo3 are quite low. On the ther hand Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) are obviously favored, they are part of the four top-ranked Tier2 teams looking for a Tier1 spot, and even if lately they stepped back a bit they are still pretty capable to deal with most of the T2-3 teams around. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Dignitas, and even if we agree on this trend, unfortunately the percentages are quite terrible and nowhere profitable.

Russia is moving here with the same lineup they sported in the previous game against United Kingdom, so overall looking at a pretty fine roster. On the other hand Germany is fielding players coming from three teams. Its quite an interesting mix of youngsters and experienced players, (such as Spiidi and Tabsen) so we're inclined to expect they'll jump in the game with quite an aggressive playstyle. That said, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a game closer than initially expected. Additionally, since this is a Bo1 format, (DE will likely push for a *new* map during the veto). Honestly, Russia is the better team, but we still actually feel this game pretty risky and certainly unpredictable due the composition of the German roster, so even thuough our pick is a Low+ bet on Russia, we do suggest caution with the values.

Since we're talking about a CEVO Bo2, good chances are they can easily end in a draw. Method are for sure not the most consistent team out there, but we at least need to give them credit on the fact that they never give up and just keep fighting. They continue slowly improving, which is for sure a good and promising thing. 3sUp performances on the other hand are quite random. They moreso resemble a pickup team, rather than a permanent team, and its been while since they've enjoyed pleasure of victory. Honestly there is plenty of room for a Tie, but since we need to choose a side, Method are certainly looking a bit more focused, and doubt we'll watch them lose twice, especially if they manage to pick de_mirage or de_dust2.

E-Frag lately started playing in a quite inconsistent way, and their form is nowhere near the one they displayed during mid-summer when they were running really hot. In the short-term they failed to achieve anything relevant, they lost against a wide range of T2 and T3 teams, and actually they are edging demotion to Tier3. On the other hand FlipSid3 are currently sporting a really amazing teamplay, for sure they lack a bit of raw firepower since with the exclusion of Bondik the rest of the roster is composed by pretty average players, but after-all the results are what matter and this lineup in the short-term improved a lot and they are actually solidly placed within the Tier2. For sure the Bo2 format used by CEVO may trigger a Draw, but for sure Fsid3 are the advantaged side, and the ones that in this game have more chance to take a 2-0 victory; so our pick is an Average bet on them.

Here we've a CEVO Bo2, and honestly this is a quite balanced match, both teams have highs and lows on pretty different set of maps, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch the game ending in a Tie. In particular if they'll go for Mirage and Cbble. Betting odds are currently in favor of Titan, but honestly we don't believe they deserve more than just a 5% edge over Mouz, since we're mostly talking about a pure 50/50 game. At our end we are a bit more prone in attempting a Low bet on Mouz, in order to take advantage of the pretty off odds.
http://csgo.guru/match/27|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=6492|LG|Na'Vi|Na'Vi|0.45|0.39|0.06|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|And so we end today's Quarter-finals with what should be a pretty exciting matchup. The first seed coming out of Group A, Luminosity, took the hard road here. In the both of their first two matches, they had an uphill battle to climb as the underdog, but managed victorious over higher ranked opponenents in Cloud9 and Fnatic. LG began Cluj determined and prepared, having already moved to EU more than a week in advance in preparation for this DH lan event, and so far their commitment has paid dividends. So they're coming into this match rested after enjoy the winners' bye, but certainly brimming with confidence following the first two rounds. Natus Vincere on the other hand, didn't have the most difficult of a path to these qtr-finals, but did have to survive a decider match, to beat CLG for a 2nd time, after pushing past them the first time in their entry game. However, Navi was forced to the decider match after falling to EnVyUs in a humbling 16-9 loss on Day 2. Unfortunately, that loss exposed many weak points in Navi's game, so we're interested to see how intelligently LG manages that resource. But we need to note, Navi is undoubtedly the more experienced of the two, particluarly on lan. So the deeper this goes into the bo3, the more that may play in their favor. As for maps, we expect to we'll see de_Mirage, de_Cobble, and de_Dust2. If this is how it plays out, Navi should have a bit of an advantage on Mirage, while Dust2 and Cobblestone are mostly 50/50. So this for sure has all the ingredients for quite a potentially exciting finish to today's activity. Considering the impressive roll LG is on currently, on our end, we're oriented towards taking advantage of the percentages, so our pick is the slightly more rewarding Low bet on Luminosity.

Today we'll likely enjoy something really similar, and SK could be able to take their revenge as well, according to how well they performed yesterday and to their recent pretty promising results. On the other hand, nothing really new to say about FlipSid3, their firepower isn't crazy high but they compensate with a smart way to play and good strats, so usually they always manage to offer good fights against T2/3 teams. About maps, there are good chances to watch de_cbble, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, Fsid3 should be slightly advantaged on Cobblestone while both Train and Overpass are mostly 50/50. Betting odds are a bit too skewed in favor of Bondik and friends, while real-world ones are more in the middle, so at our end we're oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on SK, with the hope to watch them playing as good as yesterday.

Cloud9, as expected, has absolutely no issues in advancing to the round. Coming into this event directly from the winners' circle after winning IBP Cup, C9 didnt skip a beat as they rolled through the first round of competition. In the their 3 Group B matches, Skadoodle and friends conceded a mere FIVE round between all three games combined. Even with the inferior opponents, this is very impressive. So they drew the Group C runner-up. Games Academy is below teir 3, and not a team we've covered prior to this event. So our point of reference is as limited as C9's. The Brazilians did show some good things against SKDC and then again in their somewhat surprising victory over CSGL. But honestly, neither of those are a measuring stick for what LG can offer. Betting odds are overwhelmingly in in favor of Cloud9, which of course is to be expected. This honestly isn't even a fair matchup, and with the percentages being a heavy as they are, this must be an automatic skip, and save your skins for the next round. But naturally, feel free to bet on C9 if you gotta pick.

Kind of an interesting low-end matchup for a best of three StarSeries contest. SKDC certainly isn't one the more relevant low teired teams, but gained some exposure during the RGN Pro Series. But more importantly they gained some much needed experience battling some of the more established and notable teams of the scene. However they didn't perform too well in their recent relevant matches, and are surely a good ways off from competing with the upper T3+ teams, but considering some of the recent bumps we've seen from their NA opponents here, we could see this game go to third map. The recent bumps of Winterfox just mentioned, were largely evident during their brief appearance at RGN. Granted, it was one of the very first events for the currently composed Wfx roster, but honestly we expected a little bit more from them than what they brought. Especially after a respectable entry game victory over Torqued. But since that win, Wfx's struggles have been on full display, even in their last online match vs 3sUP. So this should make for a good opponent for them to try and rebuild some confidence. Since these two teams, as currently composed, have no real match history to reference the veto will likely be driven by whichever maps both teams played well together in practice. So theres no basis to guess the final selection. Ordinarily we'd expect Wfx to be able to grab by a possible 2-0 sweep, but their recent troubles will likely see them lose at least one map, and even a chance to blow the contest all together, putting real-world odds at a 50/50 toss-up. But on our end, we believe the raw team skill of Wfx should be able to prevail, so our pick is a Low bet on them.

Overall they looked a bit revitalized, for sure a bit fresher compared to their latest kinda disappointing shows. So we can say that they are on the good path for regaining their momentum. On the other hand Natus Vincere had to work slightly harder in order to take home a victory over Luminosity. GuardiaN and friends managed to grab de_dust2 pretty smoothly, but they experienced more issues with Inferno, where the Brazilians managed to hit the Overtime. Anyway the OT featured a NaVi dominance and closed pretty quickly. This is basically a pure 50/50 game, we wouldn't be surprised to watch the 3rd map kicking-in or even require OTs. Both teams are fully capable of grabbing a victory, so we're talking about the riskiest game of the today's batch. About maps, we believe we'll watch : de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto goes so, both teams faced these maps plenty of times and they are all pretty balanced. However, former TSM should have a little edge on Dust2, while Overpass should be in favor of NaVi. Train can easily go both ways. Betting odds are still sitting in the middle, but at our end we're oriented in gambling on the return of Dupreeh and friends, so our pick is a Low bet on ex-TSM.

WinterFox is actually playing with more consistency than we've seen from them over the past few months. Recently their spot for ESEA S3 was in jeopardy, but Desi and co. pulled it together to retain their seat with a win over the challenging Denial. And then they faced off with today's opponent in their Group A Gameshow GSC contest, in pursuit of claiming 1 of the 2 spots for the NA region for the $200K Lan event in February, where Wfx managed a decisive 2-0 sweep. They continued their streak in another GSC match (vesus a subT3 team) to remain at the top of their Group. Not that it was the most relevant match, but the important aspect is Wfx has continued playing with some level of consistency, which as mentioned, has been one of their greatest issues in recent weeks. So this match should be a good measuring stick of that progress. SPLYCE on the other hand, has made a push recently to splash their way into the relevant side of the NA scene. There looked to be some possibility of progressing in that direction, following an impressive sweep of CLG in the Road to Vegas qualifier. However, NME ended that quickly in the Semis. Meanwhile, SPLYCE also had an opportuniy to earn a spot in the Season 3 of ESEA, but a struggling Method squad wasn't prepared to give up their spot, and SPLYCE was even able to grab 1 map. So overall, the once hopeful potential of SPLYCE has lost momentum, and remains T3, and they've additionally parted ways Stewie2k, so they'll be playing with a standin today. With regards to todays match, this is CounterPit, so the usual nonsense Bo2 format applies. There's limited data to reference, but there's good chances of seeing de_cbble and de_cache. But honestly, considering the above mentioned variables pertitnent to these teams currently, Wfx should be able keep their progress going and grab the win here today. Even worst case scenario, we'll see a tie. So our pick is in line with Current Betting Odds, for a Low bet on WinterFox.
http://csgo.guru/match/34|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7700|FSid3|Vexed|Vexed|0.55|0.58|-0.029999999999999916|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Not an easy match to predict, considering both teams started the new year with a not-so-exciting bag of mixed results. Plus we currently find them both playing kinda inconsistent and not too reliable. However, this is a Bo2 match, and generally when two teams with similar issues meet, we typically see an outcome of a plain Tie. Anyway, about Vexed, we just want to remember that they generally step-up a bit when facing decent opponents, so we wouldn't be surprised to see the Polish side playing properly. Even though they aren't really solid on the extended map-pool yet. On the other hand, FlipSid3 are surely a step ahead skill-wise. But lately their gameplay is overly messy, and not really as sharp as they used to be in the past Quarters. Basically, without DavCost, their executions have turned a bit slow and predictable, when they previously had a good set of maps where they were able to setup quite great fights. Betting odds are slightly skewed in favor of Fsid3, but still decent for going Low on them, so we're oriented in sticking with Markeloff and friends for our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/35|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7892|CPH.W|FSid3|CPH.W|0.4|0.27|0.13|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Quite relevant match, since the winner will move ahead in the IEM Katowice Qualifier, and later today will battle for a spot with the winner of the 2nd Semi-Final. FlipSid3 lately are on a quite impressive streak, their form is pretty high and they are one of the mid-tier teams that displayed the most interesting things in the short-term. They somehow managed to workaround the departure of DavCost, and actually they started playing in a simple but kinda effective way. On the other hand CPH Wolves are just the old Unu.AiN roster, surely an interesting one since Hunden and the gang never performed too bad, however they don't really field an huge firepower, and most of their focus is just on smart and quick plays. Overall, we wouldn't be surprised to watch CPHW taking a map, but on the extended map-pool FlipSid3 should be a good step ahead, so they're our pick for a Low+/Avg- bet. Worth noting that the current Betting Odds aren't really great, so we suggest to wait a bit and eventually skip if they drop below 18/82.
http://csgo.guru/match/36|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8012|Cloud9|G2|G2|0.48|0.37|0.10999999999999999|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Second day in Vilnius, Lithuania for the GEC Finals, and today we'll start by covering the Group-B opening match (we skipped the next one because there isn't any consistent data about Method yet.), This is not an easy one to predict and overall a kinda risky game. There isn't much to say about Cloud9. Over the short-term, the North American side didn't really play on a regular basis, and even less on the International field. Additionally this is their first LAN event with Stewie2K instead of SeanG@res. Overall we've serious concerns about their current form, and about their capability to deal with the rest of the Tier-1 teams without invested time with proper training (they didn't play a lot during most of the Winter season). Basically they're a pretty big question mark, so at the momeny we don't really find them to be a reliable choice. On the other hand, Gamers2 are the former [Titan] squad, who've always been quite an inconsistent team. Despite their roster, which features several really talented players, they never really managed to provide any solid shows over time, and typically they're prone to experiencing somewhat random peaks, directly followed by some terrible lows, so predicting how they'll play today is surely not an easy task at all. However, it is worth noting that they've managed to find a new home, so they might express themselves a bit better than during their most recent troubled month with Titan, so we have hopes slightly higher than usual. As for the maps, our opinion is we'll watch: de_cbble, de_dust2 and de_overpass. Should the veto go this way, both Dust2 and Overpass can easily go either way, while Cobblestone should be in favor of G2. Betting odds are still fairly balanced, and this is correct since we're talking about a match filled by question marks. But honestly we don't really find C9 a reliable pick due to the low number of official matches played as currently constructed. So we're a bit more oriented in going Low on Gamers2, hoping to see them freshly inspired and a bit more in form than in their latest exits.
http://csgo.guru/match/37|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8138|LG|Liquid|LG|0.55|0.66|-0.10999999999999999|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Second batch of NA EPL matches, and now we're messing with Liquid and Luminosity, on what looks like the most interesting contest of the today's NA schedule. Liquid are moving here after an extremely disappointing show against the CompLexity's new roster. Hiko and friends failed to deliver a proper show, and most of what they managed to put up was kinda pug-like, and pretty far from what we were expecting. Just like VP in Europe, Liquid are mostly paying the price for the lack of training during the winter season. But to their credit, they did manage to comeback on Dust to even up the series. On de_overpass they've always been pretty decent, but as stated above, we've serious concerns about their current form. Additionally we can't say that Luminosity are a 'forgiving' team. The Brazilians actually are one of the teams that performed better in this first part of the year. Aside from being pretty consistent on the extended map-pool, they are also sporting rather high form. Additionally, on this map they have taken down teams such as Astralis, so theres no question they know what they're doing right now. Betting odds are trending in favor of Luminosity, and this is correct since they should have a clear edge, so we're oriented towards going for Low+ bet on them as well, since right now we find them way more reliable than Liquid.
http://csgo.guru/match/38|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8198|Ence|Orgless|null|0.52|0.64|-0.12|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|2nd match of the day, with some more Counter Pit action, and again we have a fairly balanced contest featuring two pretty interesting teams. As we've discussed before, ENCE is a roster packed with some potential firepower. Although the Finnish lineup has struggled to find their rhythm and chemistry to string together wins in contests they surely have talent to win. As a result, we've instead watched a series of mixed results that likely threatens the future of the team. But they are entering this match following an improved performance against DenDD that earns the Finns a spot in CEVO S9. Now they just need to start doing this with more regularity. Meanwhile the former PixelFire lineup, playing currently as Orgless while searching for a new Org, demonstrated their potential during the PGL Minor last month. February by contrast hasn't been as promising, as they've mostly lost all their matches. However they are entering this match following their best game of the month, by way of a 2-0 sweep of CPH Wolves. Though we're encouraged by this, they need to show some consistency before we gain confidence in them. Betting Odds are rolling in favor of the Finns, which correct considering their firepower and (slightly) better recent results. On our end we're inclined to agree, but this is a format prone to draws which we've good chances of seeing. Though this may be closer than expected, percentages are still rewarding enough for Low Bet on ENCE so we'll follow that path.
http://csgo.guru/match/39|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8283|Dignitas|Vexed|Dignitas|0.55|0.86|-0.30999999999999994|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Day 2 continues forward, as we move into the 14th match of Esl Barcelona. We just saw Astralis defeat NV, and keeping with the Danish alliance, they elected fellow countrymen Dignitas to square off with Vexed, in hopes of keeping the Danish teams in the best position for success in this tournament. As saw just two matches ago, the LAN success we've seen from Dignitas over the last several weeks is still going strong, but they were unable to close out the game against Fnatic, who forced the Danes into OT. But the relevancy here, is the competitive form RUBINO and friends are currently displaying. And now, thanks to the Astralis victory, they've been given the best chance for a win, having to face the Poles for their next battle. Vexed on the other hand, as we've discussed have been quite a mixed bag in recent weeks. In their entry game of this event, already faced the Danes for a disappointing show, in a contest the Polish-side never really threatened. Following a quick win over x6, they fell for the second time vs Gamers2. So they're now facing elimination for the first time this weekend. Current Betting Odds are already trashed in favor of the Danish. And based off what they've achieved on LAN in recent events, we're in agreement with strong chances here. Although, 85/15 to overly favored. Regardless, we are also confident with what they've done, so with these percentages we're oriented towards skipping this match, since we doubt Vexed can manage to stop the momentum of the Danes. But if you must pick a side, Dignitas is our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/40|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8433|mouz|NiP|mouz|0.55|0.32|0.23000000000000004|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Day One in Poland for the 2016 IEM Katowice, sporting an impressive roster of teams battling it out over the next four days, and we begin with the Round-Robin Group Stage. The first of the opening matches for this BO1 hell, features a pretty interesting matchup between Mousesports and NiP. Mouz has a had a decent start to the year, playing pretty consistently at a high T2 level, and have certainly made a strong case as a T1 prospect. At APM Finals, we watched the Germans dominate the field without losing a single map. So theres no question regarding their LAN capabilities, though here they'll surely have a more difficult path to travel, beginning with the Swedes who managed to to edge them out, twice, online last week for EPL. NiP on the other hand, have actually been one of the least active T1 teams of this first Quarter. However, to some surprise, the downtime seems to have had little to no affect, on their effectiveness and executions. But this will be their first LAN appearance of the year, so we wouldn't be too surprised to see them going through a small period of adjustment moving offline. Overall, F0rest and friends are good form entering the week, backed by a series of encouraging results. Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Swedes, which is correct, especially since they've already topped the Germans in their first two meeting this year. But Real-World Odds are way closer to even than the percentages we're seeing right now. Although they manged to wins those contests, but by the slimmest of margins, including some OT. On our end, we're inclined to pick the Swedes as well. But if the percentages reach 75/25, we're oriented toward trying our luck with an ICB on Mousesports, in hopes they take advantage of some NiP LAN rust for their entry game.
http://csgo.guru/match/41|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8484|LG|Na'Vi|LG|0.48|0.63|-0.15000000000000002|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Incredibly fascinating matchup awaiting us here in the first Semi-Final of IEM Katowice 2016, featuring two of the top teams in the World out of the EU and NA scenes. Coming into the event, we knew Group-A held some surprises, considering the dynamic mix of elite talent within. Amongst this mix Luminosity have been top NA representative to have gradually forced their way into the top the pack, and over the past quarter+, they've developed a high level consistency needed to go deep in these championship tournaments. Being grouped with teams such as Natus Vincere and Fnatic (arguably 'the' two best in the world) and even NiP, the Brazilians weren't quite expected to take the top seed, or even reach the Quarters for that matter. However, FalleN and the gang, had no doubts of their own, going 4-1 through the Group Stage to grab the lone Semi-Final spot. Mostly impressively, they managed to grab consecutive wins over NAVI and Fnatic, and again look to be in full form for the trophy run. Meanwhile, Natus Vincere already grabbed two trophies this year, as favorites in these events dating back to last Summer. Although they managed to arrive in this Semi, the road here has surely been less convincing than Brazilian side. Mid way through group stage, they were on the outside looking in. But took advantage of their superiority, winning the final 3 maps their spot. Before the semis, they drew Tempo Storm in the Qtrs. The Brazilian group, kinda the little brother to LG, sporting extremely similar playstyles and practice routines. Despite the obvious advantage GuardiaN and friends held over Tempo Storm, many of the mistakes we saw from NaVi on Day 1, continued today, and had to climb back from a 13-8 3rd map deficit after seemingly having full control after Overpass. So currently we've serious concerns about the CIS-side against LG. We're not alone with these concerns, as current Betting Odds are trending in favor of LG. Percentages we really haven't seen before with NaVi on the other side. But we need to remember, much like the Swedes, NAVI tends to look a bit reserved in the early stages, but typically bring out the best as the stakes are raised. And here we also have a bit of history between these two at this level, so 3 maps and possible OT would't be at all surprising. Regarding the Maps, there's good chances we'll watch: de_mirage, de_train, and de_inferno. Provided we see these maps come out of the Veto, LG should be slightly favored on Train, NaVi advantaged on Inferno, leaving Mirage which could easily go either way. So we're pretty much looking at a pure 50/50 matchup, with RW Odds slightly edged in favor of NAVI, largely due to the success on the grand stage. On our end, we're wondering if this is finally the one LG can top. And at this point, there form looks to be the more solid of two, especially after watching what TStorm managed vs NAVI already today. So we're going to follow the trend and go with a Low Bet on Luminosity, in hopes of seeing them reach the Grand Final.

After a disappointing showing during the heart of Katowice, E-frag managed a couple of decent performances in the GameShow Invitational and GO:CL. Most notably was an Overtime victory of a struggling SK squad. Overall they’re in decent form coming into the weekend, but looking at the talent-pool for the event, we doubt they’ll offer any surprises past the Quarter-Finals. CPH Wolves on the other hand, have shown glimpses of potential, but they remain a level below much of 3rd Tier. They managed couple of solid efforts, earning them draws with ENCE and Vexed in mid-February. So they’ve surely shown the they’re capable of threatening the Bulgarians, but highly doubt they’ll manage to take more than a single map in the BO3. Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of the Bulgarian-side, which is correct when comparing the current levels of the two. On our end, we surely feel E-frag should take the match, and percentages are still rewarding for Low Bet, so we’ll follow this path.
http://csgo.guru/match/44|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8715|VP|Na'Vi|Na'Vi|0.45|0.25|0.2|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Day Two in Split, Croatia for the CounterPit Season 2 Finals, beginning with the first Semi-Final featuring matchup of teams expected to have advanced through the opening round. For their entry game, Virtus.Pro met the Oceanic qualifier Immunity which pretty much went as expected. The Poles didn't have to sweat much, finishing with a mostly dominant performance on Inferno, so it's still hard to know what to expect from them. A handful of wins in an otherwise disappointing first Quarter, they haven't really delivered anything reliable. Yet we've still seen a few flashes of the of the more threatening days, so the CIS-side knows they can't sleep on them. Natus Vincere on the other hand, surely had a more challenging task with FlipSid3 that needed all three maps to determine who was going home. But as usual, GuardiaN took the reigns and ensured NAVI would make it to the Semis. Overall, despite NAVI having not quite won as convincingly as they have in the past, and have needed to work harder, yet still getting the desired results. And are surely amongst the top 4 teams in the world. However, some of their missteps could pose an opportunity for PashaBiceps and the gang to exploit. Honestly though, we doubt NAVI will surrender more than one map to Poles. As for the maps, there good chances we'll watch de_overpass, de_mirage, and de_inferno after the Veto. If this ends up the pattern, NAVI will have small edge on Inferno, Mirage will favor VP, and Overpass could go both ways. Betting Odds are currently rolling in favor of NAVI, who held a pretty decisive edge in their past meetings. However, what the Brazilians managed against the CIS in Katowice surely exposed some vulnerabilities, and we may likely again watch a match closer than expected. But we still feel NAVI is the more reliable pick, so we're going with a Low Bet on Natus Vincere.
http://csgo.guru/match/47|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8741|Na'Vi|Astralis|Na'Vi|0.48|0.41|0.07|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Time to mess with the Counter Pit Grand-Final! In our event preview we clearly mentioned that there were extremely high chances to watch both Astralis and Natus Vincere reaching the final stage of this LAN, so at our end we're not really surprised about how the quarters/semis went (aside the upset pulled by NRG). However, Astralis are rolling into this game following a regular growth in form happened during the past months, the Danish lineup started the year kinda slowly but in the following months and in particular during the last 3 weeks, they started pushing the pedal to the metal, filling the gap from the top-3 leading teams. Here in Croatia, they managed to deliver two perfect matches, even if worth mentioning that due the NRG upset they ended into a quite 'easy' side of the bracket, while surely NAVI had to sweat way more in order to dismiss the well-ranked rosters they had to face. So yes, Astralis are surely looking really good so far, but this is going to be a pretty hard match, so don't expect to see Device and co. having an easy afternoon. On the other hand, as we mentioned above as well, Natus Vincere had to deal with a kinda messy road to the Final, they kicked-off the Quarter with a messy all-Ukrainian derby, always a tricky one, and they continued with the face-off versus VP, the Poles lately displayed promising things, even if they are still kinda out of form. At our end we're prone in believing that NAVI experienced their highest peak prior IEM Katowice, and lately their form dropped a bit, even if still quite aligned with the rest of the trending Tier-1 teams. About maps, we'll likely watch: de_dust2, de_overpass and de_mirage. If the veto will trend towards this direction, we'll enjoy a mostly balanced match, with Astralis slightly more favored on Overpass, and NAVI on Mirage, leaving Dust2 as a kinda risky middle ground. At our end, we're prone in giving the strongest momentum to the Danes, and betting odds are actually following the same direction as well. Percentages are still fine for going Low on Astralis, so this is our pick. But overall we're mostly talking about a match that can easy go either way.
http://csgo.guru/match/48|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8740|TStorm|Renegades|TStorm|0.55|0.65|-0.09999999999999998|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|After a relaxing day mainly focused just on Croatia for the CounterPit Finals, we've one notable match on our North American schedule to look forward to this evening. With the 2nd NA Bracket for the 9th Season of CEVO underway, we move into the Quarter-Finals, for a pretty exciting matchup between the Brazilians and the Australians. We discussed in great length the level achieved in a short time by Tempo Storm, whose surge through the NA ranks began under the Games Academy banner, never slowing along the way. Most recently, Lucas and friends proved they were 'for-real' in Katowice, where they finished 2nd in their group to reach the playoffs. In the Quarters, they nearly eliminated one the world's top teams, Natus Vincere. Although the Brazilians fell 3 rounds short of reaching the Semis, what they managed against NAVI was nothing short of impressive. This performance, combined with over 2 months of mostly dominant efforts against the NA, demonstrated the threat they pose to the international scene. Meanwhile, Renegades hasn't had an active till these last few weeks. During which time, they've some mixed results, but aside from a select few of the NA's top teams, the Aussies have also been a team to watch out for. They walked over WinterFox with relative ease to reach this Quarter-Final, but we honestly don't think they'll be able to handle the Brazil-side through the extended map-pool, considering their struggles against the likes of Cloud9, Liquid, and OpTic. As for this match, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_inferno, and de_train. Assuming the Veto follows this path, Cache should favor the Aussies, Inferno will favor the Brazilians, and train could go both ways. Current Betting odds are trending in favor of Tempo, which we have to agree on, since they've been playing solid for some time now. Although we wouldn't be surprised to watch this go all three maps. Percentages are still rewarding for Low Bet on Tempo Storm, so they're our pick.
http://csgo.guru/match/49|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8735|Renegades|TSM|TSM|0.58|0.8|-0.22000000000000008|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|We're kicking-off the day with the entry game of the iBP Invitational, the recurrent iBUYPOWER North American cup that this time is sporting a $16,000 prizepool. Honestly, here we're not reviewing a really super-amazing match. The TSM roster recently passed through some lineup changes, and AdreN stepped in to fill the shoes of Vice. On paper, this should be a switch pointing towards the right direction, even if we're still talking about a team mostly lacking raw firepower, rather than brain. However, its worth noting that the North American side faced a serious lack of decent results during the whole first Quarter. And only in the past few days they started looking a tiny bit revitalized. On the other hand, Renegades aren't doing too bad. They started the month in a pretty good fashion, hitting a good streak of positive results in ESL Pro League, but lately they dropped the ball a bit, and ended up facing troubles in facing the top-trending teams of the NA scene. About maps, we're expecting to watch de_mirage, de_train and de_cbble, and if the veto will go this way, we're oriented in giving an edge to the Aussies, since they should be slightly more reliable on the extended map-pool compared to TSM. Betting odds are still decent for going with a Low pick on Renegades, so we'll stick with them.
http://csgo.guru/match/53|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8736|LG|Selfless|Selfless|0.58|0.92|-0.3400000000000001|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Moving forward in the IBP Invitational Quarter-Final, between Selfless and Luminosity. Little time, so getting right to it. LG was top seed and awarded a bye through the first round. So this is their first game today. They're coming off a mediocre performance with Cloud9, where the two split the EPL set. But Overall, the Brazilians at right at the top near the Swedes, so they're surely a level above shakier American-side. Selfless on the other hand,had to work their way into this match, by sweeping WinterFox 2-0. But they had to sweat for the 2nd map, but managed to end it quickly. Overall, Relyks and co. don't quite sport the firepower to match the Brazilian-side, so we doubt they'll manage more than a single map with the extended map-pool in play. So our pick is Low Bet Luminosity, or just skip since the percentages aren't really rewarding enough.
http://csgo.guru/match/54|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8739|Liquid|TSM|Liquid|0.55|0.78|-0.22999999999999998|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Before we wrote of the last iBP match today, but in fact we overlooked the this Quarter-Final also scheduled for tonight. Here we've actually a pretty interesting matchup, that may be much closer than expected. Liquid have come to form over the mid-term, setting up performances aligned with the NA Tier-1. However, their most recent matches with OpTic and Renegades were bigger tests for the Americans, resulting in a close 2-1 loss to the Canadians, and settling for 1-1 with the Aussies. Considering the fairly recent changes to the lineup, we're not surprised to see them having some issues in highend matches, but they don't seem to leveled off yet. Meanwhile, as we mentioned earlier, TSM recently added adreN to the lineup, which was sure to add some firepower, but what they managed earlier against the Australians in the entry round, what better than we anticipated. Despite their string in inconsistent results since joining the Org, they managed one of their best efforts to date, landing them a spot in this Quarter-Final. A tricky element to this matchup, is the TSM's new 5th man, who is not only familiar with Liquid's Strats, but he's also on their starting roster for the MLG Major. Surely, he can offer invaluable insights to properly counter his teammates on the other side. As for this match, despite the X-factor of adreN, we still to give the advantage to Liquid. As for the Veto, we've no match history to refer to, based on their histories, theres good chances we'll watch de_cache, de_cbble, and de_overpass. Although Liquid should have the edge through the extended map-pol, when viewing what TSM achieved against the Aussies, their best chances will be on Cobblestone and Overpass. Betting Odds are currently skewed in favor of Liquid, which is to be expected with TSM's lineup having little history together. On our end, we wouldn't be surprised to see close scores and maybe a third map. So we're gonna wait to see how Liquid plays their other games before this one, but unless they unravel in those contests, we feel they're the more reliable pick. So we're going with a Low Bet on Liquid.
http://csgo.guru/match/55|https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8831|NRG|WinterFox|NRG|0.58|0.6|-0.020000000000000018|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Third batch of North American EPL matches, and here we're reviewing a game that may lead to surprises. NRG are rolling here after ruining their positive winning streak with an impressive 2-0 loss suffered versus Cloud9. After the good shows delivered during CounterPit Finals, we were expecting to see the EU/NA mix to keep their positive momentum also within the NA scene, but things didn't exactly go so, and what they displayed versus C9 was surely way below the average potential of this roster. On the other hand, WinterFox aren't really the most consistent team out there, but if they manage to hit a good evening they may turn into a a quite problematic team to shut down. In the past we watched Anger and co. delivering pretty crazy upsets, so we wouldn't be surprised to see them doing well. Additionally de_train always been one of their best maps, so we'll likely watch a pretty tight match. Betting odds are still slightly skewed in favor of NRG, but overall this is mostly a pure 50/50 matchup, and at our end we're slightly more prone in attempting a Low pick on WinterFox, mostly because of the map they're playing on.
http://csgo.guru/match/67|https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8926|CSGL|ATN|CSGL|0.55|0.71|-0.15999999999999992|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Not too much about this Operation Kinguin matchup. CSGL has recently shown some signs of stability, as they've managed to add two event dates to their calander. The Poles in the past months have seem to regain some consistency they've been in absence of, generally, for quite some time. And in March alone, they successful managed to secure their tickets for both DH Malmo, and just the other day adding DH Austin as well. And bring with them today, actually a decent winning streak and set of positive peformances. Meanwhile ALTERNATE aTTaX has really fall in a hard times recetly, in contrast to the Polish-side have collected a stretch of dispappointing outings. While CSGL was grabbing theor spot in DH, the Germans failed to even threaten in the closed qualifiy. And as for this matchup, they may likely manage to puch the contetst to a third map, but overall, we doubt they manage to upset the Poles while running on their current peak. So on our end, we're in agreement with percentages trendoing in favor of the Poles, so on our end, we're oriented in going with a Low Bet on CSGL, with expectation of watching them continue perform at a level on par with much of the Tier-2.

FlipSid3 are actually sitting on a pretty terrible losing streak, and honestly we were expecting them to perform a bit better versus Dignitas, however worth mentioning that in the short-term the Ukrainians mostly faced top-tier rosters, and even at MLG Columbus (despite the early elimination) they managed to put up extremely promising fights, threatening both NiP and Mousesports in risky Overtimes. So we don't think they'll face relevant issues in dismissing Method. On the other hand, the Russian side still have to setup a viable set of strats for messing with the European sides, and in the past weeks they failed to provide performances on par with the Tier-3, so their current chances of offering a serious fight versus Markeloff and friends are pretty limited. Betting odds are already trashed in favor of FlipSid3, and dropping a bet here is not going to be profitable at all, so you should evaluate a plain skip. But if you want to pick a side anyway, the way to go is FlipSid3.
http://csgo.guru/match/70|https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9140|mouz|Godsent|Godsent|0.52|0.68|-0.16000000000000003|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Third match of the DreamHack Masters Malmo Quarter-Finals, and here we're expecting to watch a fairly balanced matchup. GodSent started their journey suffering a 16-11 defeat versus Natus Vincere, mostly triggered due to a far too risky map pick. However they quickly moved back on track and surprisingly managed to reach playoffs following victories over CLG and Gamers2.Ttwo matches that were far from easy, particularly for a newly formed roster. Anyway this event surely shed some light on the very high potential of this roster, and we'll likely watch them doing pretty well in the future too. On the other hand, Mousesports are actually the team showing the best things within the 2nd Tier. In the short-term, the German mix looked extremely consistent and have become a serious threat to Tier-1 rosters as well. Here in Malmo they hit the top of their Group, and forced others to the Deciders, such as Luminosity and Liquid, so ChrisJ and his gang are surely peaking right now and offering performances way above their average. Its worth mentioning that we now have moved to the BO3 format we might watch them slowing down their run a bit. About maps, we'll likely watch de_cbble, de_cache and de_train. If the Veto will take this way, Cache should be in favor of Mouz, while Train may go to GodSent and Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Mousesports, and this is correct since the Germans should sport a more complete knowledge on the extended map-pool compared to Pronax and friends. At our end we're prone in sticking with Mousesports as well, but honestly this is going to be a quite even game and we wouldn't be surprised to watch OTs and close scores.
http://csgo.guru/match/71|https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9250|AGG|E-Frag|AGG|0.48|0.36|0.12|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|GO:CL Semi-Final and on paper a pretty balanced matchup. AGG lately aren't really experiencing their brightest moment, and since their departure from Vexed, the Poles struggled in keeping their level on par with the rest of the European mid-tier teams. However, worth mentioning that during the last weeks they somehow managed to bounce back a bit, and their 3-2 victory over Epsilon in the Hitbox Grand-Final is surely promising. On the other hand, E-Frag generally always offered slightly more consistent shows compared to AGG, but in the short-term the Bulgarians are experiencing a pretty relevant amount of peaks and valleys, and overall the team isn't offering solid results as during the early part of April, when they managed to score a quite good winning streak. Talking about maps, we're expecting to watch de_mirage, de_overpass and de_cache. If the veto will take this path, Mirage may end in favor of AGG, while E-Frag should be advantaged on both Overpass and Cache. Betting odds are still floating around decent percentages, so at our end we're oriented in going with a Low pick on E-Frag, since we find them slightly more reliable than AGG.

However, honestly we believe that LG are a bit underestimated, this doesn't mean that you have to bet on them or that they're going to beat NaVi, but just that their lineup, featuring Pyth + DevilWalk may perform a bit better than expected, and provide a decent challenge in at least a map. Anyway, talking about the betting-side, this is a plain skip.
http://csgo.guru/match/118|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4684|CLG|Liquid|CLG|0.6|0.62|-0.020000000000000018|MEDIUM RISK|AVG BET|Just another NA derby, this time between a couple of teams that are pretty aligned. CLG yesterday did surprisingly good against C9, and despite they were playing with a stand-in, they still managed to take C9 to OT in the 2nd map, and overall they offered a solid show. Liquid faced more issues against Mouz, and they didn't understand at all the Mouz's way to play, heavily focused in countering their opponent, however for sure today will be easier for them, since this is a Local game, and both teams know each other pretty well. About maps, we wouldn't be surprised to watch a weird veto, and this kind of match-ups are usually kinda prone to upsets. There are good chances to see : de_mirage, de_train and de_cache as maps. If this happens, Mirage should be in favor of CLG, while both Cache and Train can go both ways. Current CSGL odds are around 60/40 in favor of CLG, so pretty fair, but due the composition of this match we're more oriented in trying our luck with a Low bet on Liquid.
http://csgo.guru/match/119|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=4570|NiP|TSM|TSM|0.45|0.36|0.09000000000000002|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|One of the best matches we'll enjoy today. TSM didn't play too much in the past weeks, they skipped ESWC and they failed pretty hard during ESL/ESEA Finals, where they went out during GroupStage after a couple of embarrassing performances. Basically the last Lan they played seriously is the first stage of FaceIT Finals, back in June, where they managed to hit the first spot, so it's safe to say that they took a little summer break right after that performance. Right now we don't really know their current form, and they're playing with their cards covered, so they're a bit of a question mark. On the other hand NiP lately are playing Bo1s better than Bo3s, and they seem more on point during GroupStages rather than Playoffs, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them doing fine, even if TSM are a bit their black beast, and they usually suffer their gameplay a lot, in particular if they'll end playing on de_cache. Current CSGL odds are still fine, and quite even, so we feel more confident in going Low on TSM, with the hope to watch them moving back on the right track.

On the other hand CLG keeps doing little steps in the right direction, but we believe they're still quite far from T1 EU teams, even if the Bo1 will for sure help them a bit. Current CSGL odds are quite bad already, so you can either skip or go Avg on NiP, but honestly we're more for skip (there are better match for transferring skins to bots).

Mouz just completed their preparation prior ESLOne and they moved here well trained and ready to mess with T1 teams, while Cloud9 are rolling strong since early Summer and they turned into a serious T1 contender, fully capable to take down most of the teams they face. Odds are currently 60/40 in favor of C9, but actually both teams share a kinda similar veto pattern, and we'll probably enjoy a quite close Bo1 and maybe an OT as well. Just like above we're more oriented in gambling with Odds and attempting a Low/ICB bet on Mouz.

Actually CSGL odds for this Bo3 aren't anything exceptional, and TSM are for sure advantaged, however, we need to remember that Kinguin are currently pretty random, and they may grab a map and provide more fight than expected. About maps, there are good chances to watch de_dust2, de_overpass and de_train. If the veto will go so, D2 should go to TSM, while both Overpass and Train can easily go both way. CSGL odds are currently pretty off, so the best idea is going for an ICB on Kinguin and keep your fingers crossed.
http://csgo.guru/match/148|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5115|mouz|D&G|mouz|0.65|0.78|-0.13|MEDIUM RISK|AVG BET|This match is a backup one, and it has been added as 'last chance qualifier' in order to fill the spot that EnvyUs left empty. Mouz are just back from their not-so-exciting run at ESL One Cologne, and technically their form should be pretty decent, however we fear that their mind is not actually here, hopefully NiKo will be able to bring some freshness (he'll sub for ChrisJ). On the other hand, D&amp;G are basically the lineup that is born from the ashes of Gamers2, with just the addition of Loord, a quite promising pick, mostly because the huge experience boost he can provide. For this game they'll play with Morelz, subbing for MINISE, according to our Polish boyz not the best pick out there. Current CSGL odds are pretty skewed in favor of Mouz, but honestly we believe they'll be able to grab this Bo3, and D&amp;G, just like the old G2 lineup, never played matches featuring an extended map-pool in a consistent way. Our pick is an Avg bet on Mouz
http://csgo.guru/match/150|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5112|CLG|Liquid|CLG|0.6|0.78|-0.18000000000000005|MEDIUM RISK|AVG BET|This is the first NA we cover in several months, as many of you are already aware of, we took a pause from the NA scene in June due the never-ending-shuffle that kept mixing the cards twice a week. Actually the current situation seems a bit more stable, so it's time to provide again some love to NA games. Talking about the current match, both teams never shone on the International soil, but locally they are pretty fine, since most of the NA teams share the same meta, with just C9 (and partially, ex-LG) standing out from the bunch. Usually CLG are a bit more consistent than Liquid, in particular on the extended map-pool, however we need to note that Hiko is currently standing-in (he's on a trial) for Liquid, and this may help a bit, even if his form isn't extremely high (61/100 according to our Ranking) or comparable to the first Quarter of the year. About maps, as displayed in our Veto Pattern graph, de_dust2, de_overpass, de_mirage and de_train are all pretty popular picks, and there are good chances to watch all of them if the match will last more than a Bo3. If it goes so, D2 and Mirage (here the edge is pretty low) should be in favor of CLG, while Overpass and Train are usually pretty random and can easily go both ways. Anyway, the default 1-0 is a pretty big advantage, and we doubt we'll watch CLG wasting it, or losing two Bo3s in a row, so, even if CSGL odds are currently pretty bad, we're oriented in picking an Avg bet on CLG.
http://csgo.guru/match/151|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5146|VP|TSM|VP|0.5|0.52|-0.020000000000000018|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Basically the only really interesting match scheduled, and the only one we're going to cover today, since the rest of the games are below Tier 3, or part of the Qualifiers for the World Championship (we won't cover it till Playoff, most of the current matches are pretty weird and don't follow any pattern). Talking about the teams, yesterday VP managed to roll over Kinguin in a pretty easy fashion, while TSM experienced hard times with NaVi, failing pretty hard in both Dust2 and Overpass, despite a pretty promising start on Mirage (a map where NaVi are usually on-point). The current match will be played as Bo5, so the Veto-session is not relevant as it is in Bo3 games, and then we need to read our Veto Pattern graph in a bit different way, basically looking for the side with the straightest line, this will show how much a team is consistent on the extended map pool. Another important factor is the Form, and according to our World Ranking, TSM (despite their disappointing performance vs NaVi) are actually sporting a pretty high short-term score (67.78), while VP are floating considerably lower (61.9, and this value is so mostly due Pasha being quite inconsistent in the last Quarter, not on par with the rest of his team). According to this, we believe we'll watch TSM doing better on the classic maps, while VP will likely perform better on the new ones; with de_cbble and de_dust2 very likely vetoed off. Current CSGL odds are slightly skewed in favor of VP, but we're talking about a pure 50/50 Tier1 game, so at our end we're oriented in playing a bit with these percentages, and our pick is a Low bet on TSM.
http://csgo.guru/match/152|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5170|HR|E-Frag|E-Frag|0.55|0.56|-0.010000000000000009|MEDIUM RISK|LOW BET|Pretty interesting Tier 2 game, both teams didn't play too much during the past month, and the last relevant tournament they played is the APM Finals back in early August, where both sides faced multiple times with alternate results. Talking about the current match, the 99DMG Arena is mostly a warming up cup, so we don't expect amazing performances and overall we wouldn't be surprised to watch teams playing quite below their full potential. However, usually the Bo3 format is a bit more in favor of HR, since they're slightly more solid on the extended map-pool, while Efrag most of the times need a more specific veto in order to provide a solid show in Bo3 games. Actually we didn't add the APM data to the site yet, so our Veto Pattern graph is missing several key Head2Head matches that are important in order to analyze this match-up, anyway by crossing the Veto-Lines of both teams you can easily figure out which maps are shared; so there are good chances to watch : de_cache, de_overpass and de_inferno. If the veto will go so, Overpass is in favor of HR, while Inferno and Cache can easily go both ways. Current CSGL odds are trending in favor of HR, but at our end we're more oriented in attempting a Low bet on EFrag mostly because the more rewarding percentages, since we're not talking about a super-relevant match and both teams aren't really in form yet.
http://csgo.guru/match/153|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5208|Fnatic|Dignitas|Fnatic|0.7|0.91|-0.21000000000000008|MEDIUM RISK|ICB BET|Not much to say about this game since CSGL odds already turned into trash, and betting with percentages around 90/10 is pointless. However, Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) are clearly advantaged, and despite Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.7) managed to show good things, there are pretty good chances to watch a plain 2-0. About maps, we'll likely watch : de_overpass, de_train and de_mirage, if the veto will go so Fnatic should be advantaged on both Mirage and Train, while Overpass could be a tiny bit more balanced. As stated above, the CSGL odds are terrible, so you can either skip or go for a #yolo ICB on Dignitas (if you've some spare cents to waste).
http://csgo.guru/match/154|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5234|D&G|Titan|null|0.45|0.18|0.27|HIGH RISK|ICB BET|Here Titan might have their chances to redeem themselves from the several really disappointing results achieved in the past weeks, yesterday against HR they already managed to bounce back after just another last-half choke against Mouz, so overall we can say that their issues are quite mitigated by the Bo2 format, and they're doing generally better in CEVO compared to Bo3s games. On the other hand D&amp;G (Tier3, Form: 53.9) are still quite random and not really consistent, they keep alternating God-Like days with horrible ones, and they're kinda unpredictable, however what we can for sure affirm is that they are usually relevant on just a quite limited amount of maps, and if Titan will handle the veto smartly there are good chances for watching a plain 2-0 in favor of the French side. Unfortunately (and luckily for the Polish fans) Titan aren't famous for their good veto sessions, so we'll likely watch : de_mirage and de_overpass as maps, and if the veto goes so we'll likely watch a pretty tight and balanced match. Current CSGL odds are overly skewed in favor of Titan, so we're oriented in trying our luck with an ICB on D&amp;G.
http://csgo.guru/match/156|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5240|HR|Reason|HR|0.7|0.81|-0.1100000000000001|MEDIUM RISK|AVG BET|This is a quite low-tier game, but an interesting one because we consider the new Reason lineup as a Challenger team (== a team that soon may step into the Tier3). Overall there isn't much data available for King Hunden and friends, and so far they mostly played against quite low teams, with the only exceptions of Property (that within our World Ranking are frozen, due their unstable roster) and E-Frag (the Bulgarian side won by measure), and honestly we kinda doubt we'll watch them doing fine in more than a map. About HR, currently they're a bit in a slump compared to the rest of the top-ranked Tier2 teams (Mouz &amp; Dig), and lately they looked quite lost strats-wise, but they're still fully capable to mess with Reason and they have good chances to take this game with a plain 2-0. Current CSGL odds are still decent for an Average bet on HR, so this is our pick, and overall in the worst case we should watch a Tie.
http://csgo.guru/match/157|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5266|Dignitas|Titan|Titan|0.5|0.32|0.18|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Here we are again! Say welcome to just another episode of the endless battle between Titan and Dignitas, where Titan are (desperately) trying to keep their Tier1 spot, while Dignitas, (together with Mouz) are assaulting it relentlessly on a daily basis. This is a CEVO match, so we're talking about a Bo2, currently Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) are facing pretty hard days, their consistence in Bo3 matches is pretty questionable and they keep losing focus during the final part of the matches, the crucial moment when we talk about 50/50 match-ups. However, today we're talking about a Bo2, and this is a format that for sure will help a bit the French side, while Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 59.5) are usually a bit vulnerable when they're forced to play in maps they don't like (as we observed in their latest game against Mouz, where the veto didn't exactly go as they were hoping). About maps, there are quite huge chances to watch : de:_mirage and de_mirage and de_cbble. If the veto will go so, Mirage lately is trending in favor of Titan, while Cbble is mostly 50/50. Current CSGL odds are slightly favoring Titan, and honestly we doubt we'll watch them losing both maps, so we agree with the trend and we pick a Low+ bet on them as well.
http://csgo.guru/match/158|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5276|Na'Vi|Dignitas|Na'Vi|0.6|0.79|-0.19000000000000006|MEDIUM RISK|AVG BET|First match of the day, and also first match-up of the PGL 'Last Chance' group that will define the last finalist that will take part to the Lan Finals in October. These games, unlike the GroupStage matches we enjoyed so far, will use the Bo1 format, so they may lead to upsets and nothing is written in stone. Talking about the match it self, yesterday NaVi didn't manage to put up a great fight against TSM, and they lost de_overpass in a quite dumb way, by choking the easiest side. On the other hand yesterday Dignitas had to deal with a stand-in (Maziaz instead of Nico) and overall they played quite bad in their CEVO game against Titan, and even worse versus Mouz a day before. Obviously nailing the correct map is way harder due the Bo1 format, in this case we believe we'll watch de_mirage, and if it goes so NaVi should be advantaged (but they MUST fix their CT side). Current CSGL odds aren't exceptional, and currently floating around 80/20 in favor of NaVi, but honestly they're advantaged and we believe they'll move forward in facing Kinguin in the next match that will be played later today, so our pick is an Avg bet on them.
http://csgo.guru/match/159|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5269|NME|coL|null|0.25|0.15|0.1|LOW RISK|AVG BET|The North American match we picked this evening is mostly relevant for understanding the power-links within the NA scene, rather than for plain betting (CSGL odds are already quite off). Enemy and coL are quite new lineups, born from the summer shuffle, with diametrically opposed way to play the game, additionally they both sport several quite promising youngsters, so there are good chances to watch an interesting and fast-paced match and maybe a final result a bit closer than expected. CompLexity are currently doing pretty fine, they already showed that they can mess with both Liquid and CLG, so they're obviously favored for taking this match, on the other hand Enemy aren't too bad but looks like they've serious issues in closing the games despite the promising starts. Current CSGL odds are pretty bad and barely rewarding, so you can either skip or (if you really wish to bet) go for an Avg+ bet on coL (we doubt we'll watch them losing twice, and in the worst case we'll probably watch a Tie).
http://csgo.guru/match/160|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5293|mouz|Kinguin|Kinguin|0.5|0.4|0.09999999999999998|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Today we'll enjoy the last series of PGL 'Last Chance' matches, just like yesterday these games are chained, so we'll start with the current one, then we'll move forward to NaVi vs (winner of Mouz/Kinguin), and we'll end with the Group Final (played as Bo3) between TSM and the winner of the NaVi-Mouz/King match-up. This game and the following one will be played as Bo1, so as usual we'll enjoy a quite unpredictable fight, mostly decided by the veto-session together with some luck, rather than accurate planning. However we're sure that this will be a quite exciting game to watch. Both teams are currently rolling pretty fine, and looks like that Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) finally managed to re-acquire some self-confidence. Yesterday they managed to beat Dignitas with a clean 16-13 on Mirage and they ended the day with a 2-1 victory over Fsid3 in the FaceIT Qualifier Final, so we're sure they'll move here with a quite high motivation. On the other hand Mouz (Ranked 2nd in Tier2, Form: 64.4) are the hottest Tier2 team of the past two weeks, and looks like they're a step above Dignitas (they tilt frequently) and HR (they're inconsistent as hell). Additionally they already managed to take down Titan plenty of times in the short-term and they're the favorite candidate for switching with them in the Tier1 Olympus. Talking about the current match, current CSGL odds are skewed in favor of Kinguin mostly because two factors, the first one is the huge amount of Kinguin supporters scattered around the globe, but the 2nd is the previous Head to Head that these team had in early August during the PGL Qualifier, where Kinguin managed to take the Bo5 Final with a clean 3-0 score (Mouz later managed to Qualify via an 'Emergency Qualifier' happened as result of the EnvyUs's withdrawn). However we suggest to don't give too much importance to this result, since we're talking about a match happened in mid-summer and about a month ago. About the map, this time there are multiple possibilities since both teams share a kinda similar pattern, so the most likely options are de_mirage, de_train and de_overpass, but at our end we trend towards Mirage. If this will be the case, Mouz may have a little edge, but overall we're talking about a pure 50/50 game. Betting Odds are globally trending in favor of Kinguin, but as we stated above we really believe we'll enjoy a balanced game, so our pick is a Low bet on Mousesports.
http://csgo.guru/match/163|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5297|Na'Vi|Kinguin|Kinguin|0.6|0.58|0.020000000000000018|MEDIUM RISK|AVG BET|This is the 2nd PGL 'Last Chance' game, and due the very short pause between matches (they're all chained) we need to be super-quick with our thoughts. Kinguin just rolled over Mouz in a pretty easy fashion, and this wasn't expected at all, in particular we weren't really expecting to watch de_train as pick, of course it was in the 'magic 3 circle' but also the worst choice for Mouz. About NaVi looks like they're currently facing some internal issues, and they easily turn angry to each other too frequently and mid-match, this is causing a drop in their performance and motivation, and for sure played a role in their 2-0 defeat against HR happened yesterday. However, they are a top-tier team, and they can handle a Bo1 even if not in their best condition. Current CSGL odds are quite aligned with our real-world ones, so we're oriented in going with a Low/Avg bet on NaVi.

Both teams already faced each other just few days ago, and Kinguin (Ranked 8th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) managed to grab a 2-1 victory after a quite shaky first map, then in the following days they somehow managed to fix some of their issues and currently they're on a quite nice streak and yesterday they displayed really good things against TSM too. On the other hand Efrag (Ranked 6th in Tier2, Form: 59.7) aren't bad at all, and the LAN environment may boost a bit their teamplay, even if we need to say that they didn't face any real top-tier opponent in the short-term (with the exclusion of Kinguin and HR), so we're not so sure we'll watch them taking more than a map. About the veto, in our opinion and according to our Veto Pattern graph, we'll likely watch : de_dust2, de_mirage and de_train. If it goes so, Dust2 may go to EFrag, while Mirage is in favor of Kinguin, and Train can easily go both ways. Overall the Betting Odds are pretty skewed in favor of Scream &amp; friends, but this match could be more tight than expected, so we don't see any reason for not attempting an ICB on the Bulgarian side.
http://csgo.guru/match/165|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5352|Method|NME|Method|0.56|0.8|-0.24|HIGH RISK|ICB BET|Just a quick note about this game, since it's featuring pretty sweet Betting Odds, while in reality we'll very likely watch a pretty close game. Method are for sure a bit advantaged because they're sticking together since a quite long time (they're the former Fenix lineup) compared to Enemy, and in the short-term they also started providing promising results against top-5 teams, so for sure they are a team to watch. On the other hand Enemy technically shouldn't be too far, and their lineup is potentially a bit better, but their gameplay isn't mature yet and quite prone to dumb mistakes. As stated in the first line, Odds are quite skewed in favor of Method so an ICB on Enemy may pay off.

Overall SK played pretty well against D&amp;G and we're kinda surprised by the cold blood they displayed, additionally we need to note that they already managed to beat Hellraisers several times in the short-term and looks like that they know how to counter them effectively. Obviously HR are a high-ranked Tier2 team and even if lately they're experiencing issues they're obviously slightly favored. Betting Odds are heavily in favor of the CIS side, while we believe we'll watch a tough match, so our pick is a Low bet on SK.
http://csgo.guru/match/167|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5377|Titan|VP|Titan|0.4|0.25|0.15000000000000002|HIGH RISK|ICB BET|This game is scheduled to start right after NaVi vs Kinguin, currently playing @ Gaming Paradise, and considering that map3 is ongoing, there are just few mins available and we need to be shorter than usual. Currently VP (Ranked 4th in Tier1, Form: 63.0) are doing pretty well and in the short-term they managed to beat most of the average T1 opponents, they only fell against EnvyUs, which is overall a pretty scary opponent. On the other hand Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) in the past weeks mostly battled with Tier2 teams rather than T1 ones, but looks like that they stepped up a bit on Lan and their performance (early today) against Mouz was pretty convincingly. About maps, there are good chances to watch : de_cbble, de_mirage and de_overpass. If the veto will follow this pattern, Cbble and Overpass should be quite balanced and aligned to 50/50, while Mirage is in favor of VirtusPro. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of VP due their better short-term performances and a solid H2H history in facing Titan, but honestly despite they are for sure advantaged percentages are really too skewed, and with these odds we're more oriented in attempting an ICB on Titan.

Betting odds are currently pretty bad, but we're talking about a kinda safe game, so it's quite normal. Our pick is an Avg-High bet on LG, but if you don't like to bet on skewed odds you can skip without regrets.
http://csgo.guru/match/169|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5381|SK|FSid3|FSid3|0.4|0.32|0.08000000000000002|MEDIUM RISK|AVG BET|Here we've a quite unpredictable match between two teams that lately are struggling a bit, SK (Ranked 5th in Tier3, Form: 50.6) are playing in a pretty random way since many weeks now, they keep alternating good results versus T2 teams, with terrible ones against teams that shouldn't be an issue at all. As we stated many times already, their main problem is their heavy mid-game inconsistency, they are totally unable to follow the same pattern for more than a round. On the other hand Fsid3's teamplay improved a lot since S1mple left, but unfortunately now they lack of raw fire-power, and despite they consolidated their position within the Tier2, they still have issues in messing with high-ranked teams. The good part is that usually they show decent things against teams like SK, so we're confident we'll watch them winning at least a map. About maps, in our opinion we'll watch : de_train and de_cbble (or de_mirage). If the veto goes so, FlipSid3 (Ranked 5th in Tier2, Form: 56.6) should be better on both, while D2, if picked may go to SK. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Fsid3, obviously they are a bit more skewed than real-world ones, but honestly we kinda agree on this trend, and Fsid3 should be able to win at least a map and (in the worst case) Tie the match.

http://csgo.guru/match/171|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5433|Fnatic|TSM|TSM|0.6|0.71|-0.10999999999999999|HIGH RISK|LOW BET|Here is the match between the winners of the Group B entry games. Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) as expected didn't face any real issue in rolling over Titan on Cobblestone, and their executions were looking so easy that made us think that they still have plenty of margin. On the other hand TSM (Ranked 3rd in Tier1, Form: 67.7) played an extremely good match against VP, and achieving a fair and square 16-10 victory on Overpass, where VP are usually quite on-point, isn't an easy task at all. Talking about the current match, Fnatic are obviously favored and the team to beat, honestly we don't believe they have any weak map in particular that TSM may use to make the game more even, maybe just Train may leave some doors opened, but the chances to watch it aren't extremely high. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Fnatic, and we agree on this, so our pick is an Avg bet on the Swedish side. However CSGL percentages are actually REALLY skewed, so also an ICB on TSM is a legit option (if you like cents), and for sure a bit more 'relaxed' pick than going high on Fnatic and then sweating like a bear in summer if the match will be -suddenly- closer than expected.
http://csgo.guru/match/172|http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5440|Fnatic|Titan|Fnatic|0.7|0.89|-0.19000000000000006|MEDIUM RISK|ICB BET|This is the Group B 2nd place decider match, and the winner of this game will move forward to playoffs and face VirtusPro in the second Semifinal. Honestly there isn't much to say, Betting odds are already extremely off, so this is mostly a nice match to watch rather than to bet on. Yesterday Fnatic (Ranked 1st in Tier1, Form: 70.08) surprisingly managed to lose against TSM, but it was deserved since the Danish side performed God-Like during OT, however de_dust2 is always a tricky map, and we don't even know why Fnatic didn't ban it, since it's one of the few maps where they are a bit below their average level. On the other hand Titan (Ranked 8th in Tier1, Form: 62.2) finally woke up a bit, and cleaned their poor entry game performances with a superb show against NaVi. For sure the Bo3 format is in clearly advantage of Fnatic, they are generally better on the extended map-pool, and there are good chances to watch a plain final 2-0 in their favor. As we stated above Betting odds are quite terrible, so you can either skip or try a #yolo ICB on Titan (but the chances to watch an upset are quite remote). With these percentages, there is no point in going High on Fnatic for basically no reward.
