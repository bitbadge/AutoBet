Match [guruUrl=http://csgo.guru/match/2, loungeUrl=http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5697, team1=Dignitas, team2=Imm, winner=Dignitas, realOdds=0.6, loungeOdds=0.89, difference=-0.29000000000000004, risk=MEDIUM RISK, betSize=ICB BET, prediction=Here we've a bit more interesting and (on the paper) balanced game, compared to the previous (Group A) one. Immunity (Tier3, Form: 51.7) obviously are a bit of a question mark, since they can't face Euro teams on a consistent basis due their location. However in their previous shows they always provided performances in line with the Tier3, so we wouldn't be surprised to watch them setting up a decent fight against Dignitas, even if the chances of watching them taking the whole Bo3 are quite low. On the ther hand Dignitas (Ranked 3rd in Tier2, Form: 62.0) are obviously favored, they are part of the four top-ranked Tier2 teams looking for a Tier1 spot, and even if lately they stepped back a bit they are still pretty capable to deal with most of the T2-3 teams around. Betting odds are obviously trending in favor of Dignitas, and even if we agree on this trend, unfortunately the percentages are quite terrible and nowhere profitable. So we're a bit more oriented in attempting a #yolo ICB on Immunity just in order to add some pepper into the salad (but the chances for it to pay off are pretty low).]
Match [guruUrl=http://csgo.guru/match/3, loungeUrl=http://csgolounge.com/match?m=7022, team1=SKDC, team2=WinterFox, winner=WinterFox, realOdds=0.5, loungeOdds=0.36, difference=0.14, risk=HIGH RISK, betSize=LOW BET, prediction=As we get ready for DreamHack Winter, we do have one match of note on the schedule for tonight. Kind of an interesting low-end matchup for a best of three StarSeries contest. SKDC certainly isn't one the more relevant low teired teams, but gained some exposure during the RGN Pro Series. But more importantly they gained some much needed experience battling some of the more established and notable teams of the scene. However they didn't perform too well in their recent relevant matches, and are surely a good ways off from competing with the upper T3+ teams, but considering some of the recent bumps we've seen from their NA opponents here, we could see this game go to third map. The recent bumps of Winterfox just mentioned, were largely evident during their brief appearance at RGN. Granted, it was one of the very first events for the currently composed Wfx roster, but honestly we expected a little bit more from them than what they brought. Especially after a respectable entry game victory over Torqued. But since that win, Wfx's struggles have been on full display, even in their last online match vs 3sUP. So this should make for a good opponent for them to try and rebuild some confidence. Since these two teams, as currently composed, have no real match history to reference the veto will likely be driven by whichever maps both teams played well together in practice. So theres no basis to guess the final selection. Ordinarily we'd expect Wfx to be able to grab by a possible 2-0 sweep, but their recent troubles will likely see them lose at least one map, and even a chance to blow the contest all together, putting real-world odds at a 50/50 toss-up. But on our end, we believe the raw team skill of Wfx should be able to prevail, so our pick is a Low bet on them.]
Match [guruUrl=http://csgo.guru/match/4, loungeUrl=http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8433, team1=mouz, team2=NiP, winner=mouz, realOdds=0.55, loungeOdds=0.32, difference=0.23000000000000004, risk=HIGH RISK, betSize=LOW BET, prediction=Day One in Poland for the 2016 IEM Katowice, sporting an impressive roster of teams battling it out over the next four days, and we begin with the Round-Robin Group Stage. The first of the opening matches for this BO1 hell, features a pretty interesting matchup between Mousesports and NiP. Mouz has a had a decent start to the year, playing pretty consistently at a high T2 level, and have certainly made a strong case as a T1 prospect. At APM Finals, we watched the Germans dominate the field without losing a single map. So theres no question regarding their LAN capabilities, though here they'll surely have a more difficult path to travel, beginning with the Swedes who managed to to edge them out, twice, online last week for EPL. NiP on the other hand, have actually been one of the least active T1 teams of this first Quarter. However, to some surprise, the downtime seems to have had little to no affect, on their effectiveness and executions. But this will be their first LAN appearance of the year, so we wouldn't be too surprised to see them going through a small period of adjustment moving offline. Overall, F0rest and friends are good form entering the week, backed by a series of encouraging results. Betting Odds are trending in favor of the Swedes, which is correct, especially since they've already topped the Germans in their first two meeting this year. But Real-World Odds are way closer to even than the percentages we're seeing right now. Although they manged to wins those contests, but by the slimmest of margins, including some OT. On our end, we're inclined to pick the Swedes as well. But if the percentages reach 75/25, we're oriented toward trying our luck with an ICB on Mousesports, in hopes they take advantage of some NiP LAN rust for their entry game.]
Match [guruUrl=http://csgo.guru/match/5, loungeUrl=http://csgolounge.com/match?m=8736, team1=LG, team2=Selfless, winner=Selfless, realOdds=0.58, loungeOdds=0.92, difference=-0.3400000000000001, risk=HIGH RISK, betSize=LOW BET, prediction=Moving forward in the IBP Invitational Quarter-Final, between Selfless and Luminosity. Little time, so getting right to it. LG was top seed and awarded a bye through the first round. So this is their first game today. They're coming off a mediocre performance with Cloud9, where the two split the EPL set. But Overall, the Brazilians at right at the top near the Swedes, so they're surely a level above shakier American-side. Selfless on the other hand,had to work their way into this match, by sweeping WinterFox 2-0. But they had to sweat for the 2nd map, but managed to end it quickly. Overall, Relyks and co. don't quite sport the firepower to match the Brazilian-side, so we doubt they'll manage more than a single map with the extended map-pool in play. So our pick is Low Bet Luminosity, or just skip since the percentages aren't really rewarding enough.]
Match [guruUrl=http://csgo.guru/match/6, loungeUrl=https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8926, team1=CSGL, team2=ATN, winner=CSGL, realOdds=0.55, loungeOdds=0.71, difference=-0.15999999999999992, risk=HIGH RISK, betSize=LOW BET, prediction=Not too much about this Operation Kinguin matchup. CSGL has recently shown some signs of stability, as they've managed to add two event dates to their calander. The Poles in the past months have seem to regain some consistency they've been in absence of, generally, for quite some time. And in March alone, they successful managed to secure their tickets for both DH Malmo, and just the other day adding DH Austin as well. And bring with them today, actually a decent winning streak and set of positive peformances. Meanwhile ALTERNATE aTTaX has really fall in a hard times recetly, in contrast to the Polish-side have collected a stretch of dispappointing outings. While CSGL was grabbing theor spot in DH, the Germans failed to even threaten in the closed qualifiy. And as for this matchup, they may likely manage to puch the contetst to a third map, but overall, we doubt they manage to upset the Poles while running on their current peak. So on our end, we're in agreement with percentages trendoing in favor of the Poles, so on our end, we're oriented in going with a Low Bet on CSGL, with expectation of watching them continue perform at a level on par with much of the Tier-2.]
