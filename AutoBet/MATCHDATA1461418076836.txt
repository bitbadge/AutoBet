Match [guruUrl=http://csgo.guru/match/6, loungeUrl=https://csgolounge.com/match?m=8926, team1=CSGL, team2=ATN, winner=CSGL, realOdds=0.55, loungeOdds=0.71, difference=-0.15999999999999992, risk=HIGH RISK, betSize=LOW BET, prediction=Not too much about this Operation Kinguin matchup. CSGL has recently shown some signs of stability, as they've managed to add two event dates to their calander. The Poles in the past months have seem to regain some consistency they've been in absence of, generally, for quite some time. And in March alone, they successful managed to secure their tickets for both DH Malmo, and just the other day adding DH Austin as well. And bring with them today, actually a decent winning streak and set of positive peformances. Meanwhile ALTERNATE aTTaX has really fall in a hard times recetly, in contrast to the Polish-side have collected a stretch of dispappointing outings. While CSGL was grabbing theor spot in DH, the Germans failed to even threaten in the closed qualifiy. And as for this matchup, they may likely manage to puch the contetst to a third map, but overall, we doubt they manage to upset the Poles while running on their current peak. So on our end, we're in agreement with percentages trendoing in favor of the Poles, so on our end, we're oriented in going with a Low Bet on CSGL, with expectation of watching them continue perform at a level on par with much of the Tier-2.]
Match [guruUrl=http://csgo.guru/match/7, loungeUrl=https://csgolounge.com/match?m=9140, team1=mouz, team2=Godsent, winner=Godsent, realOdds=0.52, loungeOdds=0.68, difference=-0.16000000000000003, risk=HIGH RISK, betSize=LOW BET, prediction=Third match of the DreamHack Masters Malmo Quarter-Finals, and here we're expecting to watch a fairly balanced matchup. GodSent started their journey suffering a 16-11 defeat versus Natus Vincere, mostly triggered due to a far too risky map pick. However they quickly moved back on track and surprisingly managed to reach playoffs following victories over CLG and Gamers2.Ttwo matches that were far from easy, particularly for a newly formed roster. Anyway this event surely shed some light on the very high potential of this roster, and we'll likely watch them doing pretty well in the future too. On the other hand, Mousesports are actually the team showing the best things within the 2nd Tier. In the short-term, the German mix looked extremely consistent and have become a serious threat to Tier-1 rosters as well. Here in Malmo they hit the top of their Group, and forced others to the Deciders, such as Luminosity and Liquid, so ChrisJ and his gang are surely peaking right now and offering performances way above their average. Its worth mentioning that we now have moved to the BO3 format we might watch them slowing down their run a bit. About maps, we'll likely watch de_cbble, de_cache and de_train. If the Veto will take this way, Cache should be in favor of Mouz, while Train may go to GodSent and Cobblestone can easily go either way. Betting odds are currently trending in favor of Mousesports, and this is correct since the Germans should sport a more complete knowledge on the extended map-pool compared to Pronax and friends. At our end we're prone in sticking with Mousesports as well, but honestly this is going to be a quite even game and we wouldn't be surprised to watch OTs and close scores.]
